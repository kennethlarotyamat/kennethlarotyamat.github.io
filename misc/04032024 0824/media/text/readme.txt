I'm failing MIS 768. as in. I'm getting an F. I will have to audit
the course. an F is something that could take years to recover from
GPA wise. and when I mean recover, I simply mean having a GPA at a 
minimum acceptable level. a B average.

I really have no choice. I have to audit the course.
I also. have to file a patent.
and. yet again.
I. really. have no choice in the matter.

I think. one of the things that got me the
most interested in filing patents was. when I read
an article about the vanguard patent for the VTI ETF
being close to expiring. This was back in Missouri
when I was working at the hotel. I guess I finally
came around, four years later, to taking a detailed
look at the patent.

when I looked at the Vanguard VTI ETF patent, one thing
that immediately caught my eye was the section about the
patent application itself being under copyright protection,
and, when looking at other patent application files, not all
of them have that.
so I think.

I think I would file a copyright for the application material in
the patent application before submitting the patent application

I don't know how that last assignment went. It worked, I wanted to
spend more time with the comments, but I was one minute away from
the due date, and I had to just turn in what I had. I didn't even
want to really mess around with the code. I don't think that there 
was anything else for me to do. There was something that I wanted to
do. Oh, it was to remove the resource leak warnings, I remember, they
weren't errors, just warnings from the IDE that I usually do something
about, but I figured I didn't want to risk messing anything up.

what a nightmare! i just finished my last class exercise of week 5 
and it took me 8 hours to complete. and i still have an individual
assignment due, and usually these are more complex. I don't even
want to imagine how many millions of years this individual assignment
is going to take, and, I still think that I'm going to be behind.
I don't even want to think about how many millions of billions and
eternities this assignment is going to take.

When I first signed up for this class, I think that I wanted to
eventually convert some of whatever Java assignments I anticipated
completing into JavaScript files, and then displaying them here
on my landing page, but I just haven't come around to doing that.

from readme.md entry # 8

So today I learned that I actually can edit .md files in
Eclipse. I have to use a - there is something called a generic 
text editor. I'm writing this in eclipse.

So basically, I moved the location of my local GitHub repository. 
I moved it from my lap-top hard drive to my
external hard drive.

So this update is being written in Eclipse, I had to change
the readme file from a .md to a .txt. It might be possible
to edit a .md file in eclipse, but for whatever reason, it wasn't 
readily apparent to me how to do so.

...

For whatever reason I can't edit a .md file in eclipse.

...

I moved the location where I keep my local GitHub files. 
I'm going to commit this and see if this worked out.

I'm really tired right now.

i have to use a different IDE

so workspace save interval in minutes. I think setting it from 5 to 1. 
from five minutes to 1 minutes is essentially the same as auto-save. right?

let's put it this way
i haven't even started
and i'm already lost

there was a reading that i kind of missed

Oracle. (1995). Documentation: The Javaâ„¢ Tutorials - 
Object-Oriented Programming Concepts. Retrieved from

i remember downloading a modding
program for empire total war
and it was hosted on github
it can actually  mod any total war game

what was it. well, i don't remember it
having a landing page
and all the details were
right there on the github repository
so i guess i don't really need a landing page
for every repository

but it was a convention established
in the first programming course i took
so i think i'll continue to do it.

I don't even know where to begin.
I'm setting up a landing page for this repository

yeah, i honestly don't even know where to begin
i think that i might get caught up
or
I might get tied down creating
this landing page.

it's kind of nice to type with a keyboard
again. i've been using speech to text
for a while.
