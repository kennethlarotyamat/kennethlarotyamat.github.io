The Dog Story by Kenneth Larot Yamat dba Chestnut + Hazel (2024) 
 
There once was a dog named
Fellini the dog, and he was
Trying to make a movie about
how hard it really is to be a dog.
 
there are so many things that a dog, like
Fellini the Dog is responsible for.
I have to eat dog food all day
 
when I was a dog, said Fellini
the days would really never end, NEVER!
but you're still a dog, said Godard the Goose
 
Is it then true now that
your days still never end?
 
It's true, affirmed Fellini the Dog
to Godard the Goose, my days still never end!

The Duck Story (2024) by Kenneth Larot Yamat dba Chestnut + Hazel 
  
are you
the kind of
person who
feeds
the ducks
when you go to the pond?
 
or are you the
kind of person who 
EATS THE DUCKS!
when you GO TO THE
POND!
 
Kenneth did not know how to answer
because, even though there was a true
answer, Kenneth wasn't sure if the true answer
would also be the right answer
 
Look, said Kenneth, when I go to the
pond, and I don't usually go to the pond
but when I do go to the pond, I interact
with the ducks in a very human manner
