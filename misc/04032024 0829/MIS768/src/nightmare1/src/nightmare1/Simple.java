Haven't entered organization it resources is likely solution sufficient alone to create value it capabilities are just as needed in interfering relationships and organizations should know how to utilize these cap ability not to share it resources to create business about this ties in closely with an important revealing from the analysis that we were talking about earlier which is that it based government is highly connected to business value more so than any other interorganizational capabilities such as a it base relation specific assets it base knowledge sharing and it is complementary capabilities governments I kind of talk about it earlier basically how organizations manage and execute it capability company and the fender connected government information and you did some discussion questions that I came up with so my first question is how can organizations and interfer relationships successfully incorporate it basis governments that encourages it based corporation without compromising management and goals of each individual firm because anyone have any ideas farms and how can they create value okay without compromising by coming together so let's say you know we know the so let's say it's not you know being like rivals

Thanks for we have one person other than that I'm here so as you know as I explained in the last class which one so the schedule of the classes that we have a presentation and then we never discuss ion so I'll ask the first group to and I lost you and I told this class it was in the age of course this have you talking about the business value of it so just buy a show of answers because anyone work at it right now. That's cool so what type of industries are we working in for those who raise their hands you can just shut it out right cool thanks that kind of proves that there's a lot of value in it all right so we're going to be talking about the first paper and in this paper going to be talking about their relationship between it and organizational performance so

Investment intermediate through process space and effective so in what ways have you seen it bring bring value to a current company today

Went up and they didn't really like they kind of revamp got their internal software and they went from there like parts ordering part of it which is a major part of the business went from very like tedious doll space software to like a super effective database style and it was like the whole company just ended up being smoother

Oh well initially they had like these huge like is everybody familiar with like a dog space system that's like you know command lines number and you search for it and it was really the new one was like it was almost like a Google search engine anybody else

One of them at the ROI was effectively measuring how many positions we can eliminate unfortunately but that comes with automation right if you have a very manual task where you have two stylist systems and now you're able to bridge the two systems well now somebody's whole job which is to essentially enter data into second system roi unfortunately for that project another one is analytics so yeah you can have a very rudimentary and it looks like warm where you're just baked but you can get you can advance to have descriptive and prescriptive analytics for year now you're having a data tell you what you need to do to correct your fit right make sure that you are actually medium apis and bring the attention to the areas where you're leading money financ ially so that would be more receptive right here so how does it create value it creates value in certain conditions because it is both hardware and software we can't it doesn't create value in isolation but instead in conjunction certain things that even contribute to are it systems management business operations information assets organizational culture organization structure it can also show value in many ways because it shows as productivity as I think both of your examples right like fortunately you lost some people but it was automated and made the processes go a lot faster because all sitting productivity and I mean you save yourself so much time clearing one by one how you can just search for good stuff that's 100 reasons that you can see in productivity or through business optimization cutting those jobs right and even customer service so it base value is not a competitive advantage to it's important to know that and it also could take time to show because it is process based we know that things don't happen to immediately and over the time once you see that productivity that's when you kind of show so if you guys did read the readings stood out to me was the co-creation in it because business Dynamics are always changing and the lines are being less defined co-creation combines products into a smooth flow of information is increased by multiple parties co-creation increases it value because it invites multiple resources to expand on their capab ilities we learn later on that capabilities is what actually brings great examples of code creation or collaborative planning forecasting and replenishment this is why we see a trend right now and resource sharing anybody can give an example of

Things together you know bring ideas together create an overall value so have you seen an example of that in your yes oh no I want to say that I had a misunderstanding because I thought procreation evaluate was when like two organizations that are sort of different because they gave the example of like the RFID tags or something and then it said the vendor and the support did the saint s game at so co-creation can be at various levels so it could be the internal organized internal ization of working with a lot of like the other departments like the contact center is a huge one right and kind of picking them up to speed to find ways to make their jobs a lot easier and like handle the large volume of customers especially the growing number of people in Nevada and search everybody so it is able to provide them honestly I feel like as everybody

In this case the investments is the a the mediating factors like the be es are are resources so investments affect resources and resources are you capabilities and they affect argument so immediately between two other concerts and the first comes in and allows the causality to move from the first one to the final yet so I also wanted to share this table you guys probably saw this one too I thought it was really interesting how I showed the old research premises and kind of just overall things that we looked at during the readings and how they've now expanded them into for my understanding they kind of just went deeper into each theme right and they looked at it with a New perspective I kind of put a box around the new ones if you want to look at those I thought they were really into if not we can go have another discussion so is there value in co-creation we know the answer is yes so how can companies from an inner organizational perspective use different I want to hear some ways from some new voices how do we really think that we can see co-creation in our jobs and our life was like that is not necessarily something that is typing it's like working together today

I work extensively inside of a team that that called me right we sit down with the key stakeholders with from all the different departments we understand what the pains are and how it can help alleviate those things for example sales right you have sales people who maybe don't understand what accounts and you're focus on or maybe we need to be able to help them focus on more competitive conversions or problems it's our job on the it side to provide that data potentially apply Michigan operations as well to understand what that looks like and provide our operations with keys she brought up an interesting point you said that it's one of the challenges is figuring out kind of who takes the lead right or I guess organized so in yours in your case I'm sure you see that all the time have you guys used to be like you need that right the driver would be the business right whoever the department that's requesting these Chang es they should be the one put it together what I find the real world is that it's generally I do because it's our process that we're implementing even that's really now is it because they're more familiar with like kind of the backend what goes on and what will work it's because yeah because we put it together right so we know what buttons to click but when inevitably the user asks why are we clicking those buttons it doesn't happen

That we can work with as a mediator right that's going to help facilitate that adoption so that's I didn't even talk about cooperation

All different idea where does the other team can have military but that's good

I work a lot close with them but I do more like data science so could we work very close together and I help out a little bit but in that department I think you know sometimes answer


No I was just going to pick it back off of what she was saying with landscape just becoming more competitive it's kind of like up to survival to look for corporations because you can't yeah can't know everything so looking even externally I mean there are like examples where they do create something internally to spark some sort of innovation to to change the process or make it improve but well I'm in I'm in the topic of intro entrepreneurs so it's like an entrepreneurs where you hire from someone from the outside to to innovate a process it's the other way around where you do Foster like a entrepreneur mindset with an organization because you know sometimes trying to bring people outside that's however if you are in the organiz ation then you do already know it you know that so you can do that innovations like you for example you know how how you can use it to be right here you already know it perfect a lot of you like tightly coupled organizations like you are part of a child supply chain then you can have the extra note


Analysis so let's get different so for the introduction a little bit about this paper it was a meta-analysis of about 80 studies and we're going to be exploring the growing interesting joint it resources and keep up in mind those two phrases we're going to look at observations I don't know if that's something we should do anyone has anything to say about that okay so resource what is it yes okay it answer communicate so you know it's an IT resource that helped the web-based rent management learning system is the 90 s second question is going to be how do the method of methodological and contextual attributes affect the relationship it's working so this study uses a resource base you to explain the value so I






It is a bad company in other words are affect your way so they are either strengthening the relationship or their weakening rel ations so think of it as a contingency as a catalyst or organization all weekend so that that's not that's the concept of the world thank you so looking at this weather analysis they're hypothesis yeah that's true the first hypothesis was that inner organizational it capabilities lead directly to business value because they are developed specifically yeah specifically for the interim relationship he's capable the business value I think that kind of the capabilities were kind of that like mediator between the actual resources and the value right so in this case the capabilities


No they're actually independent they're correlation is with the strength of the relationship between kids so so they're making that relationship stronger so for example you know capabilities would lead to better Business value under certain conditions those conditions value going back to the hypothesis this is believed second hypothesis is that inner organizational resources do not lead directly to business value and I think that's kind of just like a piggyback off of the first step on because we know that there's no direct correlation between the resources and value


They have to find those intermediary stuff that you have here you have to make sure that those are being created so as to create and I kind of just wanted to take a second to explain the inner organiz ation some of the ones that we look at it based relation specific assets and her mind is saying those are specific ass like kind of like the UNLV I'm free webcam us it can be I'm in a relation specific asset would be more more what's a better example like right


How do you meet you last week so some other capabilities are IC based on are you guys all familiar with with three abilities okay so which ones please how do I do whatever you can go to internal like a internal website do your job process and so any sense


So you know like just like humans knowledge is part of town because it enables you these capabilities are not it's not like they're disconnected so something could be a relationship when you are fostering relations you're asked also fostering change that means you are also fostering knowledge sharing and knowledge so you know the concept of organizational memory and strategy and innovation because without an organization memory basically you cannot go forward because you need to know what has been what what were the good ideas and those good ideas and practices and procedures are stored in the in the in the database in people's minds organization memory is not only like just some database and also how the database is being you changed so it's the database and the people together and the entry and UNLV are doing certain things to make sure that you know this can be prevented or at least so whatever they're doing is becoming part of the organization you have the universe it base complementary capabilities who thinks they could share about that I want to hear some new voices


I decide a provided in front of the knowledge like some other department so I cannot get like Shar ing it and the people that is and it is also the interaction of the people and the it that is helping so because but who brings the people together who helps the people create a knowledge in fact so so it I mean it's not like the it has some ideas within it that suddenly come out no ID gives you a structure


I know something and you know something else we come together and 2 hours in your brainstorming maybe on the Microsoft teams meeting maybe

Actually

Po business process ing edition is based on creating complementary using complementary capabilities like very good example

We don't know how to utilize it then it'd be for nothing right and I imagine that if you're trying to do co-creation as well and trying to share it assets and it capabilities with each other that this that adding it based governance is even more important cuz you got to make sure that it works within all organizations that you're sharing those assets with so it's not governances and organiz ational so comes from the idea of government what that means is you basically embed what I mean into the very fabric of the organization ation so whatever you do we in the organization you know the rule of ID ina actually I have I'm part of some research where you know it shows what we find is just saying that I have it I have certain policies procedures for it governance is not enough you should actually there should be an organization Almighty so we actually understand what it means s rather than somebody saying that okay you know this is what you do you should use x software for this no the idea is you know why you're using it software and that is when it comes otherwise the check mark okay I need to do this I need to do but that does not make it successful necessary what basic successful you you use it and you know why I keep is used in a more meaningful manner yes I just want to break it again
Kind of upset of a process that ensures that effective and efficient use of the information technology and organ ization nowadays but the IT department it function in an organization and the business functions in your organization they operate very different they have completely different ideas and you know I can share some of my experience so I was a serious undergrad back in the days so I went to work and I realized that what the business completely different from what I was seeing or viewing or is wanting or the way I was understanding the system that's understanding the completely different and I understand it in a completely different the problem often times because the big problem because what they were saying so if this mismatch is there then it becomes very problematic for the value is blocked okay the business value so the real the business value actually comes from what we call it business strategic line and it governance is the broad idea that helps you achieve that that's very good point then I don't know

These notes are more or less useless - the text to speech didn’t work that well. - on top of that - it wasn’t really easy to organize - and - most of the technical jargon was transcribed with other words - or similar sounding words - it just wasn’t all that useful.

Development Commentary

It was by pure chance that I took module 3 to work on, or it wasn’t pure chance, but it wasn’t exactly a deliberate decision.

It was more that it was due module 3 is due way off in april, it was the assignment that was due later on.

It was by pure chance that I took module 3 to work on, or it wasn’t pure chance, but it wasn’t exactly a deliberate decision.

It was more that it was due module 3 is due way off in april, it was the assignment that was due later on.

So I didn’t end up working on the references page first. I actually started with the outline
