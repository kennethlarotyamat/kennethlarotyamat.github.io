what am I thinking about here

I want to look at the rosters for 764 and 768 to see if i have any classmates in both classes. since 768 is asycnhronous. i wouldn't see anyone.
there is no overlap between the two classes, other than me.

I prefer the Losee location. If you look at my pictures, you will see why: at the Losee location, the tomatoes are thick quarter slices, at this location, the durango location, the tomatoes were diced. When I think of diced tomatoes, I think of gas station hot dogs.

It was the same thing with the onions, they were diced, just like gas station hot dog onions.

This location also doesn't have anchovies or artichokes or linguica or mortadella. and honestly. I really think that I would have looked past the tomato and onion issue. if this location had anchovies.

I also spent 45 dollars on this pizza after an 8 dollar tip. I think 45 dollars for an 18 inch personal pizza is somewhat elevated. It's the kind of thing that I can look past. when the 45 dollar pizza has anchovies on it. but my 45 dollar pizza didn't have anchovies on it, because this location doesn't have anchovies.
