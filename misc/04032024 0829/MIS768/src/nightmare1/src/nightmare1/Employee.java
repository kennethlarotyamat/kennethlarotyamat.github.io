		//The void keyword
		// in Java is a reserved type used to specify that a method does not return
		// any data type. A method that is declared as void does not have a return type
		//, and it does not return a value when it is called.
		//For example, the following method prints "Hello, World!" to the console:
		//public void printMessage() {
		//  System.out.println("Hello, World!");
		// I had to cut my nails right now because i was finding it hard to type or maybe not hard but awkward

	// this comment is being written in VS Code
	// so i realized that there. well
	// i jumped into the assignment and was confused about what was going on
	// and i didn't realize that there were modules that led up to the assignment
	// or i mean. lab modules that led up to the assignment-specific lab modules.
	// so I was confused about a number of things before getting started.

	// i need to try and get all of my work done on Thursday, or, I mean I need to try to get all
	// of my coursework done on Thursday.
