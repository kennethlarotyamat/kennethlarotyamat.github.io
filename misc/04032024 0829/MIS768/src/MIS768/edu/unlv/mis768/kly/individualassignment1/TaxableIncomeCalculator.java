3.1: The Relation Between It And Organizational Innovation 
1: The Role Of It In Organizational Innovation
 
correlations: 	number of servers to firm performance
computing capacity to firm performance
storage capacity to firm performance
number of patents to it investments
it expertise and firm performance
patents filed to commercialized products
moderate competition stimulates innovation
intense competition depresses innovation

variables:		productivity 
sales performance 
profitability 
value added 
stock returns 
return on investment
Economies of scale
Architectural flexibility
Diminishing returns
Limited impact

influences:		firm alignment and orientation
			posture
			governance
			internal conflict
			internal and external context
group conflict hinders adoption
actively fostering innovation
informal mechanisms
industry dynamics
gender diversity
Knowledge integration
Key actors

frameworks:	resource based view
			capabilities based perspective
industry convergence
Organizational innovation system

cases:			polaroid - misalignment
			xerox - failure to capitalize
			yahoo - failure to capitalize
			hospitality incumbents - dismissive of disruptors
			pharmaceutical companies - r&d failures lead to patent
acquisition resulting in depressed firm performance

limitations:		knowledge gaps
			outcome measurement
			Conceptual abstraction hinders implementation
			Difficulties in establishing causation between variables
			
2: The Nonlinear Influence Of Harmonious Information Technology 


Frameworks: 	HITA - Harmonious IT affordance
			Non-linear vs quadratic
Affordances not inherent in people or artifacts, but
 organizational relationships
Distinctions between Affordances  & impediments 
Resonance - HITA alignment preserves organizational 
memory 
Organizational inertia - delays in implementation
Adaptation
Paradox - tensions between interdependent elements


limitations:		Few studies use non-linear frameworks
			Most studies assume linear relationships


Variables:		IT Affordance
			IT appropriation


Guidance:		Promote positive hita or impede negative HITA
			Managing tensions to promote innovations
			Finding and leveraging existing paradoxes to stimulate
innovation - converting tensions into synergies

Examples:		New Collaborations tools that don’t integrate well with 
Existing Organizational memory tools, reducing HITA
Paradoxes - when innovation increases despite increasing
organizational misalignment

        I tried to set the first article up for text to speech, but it was basically incomprehensible with all of the in-text citations.

Extant literature is literature that has survived

This audio version isn’t too bad

I can’t believe it’s 55 pages after processing.

Good lord it’s already thursday

correlations: 	number of servers to firm performance
computing capacity to firm performance
storage capacity to firm performance
number of patents to it investments
it expertise and firm performance
patents filed to commercialized products
moderate competition stimulates innovation
intense competition depresses innovation

variables:		productivity 
sales performance 
profitability 
value added 
stock returns 
return on investment
Economies of scale
Architectural flexibility
Diminishing returns
Limited impact

influences:		firm alignment and orientation
			posture
			governance
			internal conflict
			internal and external context
group conflict hinders adoption
actively fostering innovation
informal mechanisms
industry dynamics
gender diversity
Knowledge integration
Key actors

frameworks:	resource based view
			capabilities based perspective
industry convergence
Organizational innovation system

cases:			polaroid - misalignment
			xerox - failure to capitalize
			yahoo - failure to capitalize
			hospitality incumbents - dismissive of disruptors
			pharmaceutical companies - r&d failures lead to patent
acquisition resulting in depressed firm performance

limitations:		knowledge gaps
			outcome measurement
			Conceptual abstraction hinders implementation
			Difficulties in establishing causation between variables

 * All Sections
 * No unread replies.No replies.
 * Hi All,
 * 
 * I would like to make a correct on Individual Assignment 1: the tax bracket
 * for 35% should start with $231,251 (instead of $231,250).
 * 
 * I have updated the assignment sheet and the assignment page. Sorry about the
 * error!
 * 
 * Once again, Individual Assignment 1 is due on February 4. Please feel free to
 * reach out if you have any questions or need help with the assignment.

 * 
 * Purpose
 * Declare variables and constants and use them in a program.
 * Design a decision structure to evaluate different conditions and execute
 * different instructions accordingly.
 * Handle user input and show output/results properly.
 * Requirement
 * Please provide proper comments to document your code, including the
 * following:
 * Author’s name
 * Purpose of the program
 * In-line comments for the statements, including the variable/constant
 * declaration and initialization.
 * Please submit the .java file(s) that contains the program for solving the
 * following question.
 * Write a program that computes the income tax for an individual.
 * The program should ask the user to enter the amount of taxable income. If the
 * user enters a negative number, the program should show an error message and
 * end the program.
 * 
 * The program then uses the tax bracket (as shown below) to calculate the tax
 * amount:
 * 10% on taxable income from $0 to $11,000, plus
 * 12% on taxable income over $11,001 to $44,725, plus
 * 22% on taxable income over $44,726 to $95,375, plus
 * 24% on taxable income over $95,376 to $182,100, plus
 * 32% on taxable income over $182,101 to $231,250, plus
 * 35% on taxable income over $231,251 to $578,125, plus
 * 37% on taxable income over $578,126 or more
 * 
 * The program should display the total income and the total tax due.
 * 
 * Note: The income and tax amount should be rounded up to the next whole
 * number. You can use Math.ceil(number) to get the round-up number.
