Based on the superclass Staff (included in the lab files), please implement Manager class

The field level ranges between 1-5. If the value is not within the range, set the value to 1.
Getter and setter for the field should also be provided.
Please override the calcSalary() method. A managerâ€™s salary is calculated as regular salary plus a stipend. 
The stipend is $150 per level (e.g., $750 for a level 5 manager).
Please create an application class to test your Manager class.

Please submit the .java file (i.e., the source files).
