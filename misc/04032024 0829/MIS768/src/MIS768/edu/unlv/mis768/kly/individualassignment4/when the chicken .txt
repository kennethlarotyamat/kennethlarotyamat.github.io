when the chicken 
first crossed the road
he said to himself

this is a nice road 
i like this road.
and it is a road that

does not appear to be well 
travelled and it does not 
appear to have very much

traffic and so the chicken 
crossed the road in an
attempt to get to the other side

it went well for the chicken 
and the chicken was able to find 
whatever it is chickens eat.

chicken food 
perhaps
or maybe duck food.

whatever it was
i don't really know.
i wasn't actually there.
