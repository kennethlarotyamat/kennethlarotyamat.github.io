Module 3: IT-Enabled Innovation 

3.1: The Relation Between It And Organizational Innovation 
1: The Role Of It In Organizational Innovation
 
correlations: 	number of servers to firm performance
computing capacity to firm performance
storage capacity to firm performance
number of patents to it investments
it expertise and firm performance
patents filed to commercialized products // Commercialized
moderate competition stimulates innovation
intense competition depresses innovation

variables:		productivity 
sales performance 
profitability 
value added 
stock returns 
return on investment
Economies of scale
Architectural flexibility
Diminishing returns
Limited impact

influences:		firm alignment and orientation
			posture
			governance
			internal conflict
			internal and external context
group conflict hinders adoption
actively fostering innovation
informal mechanisms
industry dynamics
gender diversity
Knowledge integration
Key actors

frameworks:	resource based view
			capabilities based perspective
industry convergence
Organizational innovation system

cases:			polaroid - misalignment
			xerox - failure to capitalize
			yahoo - failure to capitalize
			hospitality incumbents - dismissive of disruptors
			pharmaceutical companies - r&d failures lead to patent
acquisition resulting in depressed firm performance

limitations:		knowledge gaps
			outcome measurement
			Conceptual abstraction hinders implementation
			Difficulties in establishing causation between variables
			
2: The Nonlinear Influence Of Harmonious Information Technology 


Frameworks: 	HITA - Harmonious IT affordance
			linear vs Non-linear & quadratic correlations
Affordances not inherent in people or artifacts, but
 organizational relationships
Distinctions between Affordances  & impediments 
Resonance - HITA alignment preserves organizational 
memory 
Organizational inertia - delays in implementation
Adaptation
Paradox - tensions between interdependent elements
Exploratory innovation
Exploitative Innovation


limitations:		Few studies use non-linear frameworks
			Most studies assume linear relationships


Variables:		IT Affordance
			IT appropriation


Guidance:		Promote = positive hita or impede = negative HITA
				Either situation can be leveraged to produce innovation
And innovative solutions
			Managing tensions to promote innovations
			Finding and leveraging existing paradoxes to stimulate
innovation - converting tensions into synergies

Examples:		New Collaborations tools that don’t integrate well with 
Existing Organizational memory tools, reducing HITA
Counter-intuitive - when innovation increases despite increasing
organizational misalignment

Perspectives:	IT Affordance misalignment may prevent standardization 
or an effort toward homogeneity and uniformity - or it may be perceived in this manner - but it is exactly this misalignment that results in novel solutions as disparate structures attempt to integrate with one another.
			It’s the challenges created by dissonance, and the need to resolve 
that dissonance - the conflicts created by that dissonance - that results in innovation, and innovate solutions
Definitions:	Positive HITA is when an organization is operating synergistically
			Negative HITA is when an organization is operating with creative
 Dissonance, or, displays paradoxical characteristics
The quadratic relationship between innovation and HITA is that 
innovation is increases as synergies increase, but also as dissonance increases
			Paradox refers to conflict within an organization, or
misalignment within an organization, or dissonance within an organization - even though it may be paradoxical
That innovation can increase as dissonance increases, paradox is not used to describe this phenomenon, the term counter-intuitive is used in this circumstance
			Coalignment - in contrast to dissonance - a kind of synergy
			Affordance Theory - what information technology allows human
users to do - affordance can increase as an operator becomes more adept at using a particular artifact of information technology - affordance is also - it affordance also depends on the goals of the user. - a crm doesn’t do much for a person interested in programming - an IDE doesn’t do much for a person looking to close a deal.
			Types of IT Affordance - Collaborative Affordance - 
organizational Memory Affordance - process management affordance
			Affordance - what is allowed - what is enabled
			Organizational inertia - describes the difficulties an 
organization may have in changing course or changing direction - in HITA terms - HITA = Zero
			Orthogonal - do not influence one another, either in a positive 
way or a negative way

3: Strategic Relevance Of Organizational Virtues Enabled By IT

Terminology:	COPs - communities of practice - a conceptual framework for
Organizations.
Concepts:		Improvisation as innovation - improvisation involves developing
				novel solutions to address novel situations - and should be 
				considered a form of innovation - and should be fostered
				or promoted by an organization to address urgent and
				unpredictable, and unanticipated challenges
			Organizational Wisdom - required to improvise successfully - has
				a positive effect on the ability to improvise
			Mediating Variables - Mediating Factors - IT affordance doesn’t 
				have a direct connection to innovation - it’s mediated 
				through virtues and capabilities that can foster or hinder 
				Innovation.
			IT Capabilities are distinct from IT affordances - capabilities refer 
				to what can be done - affordances, specifically the aspect of 
				how technology is appropriated for a purpose - how 
				technologies might be used - a GPU could be used for 
				enhancing a computer game - or processing a large 
				language model - or processing a blockchain or 
				cryptocurrency - a GPU is capable of performing 
				calculations, but what functions a GPU affords to the user 
				depends on how the user appropriates or uses the GPU or
				what application the user uses it for.

Virtues:		Courage
			Justice - distributive and corrective
			Wisdom
			Temperance - particularly relevant during periods of radical 
				organizational change - needed to reduce anxiety, panic, 
				And Despair that coincides with radical organizational 
				change - Organizational Temperance serves to prevent or 
				reduce chaos

Frameworks:	The framework for organizational virtues is an extension of the 
				business ethics
			Organizational IT affordances - collaborative, process 
				management, and memory - Which in turn enable
				Organizational Virtues - These organizational virtues 
				determine the success of organizational improvisation - 
				improvisation is either a form of innovation - or a kind of 
				process that occurs before innovation - or is a kind of 
				preliminary step to innovation.

Catalysts:		improvisation - turbulent circumstances - spontaneous situations - unprecedented 
				Circumstances - truncated time horizons
Innovation - enhanced by formalizing the process of improvisation - or establishing or 
	practicing improvisation - having a process in place specifically for developing 
	novel solutions to unprecedented situations


Limitations:		ninety percent of innovations fail
Research showing reduced significance of information technology on organizational 
Outcomes
Organizational Wisdom - highest correlative variable to improvisational success - may 
potentially be highest among more established incumbent organizations - and less 
so among more recently established organizations.
In Business Ethics research, the virtue based ethical framework occupies a niche area, even 
within the information systems discipline - business ethics, the majority of business 
ethics scholarship - focuses on morality (“deontology”) or optimization as an 
ethical framework (“utilitarianism”)
Research based on subjects or observees or participants based in the united states


4: Information Technology And Organizational Innovation: 
Challenges:	Inconsistencies in literature
			Limitations on areas of study - Organizational courage - risk tolerance - risk aversion - and fit
			Limitations of agency in a corporate context
Concepts:		Fit -HITA, and how HITA influences organizational courage
			Gestalt - coherence of internal structures
			Stratification of Fit: proposes 3 levels of fit Level 1 - Level 2 - Level 3
			Actualization - application and implementation
			Innovation - 2 types - exploratory - exploitative - exploitative meaning commercializable - actually - it seems both 
				exploratory and exploitative are for commercial applications - exploratory refers to innovating new 
				products - exploitative refers to innovating existing products - exploratory innovation is radical - 
				Exploitative is Incremental. Exploratory innovation is more disruptive.
			Actualizing affordances - Requires experimentation, changes, tinkering - these processes can pose a perceived risk 
				that a less courageous organization may be averse to, and therefore will never benefit from affordances 
				that are never implemented or actualized.
			Moderation - one variable has an effect on another variable, but that intensity of that impact is affected by a
				third variable
			Mediation -  one variable has an effect on another variable, but this effect can only occur through an 
				intermediate variable, or intermediary, that transmits the effect from the first variable, to the second 
				Variable
			Profile deviation - expectations vs reality
			Matching - two variables
			Covariance
			Gestalt
			
			
Frameworks:	Agility -  the ability to adapt to changing circumstances
Terminology:	Organizational Courage - refers to the ability to take risks - 
			Fit - Alignment and harmony - FIT & HITA refer to the convergence of IT infrastructure and organizational
				objectives in a way that serves as a catalyst for innovation - fosters innovation
			Circumspect - risk averse - risk avoidance - wary or risk
			Transitive Effect - 
			Salience = prevalence -
			Parsimonious - used in this context to mean focused
			Spurious - dubious or contrived

Conflicts:		Exploratory innovation by a firm may create products that conflict with existing product lines the following are 
			a list of companies that innovated products that conflicted with existing products:
				Vanguard - passively managed index funds
				State Street - Exchange traded funds
				Xerox - GUI, Personal Computers
				Polaroid - Digital Cameras, digital photography, digital imaging
				Alphabet - Large Language Models
				Booking holdings - Vacation Rentals
				IBM - Personal Computers , Servers
				Altria - vape products
				Microsoft - Mobile Operating Systems, Mobile Devices
				Corteva - Bioengineered crops
				Blockbuster - video streaming services
				Palm, blackberry, motorola - touchscreen smartphones
				DR Horton, Lennar Greystone - Modular construction techniques
				Atari - console gaming - computer gaming - multiplayer gaming
Reflections:	Affordances must be actualized, having the best tools, having the best technology means nothing if it isn’t put
				into use, it’s useless if it isn’t used - and it’s useless if it isn’t used to produce anything, like to innovate new 
				products, or iterate and improve upon existing products. These new innovations have the potential to create 
				uncertainty and perceived risks to an organization, and an organization must have courage to overcome				 the fears of risk and uncertainty to actualize technology to innovate.
			What the data shows is that the rewards are there for organizations  willing to take risks, for organizations that
				have The organizational courage to take prudent and well calculated risks and address the uncertainties 
				that come with those, rewards, those innovations, however, in order for these rewards to materialize for an
				Organization, information Technology affordances must be actualized in combination with a strong 
				culture of organizational courage.

1: Artificial Intelligence In Organizations 
2: AI Innovation Typology
3: Artificial Intelligence (AI): Multidisciplinary Perspectives 




3.3.3.1 Leveraging large language models for predictive chemistry


Terminology:	Machine Learning
			Large Language Model
			LLM Training
			In context learning - this refers to how the LLM learns about a subject during the course 
                                       		of a chat session, rather than fine-tuning or training the model directly.		
			Inverse design - this refers to creating molecular structures - or chemicals - polymers or 
alloys - that react in a certain way, or have a specific set of properties - I think that it 
is called inverse design because, rather than creating a chemical, and describing its 
properties, - the desired properties are described, and then the molecule is designed
			Generative Models
			MLM - Machine Learning Model
			LLM - Large Language Model
			First-principles theory
                          Isomers - This is chemistry related
Polymers- This is chemistry related
Monomers - This is chemistry related
		Gaussian process regression - GPR
		Generative pretrained transformer - gpt

Applications:	Large Language Models and machine learning to chemistry, and physical sciences
			Computing, programming, AI, ML, LLM on Physical sciences, chemistry, and predictive
				Simulations
			Generating a specific type of dispersant - which I think is a kind of soap - generating a 
dispersant with a specific set of characteristics

Limitations:		The LLM was able to generate molecules using inverse design, or, it was able to 
Hypothesize the existence of chemicals with a desired set of characteristics,
But there were instances where the LLM generated invalid chemical structures
Even if an LLM is able to generate a new chemical, that chemical still has to be synthesized
	And there are instances where it’s not really possible or practical to synthesize the
	Chemical generated by the LLM
It can be difficult to train an LLM accurately, or train it well for accuracy because very 
large dataset are required, and there are limitations on how many chemicals can be 
tested and added to a given data set to train an LLM on

Variations:		Using a general LLM AI tool (GPT 3) trained on chemistry documents Rather than a 
chemistry specific AI tool, or existing chemistry simulation tools conventional machine learning models designed for chemistry
Existing machine learning models represent chemicals or molecular structures 
	mathematically, or symbolically, or as a kind of code or program that reacts  	
a certain way, rather than verbally. Existing machine learning models simulate 
molecular structures in an abstract way, rather than verbally, the approach used in 
this paper, by these researchers, describes chemicals verbally
The GPT 3 LLM was compared with a gaussian process regression mlm

Reflections:	this was a really interesting article - one of the things that I’m wondering is: if copyright 
protection isn’t or cannot be granted to ai generated text or ai generated artwork, will patents also not be granted to ai generated chemicals? Or AI generated medicines or Pharmaceuticals? Or ai generated chemical compounds.
AI is already used to create novel chemical structures, however, the prevailing AI tools 
used for the purpose of generating novel chemical structures are Machine learning 
models, rather than large language models, this research paper approaches 
generating novel chemical structures using LLMs rather than MLMs


Intersections:	This paper illustrates the concept of IT Affordances - LLMs have certain capabilities, and 
how LLMs are appropriated, in this case, an LLM is appropriated for the purpose of creating novel chemical compounds - this article illustrates a novel appropriation of an existing tool.
