Annotations


It was by pure chance that I took module 3 to work on, or it wasn’t pure chance, but it wasn’t exactly a deliberate decision.


It was more that it was due module 3 is due way off in april, it was the assignment that was due later on.


So I didn’t end up working on the references page first. I actually started with the outline


I have to put this aside for now and work on my MIS 768 Assignments
