Kenneth Larot Yamat</div><div>[and this is something of a headache for me right now] @KennethLYamat</div><div><br></div><div>5</div><div><br></div><div>What do I have to do today?</div><div><br></div><div>I have to try to get as much of my&nbsp;</div><div>coursework done today as I can because&nbsp;</div><div>I really need to work as much as I can&nbsp;</div><div>during the weekend. Friday - Sunday.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm not totally strapped for&nbsp;</div><div>cash,&nbsp; but I'm almost totally&nbsp;</div><div>strapped for cash.</div><div><br></div><div>6</div><div><br></div><div>how can I say</div><div>anything but&nbsp;</div><div>good things</div><div>about you</div><div><br></div><div>really I have nothing</div><div>but really good things</div><div>to say about you and I</div><div>will say nothing but</div><div><br></div><div>good things about who</div><div>you are and how you were</div><div>to me. even if.</div><div><br></div><div>7</div><div><br></div><div>but for both of my blogs, both of my websites.</div><div>I think that I'm going to clear out anything&nbsp;</div><div>that isn't poetry, this new style of poetry</div><div>that I am working with. Things like this. like</div><div>introspections and all that, are things that I&nbsp;</div><div>will write primarily here on GitHub, rather than</div><div>on Blogger, or. I think that I will write them</div><div>here before publicly publishing them on Blogger.</div><div><br></div><div>8</div><div><br></div><div>I was on campus yesterday. I had class, but the class&nbsp;</div><div>was held remotely. The campus has serious cell data&nbsp;</div><div>coverage shadows, and, I had trouble connecting. It's&nbsp;</div><div>not like I have passwords that are easy to remember,&nbsp;</div><div>and I definitely don't use passwords, the same passwords&nbsp;</div><div>for multiple accounts, so, I often I have to use an alternate&nbsp;</div><div>authentication method to sign in, but if I'm in a serious&nbsp;</div><div>coverage shadow, logging in becomes impossible, so, I&nbsp;</div><div>basically couldn't log in, and I basically couldn't work&nbsp;</div><div>on anything while I was on campus.</div><div><br></div><div>9</div><div><br></div><div>I still have to do some work. Money work right now, well</div><div>not right now, not this minute, I just finished, but I</div><div>have to work later today. this is such a nightmare. A&nbsp;</div><div>real nightmare.</div><div><br></div><div>10</div><div><br></div><div>I really don't think that filing a software copyright is</div><div>enough. I really want to file a software patent. I really do.</div><div>Such a nightmare! MIS 768. I think that I'm failing. She</div><div>hasn't graded several of my assignments, and I haven't really</div><div>formally audited the course yet, thinking that I might still&nbsp;</div><div>have a chance at a C. I would take a C in the course and move</div><div>one, but, it's still up in the air until I get a grade, but.</div><div>on March 29th I have to make a decision, and, when it all&nbsp;</div><div>comes down to it, I can't risk getting anything less than a C,</div><div>so I do kind of have to Audit the course.</div><div><br></div><div>11</div><div><br></div><div>[there were a few challenges that were really insurmountable] Â· [and]</div><div>1h [I think that in a lot of ways I simply was not able to overcome them]</div><div>Okay: Twitter Blue or Twitter for Professionals?

The campus is definitely not in a&nbsp;</div><div>rural area, my neighborhood isn't a rural area. I think&nbsp;</div><div>that I often get better connections in rural areas than&nbsp;</div><div>I do here.</div><div><br></div><div>Back at home, I think I'll do some homework for a few hours,&nbsp;</div><div>but this means I might have to extend my door dashing past&nbsp;</div><div>midnight starting later means ending later, that's just&nbsp;</div><div>kind of the way it goes.</div><div><br></div><div>14</div><div><br></div><div>Change&nbsp;</div><div>in my pocket</div><div><br></div><div>from looking at</div><div>the floor&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>looking at the floor</div><div>to see if there are any</div><div><br></div><div>pennies on the floor</div><div>any change on the floor.</div><div><br></div><div>15</div><div><br></div><div>I'm still quite a bit * frustrated with&nbsp;</div><div>the way * everything is going * right</div><div>now.

I don't&nbsp;</div><div>know what it is. The whole time I've been in Las Vegas I've&nbsp;</div><div>been experiencing stress and fatigue. I really don't know&nbsp;</div><div>what's causing this. I've tried to make changes like drinking&nbsp;</div><div>more water, and I've noticed a slight improvement, but, a very&nbsp;</div><div>very slight improvement. I've been drinking slightly less soda,&nbsp;</div><div>but still quite a bit of it. I don't know what else to do.</div><div><br></div><div>29</div><div><br></div><div>As far as taking any road-trips goes, I haven't really planned&nbsp;</div><div>anything or made any definite commitments to go on one.

I changed a&nbsp;</div><div>few of the titles on the Sanford Street series, just a few posts&nbsp;</div><div>where the title was [NUMBER] Sanford Street to Letters from Sanford&nbsp;</div><div>Street # [NUMBER]. I've been meaning to do all of them, but it&nbsp;</div><div>honestly really doesn't matter.

I have something in mind, but I haven't said&nbsp;</div><div>anything about it, any details!</div><div><br></div><div>I was reading, in a Thomson Reuters newsletter, about&nbsp;</div><div>a desalination plant in California that was blocked by&nbsp;</div><div>environmentalists, and one things that the environmental&nbsp;</div><div>group pointed out is that, water recycling is much less&nbsp;</div><div>expensive, less energy intensive, and less destructive to&nbsp;</div><div>marine life. and, even if the desalination plant is stopped,&nbsp;</div><div>i'm sure that it can be retooled as a water purification&nbsp;</div><div>plant anyway. or something. i don't think of myself as an&nbsp;</div><div>environmentalist, i just happen to find the argument that&nbsp;</div><div>they made compelling.</div><div><br></div><div>What else? nothing else for right now. I'm at my apartment,&nbsp;</div><div>enjoying Bushmills, the rest of the bottle. I kind of want&nbsp;</div><div>to play a computer game.</div><div><br></div><div>I think that everything that I need to get done, is done.&nbsp;</div><div>so. I'll goof off for what's left of the day.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm getting together my college application. This is the&nbsp;</div><div>third fucking time I've done this. UNLV, UMKC, and now UTA.&nbsp;</div><div>I have to go.</div><div><br></div><div>What's one challenge that I'm facing? Well, I hardly&nbsp;</div><div>know anyone out here. I don't want to get in contact&nbsp;</div><div>with anyone from before Arlington.</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe I can ask the land lady for a letter of recommendation.</div><div>I just don't know. This is a nightmare. I don't know anyone.</div><div><br></div><div>70</div><div><br></div><div>There were a number of things that I did. I changed.</div><div>I did a few things. I did my logged my miles for my&nbsp;</div><div>business. I really need to get together all my expenses</div><div>as well. This isn't easy.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm sure that I'll need a letter of recommendation.&nbsp;</div><div>I don't. fucking. know anyone. I haven't made any&nbsp;</div><div>friends or connections. maybe my land lady can write one.</div><div><br></div><div>One problem. Is. Running out of money before I get this&nbsp;</div><div>started, or before I can get student loans. The general&nbsp;</div><div>consensus is that going to graduate school is less prudent&nbsp;</div><div>than going to a trade school or vocational school, but I&nbsp;</div><div>definitely can't seem to get into a vocational school. I&nbsp;</div><div>tried 3 times and I just couldn't do it. I have no idea&nbsp;</div><div>what the fuck to do. This is a nightmare. A real nightmare.</div><div><br></div><div>71</div><div><br></div><div>Thinking about the issues that I've faced in the past. I think.&nbsp;</div><div>I had an opportunity to go to UMKC, there was a position at the&nbsp;</div><div>Post Office in Kansas City, that I declined, because it would have&nbsp;</div><div>been less, in total, than what I was making working at the Tractor&nbsp;</div><div>Warehouse and the Hotel.</div><div><br></div><div>I logged my miles. I need to figure out my expenses as well. The</div><div>thing is that, there are certain expenses that are accounted for&nbsp;</div><div>in the logging of milage, and some that are not. some expenses. and</div><div>some expenses have different kinds of treatments.</div><div><br></div><div>but I remember thinking, that, maybe not going to UNLV or UMKC worked&nbsp;</div><div>out for the best. The COVID-19 Pandemic hit, and, had I attended either&nbsp;</div><div>UMKC or UNLV, it just wouldn't have worked out, or, it would have been&nbsp;</div><div>disrupted in a major way.</div><div><br></div><div>With expectations of a recession, it might make sense for me to go to&nbsp;</div><div>college now, this might be the. I don't want to think that this will be&nbsp;</div><div>the last time that I do this.

I doubt that I will have my claim approved,&nbsp;</div><div>but it's. I think that it's important to file for unemployment, considering that&nbsp;</div><div>I'm unemployed, um, because I think it's important to be part of the headcount of&nbsp;</div><div>people who are not working, but looking for work. This is a nightmare, because, it&nbsp;</div><div>feels like it just adds hassle to my day. I think of filing unemployment as similar&nbsp;</div><div>to participating in the census. I guess. Maybe, filing for unemployment is kind of&nbsp;</div><div>a waste of time, considering that I'm unlikely to get benefits, but, the maybe the&nbsp;</div><div>same could be said about the census.</div><div><br></div><div>73</div><div><br></div><div>When it comes to dating. it seems that there is a kind of testing stage,&nbsp;</div><div>with a subsequent authentication stage.</div><div>I don't know what to do. as far as work goes.

I work nights, so I still have&nbsp;</div><div>several hours before I have to go in. I read emails, I'm doing laundry&nbsp;</div><div>right now. is there anything else I can really do?</div><div><br></div><div>Today is the last day of the weekend.</div><div>Looking back at this mini road trip. I really wish I had taken more&nbsp;</div><div>pictures of Ely, NV. The part of the town that isn't totally brand&nbsp;</div><div>new has a really distinct look to it.</div><div><br></div><div>92</div><div><br></div><div>I went on a road trip. A super tiny one, much less ambitious than I had&nbsp;</div><div>originally planned, but it still felt longer than I wanted, and yet, I&nbsp;</div><div>also spent so much time on the road that it isn't clear to me why I didn't&nbsp;</div><div>reach my goal.</div><div><br></div><div>My original goal was Las Vegas, NV to Elko, NV to Salt Lake City, UT to&nbsp;</div><div>Saint George, UT to Las Vegas, NV, but that didn't happen.</div><div><br></div><div>Early on in the trip I changed my goal from Elko to West Wendover, NV,&nbsp;</div><div>figuring it would be a shorter trip between West Wendover to Salt Lake&nbsp;</div><div>City, and also figuring that I might see the Mormon Crickets in West&nbsp;</div><div>Wendover anyway.</div><div><br></div><div>Didn't happen. I got tired around Ely, NV, and then figured that's enough.&nbsp;</div><div>I spent maybe 14 hours on the road. So yeah, that's really enough driving for me.</div><div><br></div><div>A few days ago I came across old posts from road trips that I had taken in&nbsp;</div><div>the past, and I realized that so many of them coincided with difficult times&nbsp;</div><div>in my life, and I kind of wondered if maybe difficult times in my life present&nbsp;</div><div>themselves because I need to get out of the house or something, and also&nbsp;</div><div>remembering that I almost went on a road trip the other day out of frustration.</div><div><br></div><div>Like, maybe the Universe itself is telling me I can't stay in bed and sleep all&nbsp;</div><div>day, or play computer games.</div><div><br></div><div>I figured I'd go on a road trip without the Universe forcing me to do so.</div><div><br></div><div>The other kind of motivating factor was that I saw an overtime sign up. I&nbsp;</div><div>missed it, obviously, otherwise I wouldn't have gone on a road trip, but it&nbsp;</div><div>made me somewhat optimistic that I could go on a road trip without the cost&nbsp;</div><div>of doing so effecting the deadline I'd set for myself to pay off my credit cards.</div><div><br></div><div>I recently transferred to a new work location, and I wasn't really expecting&nbsp;</div><div>overtime to be a thing at this new location.</div><div><br></div><div>93</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, so I'm back home now, I did not see any Mormon Crickets.&nbsp;</div><div>NOT A SINGLE MORMON CRICKET!

For MIS 768.</div><div>There are a bunch of things that I really need to get done. what a nightmare. I came across something I find kind of annoying.</div><div><br></div><div>Nightmare. I'm tired. an old friend asked me to hang out tonight. we met up. and went to 7-11. waste of time. i think that she was happy&nbsp;</div><div>to see me, and i was happy to see her, but i have all this other shit that i have to take care of. even though i'm not working now, and it&nbsp;</div><div>will be a while before i go back to work.</div><div><br></div><div>17m and the annoying thing is that there is a social media influencer using the name chestnut &amp; hazel as a page. annoying. #vladimirputin!</div><div>I fought for the Allies at Stalingrad as part of the Fried Rice Auxiliaries of the Red Army, Ho Chi Minh and Emiliano Zapata were my Comrades&nbsp;</div><div>in Arms, but the Soviets had logistical problems then, as now, and we were given only one rifle for the three of us. 22h</div><div><br></div><div>I remember when I set up Prospectus Media Group, I guess I would later come across a company that claimed to be using that name for a while,&nbsp;</div><div>so I just stopped using it, but at this point, Chestnut + Hazel is a real business. so. #vladimirputin Kenneth Larot Yamat @KennethLYamat</div><div><br></div><div>131</div><div><br></div><div>think of how the things</div><div>that you've seen are now</div><div>different from what was</div><div>originally there</div><div>and now how what is currently</div><div>here is different from what was</div><div>previously here and what</div><div>was originally here and what</div><div>could be a new thing and what</div><div>can be the next thing that</div><div>is here and what there are</div><div>everywhere</div><div>and what there are when there</div><div>are things that you think that</div><div>are meant to be seen and what</div><div>are things that are meant to&nbsp;</div><div>be discovered</div><div><br></div><div>but i don't really know if i really want to deal with ONEQ. There is really a&nbsp;</div><div>whole lot of bull shit on a lot of these total market index funds, and i really&nbsp;</div><div>don't want to deal with a lot of them. stupid. stupid. I know. there's just a&nbsp;</div><div>lot of shitty ones on the index. zombie ticker symbols on the index. some of&nbsp;</div><div>them never fall off the index. well. i don't know. a lot of them are garbage.</div><div><br></div><div>I did manage to take care of a few things with my old. With my 401(k). and that&nbsp;</div><div>was kind of nice. I don't know. what else to do. there were a few student loan,&nbsp;</div><div>student aid, and student grant related stuff for school. I don't recall. exactly&nbsp;</div><div>what the deadline is for the application period. I want to say that it is.</div><div><br></div><div>132</div><div><br></div><div>I don't remember what was originally here</div><div>but whatever it was, I guess it must have been</div><div>interesting. There were a lot of pictures and</div><div>screenshots of this or that. I don't know what</div><div>to do with all of these photographs I'm amassing.</div><div><br></div><div>I took of all of the photographs, and saved them.</div><div>but I don't know what to do eventually. Where</div><div>to put them or post them. @KennethLYamat</div><div><br></div><div>I'll often think about things</div><div>that I really don't want to remember</div><div>and how everything is a headache</div><div>and everything is a pain in the neck</div><div>and how things sometimes get nicer</div><div>and things sometimes get worse.</div><div><br></div><div>If Vladimir Putin thinks he's going to win:&nbsp;</div><div>he's got another thing coming! 23h</div><div>Kenneth Larot Yamat. what I really want most of the</div><div>time is independence and autonomy. like. the ability</div><div>to do, what I want to do.</div><div>Do you approve of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor?</div><div><br></div><div>I'll often think about things</div><div>that I really don't want to remember</div><div>and how everything is a headache</div><div>and everything is a pain in the neck</div><div>and how things sometimes get nicer</div><div>and things sometimes get worse.</div><div><br></div><div>the blades of the fan</div><div>move around in a circular</div><div>motion.

I figured that I had a bunch of outgoing&nbsp;</div><div>payments and transfers since I usually schedule&nbsp;</div><div>outgoing payments or transfers on a payday, and&nbsp;</div><div>that it was simply due to that, and I really didn't&nbsp;</div><div>look into it any further.</div><div><br></div><div>The other reason no alarm bells went off in my mind&nbsp;</div><div>is because the transaction that was processed twice&nbsp;</div><div>was approximately the same amount as a few transfers&nbsp;</div><div>and payments that I was sure were going to process&nbsp;</div><div>around that time that I made, so I really just thought&nbsp;</div><div>that it was the payments and transfers that I made.</div><div><br></div><div>I was nevertheless stressed out because I started to feel&nbsp;</div><div>that maybe I didn't really plan correctly. or something.&nbsp;</div><div>Anyway, I saw a prompt by Chase about the double transaction&nbsp;</div><div>glitch, and, what do you know, it turns out that I was a victim&nbsp;</div><div>of the Chase Double Payment Processing glitch.</div><div><br></div><div>136</div><div><br></div><div>in so many ways. things are. where they. would have been.</div><div>and when the sidewalk turns into a streen and turns into pavement.</div><div><br></div><div>09 12 15 22 05 08 05 18 01 19 19 09 23 71 83 10 03 39 10</div><div><br></div><div>09 06 21 03 11 05 04 21 16 20 15 04 01 25 15 26 23 32 12</div><div><br></div><div>07 15 04 19 01 22 05 13 05 48 78 95 65 15 45 01 05 09 65&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>05 18 25 14 18 33 20 18 42 15 18 81 10 19 13 95 65 65 45</div><div><br></div><div>08 09 20 20 09 14 07 01 14 01 12 12 20 09 13 05 12 15 23</div><div><br></div><div>half of all. the oranges in the bin. have been changed for the better.</div><div>they have been changed into orange juice and juiced and all of that YEAH!</div><div><br></div><div>137</div><div><br></div><div>I still haven't&nbsp;</div><div>fallen asleep and I still</div><div>have not. fallen. asleep.</div><div>at all and I have not.</div><div>fallen asleep.</div><div><br></div><div>I think I came home</div><div>at around eleven-thirty</div><div>at night, and right now it</div><div>is almost five-thirty</div><div>and, well.

I'm writing this update on 10/11/2022 at 07:03 PM&nbsp;</div><div>from North Las Vegas, Nevada. I think that I wrote this post a while ago when I&nbsp;</div><div>was living in Arlington, Texas. I deleted as much of the. I deleted anything related.</div><div><br></div><div>I don't evenw</div><div>want to remember some&nbsp;</div><div>of the things.</div><div>that I often come across</div><div>here and read!</div><div><br></div><div>There just aren't as many distractions in my life as there used to be, and I don't know&nbsp;</div><div>if this is a good thing, or something to be sad about. I really don't browse dating apps&nbsp;</div><div>or social media apps. I still watch YouTube videos and documentaries that aren't entirely&nbsp;</div><div>useful, but that I find entertaining or interesting. I've even removed the quick start&nbsp;</div><div>buttons for computer games from the task bar on my computer. I have less than 1 month&nbsp;</div><div>to be ready for my for my entrance exam for the Academy.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>158</div><div><br></div><div>I was thinking about buying an energy drink right now, but I remember the last time I did&nbsp;</div><div>this, and it did not go well, so, I decided not to get an energy drink.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I'm trying to think. I'm doing a small amount of day and swing trading, just 5 shares at a&nbsp;</div><div>time, and I've been able to enter and exit 3 out of 4 of the ticker symbols I'm working with,&nbsp;</div><div>but on the 4 one, I'm slowly starting to accumulate a position, but my thinking is that, I'll&nbsp;</div><div>eventually be able to exit, or, I'll accumulate a full 100 shares, and attempt to exit via&nbsp;</div><div>writing covered call options.</div><div><br></div><div>I had Thursday off, and slept the whole day, I didn't go out to eat, but I thought about it,&nbsp;</div><div>and then decided against it. It wasn't because I didn't want to spend the money, it was&nbsp;</div><div>because it was late at night, and I really wasn't sure what would be open, or, what I would&nbsp;</div><div>or wouldn't feel like eating.</div><div><br></div><div>I bought new pants. 17 pairs, which I think is kind of a lot of pants. I bought cardboard boxes&nbsp;</div><div>too, the kind that resemble plastic filing totes with lids, it probably would have been slightly&nbsp;</div><div>cheaper to buy plastic totes.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, I'm not using them to file documents or anything. My goal is to organize things that I&nbsp;</div><div>keep in my closet.</div><div><br></div><div>Applications for Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, Portfolio Management, and Equity Index Development</div><div>Create an equity index of publicly traded companies based on hita, different companies.&nbsp; A&nbsp;</div><div>list of companies will be assigned. Each assigned a HITA level. This will inform. The HITA&nbsp;</div><div>equity Index will inform the M&amp;A approach.</div><div><br></div><div>the bottle</div><div>of orange juice</div><div>made it back</div><div><br></div><div>home alive because</div><div>I did not drink it</div><div>while it was travelling with</div><div>me. good thing too!</div><div><br></div><div>turns out the orange juice</div><div>was actually tangerine soda!</div><div><br></div><div>We can call it the&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Chatterjee 500 HITA Equity Index,&nbsp;</div><div>but we might not be able to use the number 500,&nbsp;</div><div>so it can actually be any number.</div><div><br></div><div>We might not be able to use numbers like</div><div><br></div><div>500 - S&amp;P 500</div><div>30 - Dow 30, dow jones industrial average</div><div>3000 - Russell 3000</div><div>5000 - WIlshire 5000</div><div>100 - NASDAQ 100, the nasdaq</div><div><br></div><div>Well, maybe not because there is a NASDAQ 100 and an&nbsp;</div><div>S&amp;P 100. So we might be able to use 500.</div><div><br></div><div>159</div><div><br></div><div>how can you</div><div>say such horrible things</div><div>when the things you</div><div>say are so well said?</div><div><br></div><div>how can it be that the oranges</div><div>turned into tangerines</div><div>while I wasn't looking?</div><div><br></div><div>I think that it is nothing less</div><div>than: pure. MAGIC!</div><div><br></div><div>I got an oil change for my car. It seemed like a long stretch since&nbsp;</div><div>my last oil change, but full synthetic oil changes are only needed&nbsp;</div><div>every 8000 miles, so I was actually right on time. My last oil change&nbsp;</div><div>was at 20700 and this one was at 28060.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Well. I don't know</div><div>right now it feels like.</div><div>Programming. is just one</div><div>of those things that I have</div><div>to file away now. Like.</div><div>Bronze Working!</div><div>hahahaha. I don't know.</div><div>whatever I guess.</div><div><br></div><div>I got an oil change for my car, I would have had my tires changed too,&nbsp;</div><div>but they seem to have plenty of tread, so, I'm really not going to waste&nbsp;</div><div>the money. Even though I'm kind of a cheapskate, or, maybe I've become&nbsp;</div><div>kind of a cheapskate, one thing that I've been spending too much money&nbsp;</div><div>on is food. For now, I won't worry too much about it, but I will keep&nbsp;</div><div>in mind not to spend too much money on food.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I finally got my project to upload an image. Small victories. Here is one&nbsp;</div><div>thing that I've noticed: it's possible to set the dimensions of a canvas&nbsp;</div><div>in CSS or HTML. For some reason I decided to set the dimensions in HTML,&nbsp;</div><div>and when I uploaded the image, the canvas stretched to fit the image,&nbsp;</div><div>when the dimensions of the canvas are set in CSS, it seems the image is&nbsp;</div><div>stretched to fit the canvas. Most of the other student projects that I'm&nbsp;</div><div>taking guidance from set the dimensions of the canvas in CSS, but I think&nbsp;</div><div>I'm going to keep the canvas dimensions set in HTML because I prefer that&nbsp;</div><div>the image retain its, I guess, dimensional integrity.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>160</div><div><br></div><div>Right now, for food, I'll just stick to the 7-Eleven grill items. Fast&nbsp;</div><div>food, buffet food, and restaurants will cost too much&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I was able to get the Reset Image button to work. Second small victory.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>you are too damn fine so for the good of myself and for the good of mankind&nbsp;</div><div>i'm going to eat your i'm going to i'm going to eat your you know well yeah&nbsp;</div><div>that's what i'm going to do&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I few days ago I received a marketing email from the company that she works&nbsp;</div><div>for, and it kind of irritated me more than I thought that it would. I requested&nbsp;</div><div>to be removed from the emailing list a while ago, and I also tried to delete my&nbsp;</div><div>account with her company, but, it didn't seem like that option was easily&nbsp;</div><div>available. I don't know how I really feel about that whole thing. I don't&nbsp;</div><div>know if it's something I want to forget, or something that I just don't want&nbsp;</div><div>to think about.</div><div><br></div><div>161</div><div><br></div><div>chickens are the start of where chicken sandwiches begin.</div><div>if you start off as a chicken sandwich, you will become</div><div>a chicken hamburger after a while, you can start off as</div><div>a chicken tender, or even a nugget of chicken. would you</div><div>like a nugget of wisdom? or would you prefer a nugget of</div><div>chicken?</div><div><br></div><div>901 E Division St</div><div>at QuikTrip</div><div>Arlington, TX 76011-7333</div><div>United States</div><div><br></div><div>oh, that is true. of the civilizations of antiquity, i love the romans the best,&nbsp;</div><div>but the egyptians were fucking amazing. the invented perfume. but the romans invented&nbsp;</div><div>plumbing so, this is a tough one.</div><div><br></div><div>you know, distilled alcohol was originally made by the egyptians to enhance perfume,&nbsp;</div><div>or i guess incense or whatever, but the europeans tried to drink it, and went blind</div><div><br></div><div>i think that is the story</div><div>Jorbalia # 241 by Kenneth Larot Yamat</div><div><br></div><div>Jorbalia 67 by Kenneth Larot Yamat</div><div>i ate here earlier today. i applied&nbsp;</div><div>here for work, but they never seem to&nbsp;</div><div>have any openings. it's a small place&nbsp;</div><div>anyway, staff-wise. they have steamed&nbsp;</div><div>or fried mushrooms, which i really liked.</div><div><br></div><div>i ate here earlier today. i applied here&nbsp;</div><div>for work, but they never seem to have any&nbsp;</div><div>openings. it's a small place anyway, staff-wise.&nbsp;</div><div>they have steamed or fried mushrooms, which i&nbsp;</div><div>really liked.</div><div><br></div><div>how so many things change where the ages are&nbsp;</div><div>and where the places</div><div>are and</div><div><br></div><div>where the highest places of the</div><div>mountains where we shout</div><div>and scream about</div><div><br></div><div>how great everything is during the day</div><div>and how everything is cold</div><div>during the night.</div><div><br></div><div>Change where the people&nbsp;</div><div>have gone where they often seem to go where</div><div>they happen to be where they&nbsp;</div><div>want to see more where they&nbsp;</div><div>seem to be where they often go where.</div><div><br></div><div>how are the</div><div>pages on the</div><div>screen looking</div><div><br></div><div>when the pages</div><div>on the screen are</div><div>not very digital&nbsp;</div><div>when the pages</div><div>on the screen are not.</div><div><br></div><div>all that amazing when the pages.</div><div>change into new pages of new material.</div><div><br></div><div>FEMINISM</div><div>Favorite feminist icon</div><div>The next thing the feminist movement has to focus on is</div><div>The kind of feminism I most identify with</div><div>How I deal with people who are anti-feminist</div><div>My thoughts on male allies</div><div>Queen Boudica</div><div>Queen Victoria</div><div>Queen Elizabeth I</div><div>Catherine the Great</div><div>Margaret Thatcher</div><div>Carly Fiorina</div><div>Meg Whitman</div><div>Hillary Clinton</div><div><br></div><div>I think that a real feminist does something great,&nbsp;</div><div>and that stands the test of time, not just writes&nbsp;</div><div>lists of what she wants from society.

I'm wondering</div><div>if I should have submitted a course audit for MIS 764 as well.</div><div>I did end up auditing, submitting a course audit for MIS 768.</div><div><br></div><div>The soldiers will use your hair to insulate the Salvation</div><div>submarines for when they go to war with the Devil and</div><div>his army of evil Satan worshipers who seek to corrupt&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>the world and make everyone perverted and depraved.</div><div>When the war is over, you can grow your hair back and&nbsp;</div><div>you will be beautiful again, but as long as the war effort</div><div><br></div><div>is the most important thing we focus on, you will have&nbsp;</div><div>to be bald.

A very long and</div><div>epic movie, and we will buy popcorn and burnt peanuts</div><div>and string cheese and super large cups of coke and pepsi,</div><div><br></div><div>depending on what they offer, and after we see the movie,</div><div>we should go out for dinner, and this restaurant will be&nbsp;</div><div>lousy, because we spent all our money on lunch and popcorn</div><div><br></div><div>at the movies, and after dinner we should go hope and hop</div><div>into bed and go to sleep, or maybe we will stay awake and</div><div>make love, and eat popcorn in bed, and drink coke and pepsi.</div><div><br></div><div>American Express</div><div><br></div><div>I want an American Express credit card so bad.</div><div>I keep applying</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>and they keep rejecting me</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>for reasons I</div><div>can't figure out.</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>my credit it lousy and I have</div><div>millions in debt, but that should</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">			</span>be a good thing</div><div>it means</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>that I spend&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tons of money&nbsp; &nbsp; and</div><div>that&nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>I can<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>spend&nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>all<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>the&nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>money</div><div>they can lend.</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>LEND IT TO ME!!!</div><div>give me a CENTURION CARD and let me borrow</div><div>all the money that American Express has in reserves!!!</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>It will be such a boost to the economy</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">			</span>that we will</div><div>all have jobs, and production will increase.</div><div><br></div><div>Today we had an apple fritter and</div><div>a glass of milk and a cup of coffee&nbsp;</div><div>for breakfast, the apple fritter was bland</div><div>and the coffee could have used some toffee.</div><div><br></div><div>I wonder what else the donut shop has:</div><div>do they have glazed donuts and donut holes?</div><div>chocolate donuts and all of that jazz?</div><div>and scrumptious donuts that fill patron's souls?</div><div><br></div><div>Bad bitches from across the universe</div><div>come to the donut shop on McKee Road</div><div>and recite incomprehensible verse</div><div>and poetry and prose by the boat load.</div><div><br></div><div>The donut shop on Mckee is the place</div><div>to be, and people come from every race.</div><div><br></div><div>193</div><div><br></div><div>this is taking an actual eternity to process.</div><div>I don't really know where to pick up after all</div><div>of this is done.

I wonder why this commit&nbsp;</div><div>is taking so long to push and upload.</div><div><br></div><div>Greetings Yong Li, Ph.D. :</div><div><br></div><div>This email contains my individual development plan for 2024. I'm currently enrolled in the</div><div>entrepreneurship and innovation graduate certificate program, and I was not enrolled or admitted</div><div>to any program during the 2023 academic calendar.</div><div><br></div><div>My primary goal for the 2024 academic year is to file a patent before the end of the 2024</div><div>tax year. My accomplishments for the 2024 calendar year include increasing my intellectual</div><div>property catalog by 33%, which includes the registration of 2 software copyrights filed</div><div>while taking MIS 768 with Han-fen Hu, Ph.D. for applications submitted as assignments during</div><div>her course. I anticipate increasing my catalog by an additional 12% before the spring 2024</div><div>semester is completed.</div><div><br></div><div>On a longer time horizon, I would say that my entrepreneurial goal would be to create a kind of</div><div>holding company using the traditional structure, a CEF structure, or a SPAC structure, depending</div><div>on what's most appropriate for the organizational objectives of the holding company. I was inspired</div><div>by the conceptual framework, HITA, introduced by Sutirtha Chatterjee, Ph.D. in his MIS 764 course.</div><div>I've included initial draft work of a term project below.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;(5/5) Term Project</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Topic:</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;turn-arounds and pivots: leveraging organizational courage for high-risk innovation as an</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;alternative to the conventional approach of distressed asset sales and mass-layoffs</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Implementation:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;HITA Applications for Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, Portfolio Management, and Equity Index Development</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Create an equity index of publicly traded companies based on hita, different companies.&nbsp; A list of</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;companies will be assigned.

I know that much, but I think I can live with that. the mistake&nbsp;</div><div>i made last time was to move the repository folder for my other repositories directly into my&nbsp;</div><div>main repository it created a weird problem. kind of like an infinite loop problem, but that's&nbsp;</div><div>I'm not sure if it was exactly that, but. like it never seemed to stop updating.</div><div><br></div><div>It's been written about in all kinds of&nbsp;</div><div>insane lunatic poems about love.</div><div><br></div><div>Draino</div><div><br></div><div>I bought a multi-pack of drain cleaner and poured all the</div><div>bottles down the drain.&nbsp; I think that this should do it, but</div><div>I can't be sure.&nbsp; I want clean drains more than anything in</div><div>life, even more than world peace.&nbsp; I think that the next&nbsp;</div><div>Miss America or Miss Universe should be picked on the</div><div>basis of wheter or not she likes clean drains.</div><div><br></div><div>197</div><div><br></div><div>what on earth am I thinking about. well.

For example, if I wanted to create CurryDuck,&nbsp;</div><div>PanangDuck, and SatayDuck, I could create these new classes by extending&nbsp;</div><div>from an existing class called Duck without duplicating attributes like&nbsp;</div><div>veryDelicious: true and hasBeenCooked: true.</div><div><br></div><div>Polymorphism occurs after inheritance, and it allows different classes&nbsp;</div><div>to be treated similarly based on a common inheritance. Using my previous&nbsp;</div><div>example: CurryDuck, PanangDuck, and SatayDuck would inherit from the Duck&nbsp;</div><div>class, but starting with CurryDuck, I might have something like a preparation()&nbsp;</div><div>method as part of the CurryDuck subclass, this preparation() method would change&nbsp;</div><div>in the PanangDuck class and again in the SatayDuck class, but these different&nbsp;</div><div>classes, CurryDuck, PanangDuck, and SatayDuck would be treated similarly to each&nbsp;</div><div>other, but differently from classes like MuttonBriyani, BucheMenudo and&nbsp;</div><div>SalmonSashimi because of their common inheritance from the Duck class.</div><div><br></div><div>I enrolled in a web development bootcamp through an employer funded&nbsp;</div><div>education reimbursement program.

I think that I will write them</div><div>here before publicly publishing them on Blogger.</div><div><br></div><div>8</div><div><br></div><div>I was on campus yesterday. I had class, but the class&nbsp;</div><div>was held remotely. The campus has serious cell data&nbsp;</div><div>coverage shadows, and, I had trouble connecting. It's&nbsp;</div><div>not like I have passwords that are easy to remember,&nbsp;</div><div>and I definitely don't use passwords, the same passwords&nbsp;</div><div>for multiple accounts, so, I often I have to use an alternate&nbsp;</div><div>authentication method to sign in, but if I'm in a serious&nbsp;</div><div>coverage shadow, logging in becomes impossible, so, I&nbsp;</div><div>basically couldn't log in, and I basically couldn't work&nbsp;</div><div>on anything while I was on campus.</div><div><br></div><div>9</div><div><br></div><div>I still have to do some work. Money work right now, well</div><div>not right now, not this minute, I just finished, but I</div><div>have to work later today. this is such a nightmare. A&nbsp;</div><div>real nightmare.</div><div><br></div><div>10</div><div><br></div><div>I really don't think that filing a software copyright is</div><div>enough. I really want to file a software patent. I really do.</div><div>Such a nightmare! MIS 768. I think that I'm failing. She</div><div>hasn't graded several of my assignments, and I haven't really</div><div>formally audited the course yet, thinking that I might still&nbsp;</div><div>have a chance at a C. I would take a C in the course and move</div><div>one, but, it's still up in the air until I get a grade, but.</div><div>on March 29th I have to make a decision, and, when it all&nbsp;</div><div>comes down to it, I can't risk getting anything less than a C,</div><div>so I do kind of have to Audit the course.</div><div><br></div><div>11</div><div><br></div><div>[there were a few challenges that were really insurmountable] Â· [and]</div><div>1h [I think that in a lot of ways I simply was not able to overcome them]</div><div>Okay: Twitter Blue or Twitter for Professionals? Here's the thing:&nbsp;</div><div>there is a Twitter Parody Policy for Professional Accounts, and I've&nbsp;</div><div>never figured this out, how is a factious remarks focused account&nbsp;</div><div>different from parody account? and at what point have I crossed the line?</div><div><br></div><div>12</div><div><br></div><div>there are</div><div>crickets</div><div>all around and they</div><div>are eating</div><div>all of the plants</div><div><br></div><div>all of the crops</div><div>are being eaten by</div><div>crickets!</div><div><br></div><div>these crickets</div><div>are the meanest crickets</div><div>I have ever come across!</div><div><br></div><div>13</div><div><br></div><div>I tried to do some Door Dashing, but, for whatever reason&nbsp;</div><div>I'm not able to get a very good connection, there are a&nbsp;</div><div>few areas that I know for sure are real connection dead&nbsp;</div><div>zone or real network coverage shadows, so I think this&nbsp;</div><div>might be more due to network congestion, maybe the weather,&nbsp;</div><div>or something, but, I was around the corner from home, so I&nbsp;</div><div>just went back home, and maybe I'll try this again later.</div><div><br></div><div>It's not clear to me why a city like Las Vegas, the metro&nbsp;</div><div>Las Vegas area would have coverage shadows at all, even,&nbsp;</div><div>when I was on campus.

I really&nbsp;</div><div>feel like I never have enough fucking&nbsp;</div><div>energy. Or, any extra energy. I do work&nbsp;</div><div>long hours, and, being tired is normal&nbsp;</div><div>in these cases.</div><div><br></div><div>61</div><div><br></div><div>I had 2 energy drinks today. I remember&nbsp;</div><div>trying to cut down a while ago, and I&nbsp;</div><div>just haven't been able to stay very alert&nbsp;</div><div>or energetic without them.</div><div><br></div><div>There is a Circle K gas station on my way&nbsp;</div><div>home that I've stopped at several times&nbsp;</div><div>over the past few days. I still really&nbsp;</div><div>like QuikTrip, but, I feel awkward going&nbsp;</div><div>to the one near my house since I worked&nbsp;</div><div>there, and, sort of quit abruptly.</div><div><br></div><div>What I couldn't stand was being switched&nbsp;</div><div>from task to task. I would be in the middle&nbsp;</div><div>of one task and reassigned before the task&nbsp;</div><div>was completed, repeatedly, and then, knocked&nbsp;</div><div>for leaving a previous task incomplete. Or,&nbsp;</div><div>in some cases, I'd be rushed during one task,&nbsp;</div><div>and then knocked for having skipped steps or&nbsp;</div><div>having cut corners in some way or for missing&nbsp;</div><div>some minor detail, when, I had I focused on&nbsp;</div><div>the details, the task wouldn't have been&nbsp;</div><div>completed in a timely manner. I figured that&nbsp;</div><div>this abuse was simply either part of the culture,&nbsp;</div><div>or, part of the process or something. So, I figured&nbsp;</div><div>that someone else could deal with this. What a&nbsp;</div><div>nightmare. Anyway.</div><div><br></div><div>62</div><div><br></div><div>there is something</div><div>really irritating that</div><div>I have to deal with</div><div>and it is. well. guess?</div><div><br></div><div>it is something so annoying</div><div>that you can see where the</div><div>oranges are playing the horses.</div><div><br></div><div>but there * are changes * so see</div><div>how they all make * new hours for</div><div>all of the places where we see them.</div><div><br></div><div>Sometimes I reflect on how one&nbsp;</div><div>thing or another turned out, whether&nbsp;</div><div>a social interaction or whatever, and&nbsp;</div><div>sometimes I think, maybe, this or that&nbsp;</div><div>response was suboptimal, or something.&nbsp;</div><div>Maybe I didn't pass the test.

UNLV, UMKC, and now UTA.&nbsp;</div><div>I have to go.</div><div><br></div><div>What's one challenge that I'm facing? Well, I hardly&nbsp;</div><div>know anyone out here. I don't want to get in contact&nbsp;</div><div>with anyone from before Arlington.</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe I can ask the land lady for a letter of recommendation.</div><div>I just don't know.

Running out of money before I get this&nbsp;</div><div>started, or before I can get student loans. The general&nbsp;</div><div>consensus is that going to graduate school is less prudent&nbsp;</div><div>than going to a trade school or vocational school, but I&nbsp;</div><div>definitely can't seem to get into a vocational school. I&nbsp;</div><div>tried 3 times and I just couldn't do it. I have no idea&nbsp;</div><div>what the fuck to do. This is a nightmare. A real nightmare.</div><div><br></div><div>71</div><div><br></div><div>Thinking about the issues that I've faced in the past. I think.&nbsp;</div><div>I had an opportunity to go to UMKC, there was a position at the&nbsp;</div><div>Post Office in Kansas City, that I declined, because it would have&nbsp;</div><div>been less, in total, than what I was making working at the Tractor&nbsp;</div><div>Warehouse and the Hotel.</div><div><br></div><div>I logged my miles. I need to figure out my expenses as well. The</div><div>thing is that, there are certain expenses that are accounted for&nbsp;</div><div>in the logging of milage, and some that are not. some expenses. and</div><div>some expenses have different kinds of treatments.</div><div><br></div><div>but I remember thinking, that, maybe not going to UNLV or UMKC worked&nbsp;</div><div>out for the best. The COVID-19 Pandemic hit, and, had I attended either&nbsp;</div><div>UMKC or UNLV, it just wouldn't have worked out, or, it would have been&nbsp;</div><div>disrupted in a major way.</div><div><br></div><div>With expectations of a recession, it might make sense for me to go to&nbsp;</div><div>college now, this might be the. I don't want to think that this will be&nbsp;</div><div>the last time that I do this.

This is a nightmare, because, it&nbsp;</div><div>feels like it just adds hassle to my day. I think of filing unemployment as similar&nbsp;</div><div>to participating in the census. I guess.

I'm tired. an old friend asked me to hang out tonight. we met up. and went to 7-11. waste of time. i think that she was happy&nbsp;</div><div>to see me, and i was happy to see her, but i have all this other shit that i have to take care of. even though i'm not working now, and it&nbsp;</div><div>will be a while before i go back to work.</div><div><br></div><div>17m and the annoying thing is that there is a social media influencer using the name chestnut &amp; hazel as a page. annoying. #vladimirputin!</div><div>I fought for the Allies at Stalingrad as part of the Fried Rice Auxiliaries of the Red Army, Ho Chi Minh and Emiliano Zapata were my Comrades&nbsp;</div><div>in Arms, but the Soviets had logistical problems then, as now, and we were given only one rifle for the three of us. 22h</div><div><br></div><div>I remember when I set up Prospectus Media Group, I guess I would later come across a company that claimed to be using that name for a while,&nbsp;</div><div>so I just stopped using it, but at this point, Chestnut + Hazel is a real business. so. #vladimirputin Kenneth Larot Yamat @KennethLYamat</div><div><br></div><div>131</div><div><br></div><div>think of how the things</div><div>that you've seen are now</div><div>different from what was</div><div>originally there</div><div>and now how what is currently</div><div>here is different from what was</div><div>previously here and what</div><div>was originally here and what</div><div>could be a new thing and what</div><div>can be the next thing that</div><div>is here and what there are</div><div>everywhere</div><div>and what there are when there</div><div>are things that you think that</div><div>are meant to be seen and what</div><div>are things that are meant to&nbsp;</div><div>be discovered</div><div><br></div><div>but i don't really know if i really want to deal with ONEQ.

We will even shave your yaya and it will be</div><div>bald as well, and that hair we will use as gun powder for</div><div><br></div><div>the Salvation cannons, that will blast the evil people apart</div><div>and rid the world of evil and depravity. It is the only way</div><div>and there is nothing else we can do in the meantime.</div><div><br></div><div>We must win this war, and I will shave my head and schlong</div><div>so that I will be there with you, sacrificing my hair for the</div><div>war effort, but as for this weekend, aside from shaving you,</div><div><br></div><div>I think that we should go out for lunch at a fancy restaurant</div><div>where the waiters are very patient, and the chefs can handle</div><div>as many strange requests as we make for our food, and after</div><div><br></div><div>lunch is over, we should catch a movie. A very long and</div><div>epic movie, and we will buy popcorn and burnt peanuts</div><div>and string cheese and super large cups of coke and pepsi,</div><div><br></div><div>depending on what they offer, and after we see the movie,</div><div>we should go out for dinner, and this restaurant will be&nbsp;</div><div>lousy, because we spent all our money on lunch and popcorn</div><div><br></div><div>at the movies, and after dinner we should go hope and hop</div><div>into bed and go to sleep, or maybe we will stay awake and</div><div>make love, and eat popcorn in bed, and drink coke and pepsi.</div><div><br></div><div>American Express</div><div><br></div><div>I want an American Express credit card so bad.</div><div>I keep applying</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>and they keep rejecting me</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>for reasons I</div><div>can't figure out.</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>my credit it lousy and I have</div><div>millions in debt, but that should</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">			</span>be a good thing</div><div>it means</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>that I spend&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tons of money&nbsp; &nbsp; and</div><div>that&nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>I can<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>spend&nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>all<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>the&nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>money</div><div>they can lend.</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>LEND IT TO ME!!!</div><div>give me a CENTURION CARD and let me borrow</div><div>all the money that American Express has in reserves!!!</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>It will be such a boost to the economy</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">			</span>that we will</div><div>all have jobs, and production will increase.</div><div><br></div><div>Today we had an apple fritter and</div><div>a glass of milk and a cup of coffee&nbsp;</div><div>for breakfast, the apple fritter was bland</div><div>and the coffee could have used some toffee.</div><div><br></div><div>I wonder what else the donut shop has:</div><div>do they have glazed donuts and donut holes?</div><div>chocolate donuts and all of that jazz?</div><div>and scrumptious donuts that fill patron's souls?</div><div><br></div><div>Bad bitches from across the universe</div><div>come to the donut shop on McKee Road</div><div>and recite incomprehensible verse</div><div>and poetry and prose by the boat load.</div><div><br></div><div>The donut shop on Mckee is the place</div><div>to be, and people come from every race.</div><div><br></div><div>193</div><div><br></div><div>this is taking an actual eternity to process.</div><div>I don't really know where to pick up after all</div><div>of this is done.

I wonder why this commit&nbsp;</div><div>is taking so long to push and upload.</div><div><br></div><div>Greetings Yong Li, Ph.D. :</div><div><br></div><div>This email contains my individual development plan for 2024. I'm currently enrolled in the</div><div>entrepreneurship and innovation graduate certificate program, and I was not enrolled or admitted</div><div>to any program during the 2023 academic calendar.</div><div><br></div><div>My primary goal for the 2024 academic year is to file a patent before the end of the 2024</div><div>tax year. My accomplishments for the 2024 calendar year include increasing my intellectual</div><div>property catalog by 33%, which includes the registration of 2 software copyrights filed</div><div>while taking MIS 768 with Han-fen Hu, Ph.D. for applications submitted as assignments during</div><div>her course. I anticipate increasing my catalog by an additional 12% before the spring 2024</div><div>semester is completed.</div><div><br></div><div>On a longer time horizon, I would say that my entrepreneurial goal would be to create a kind of</div><div>holding company using the traditional structure, a CEF structure, or a SPAC structure, depending</div><div>on what's most appropriate for the organizational objectives of the holding company. I was inspired</div><div>by the conceptual framework, HITA, introduced by Sutirtha Chatterjee, Ph.D. in his MIS 764 course.</div><div>I've included initial draft work of a term project below.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;(5/5) Term Project</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Topic:</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;turn-arounds and pivots: leveraging organizational courage for high-risk innovation as an</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;alternative to the conventional approach of distressed asset sales and mass-layoffs</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Implementation:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;HITA Applications for Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, Portfolio Management, and Equity Index Development</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Create an equity index of publicly traded companies based on hita, different companies.&nbsp; A list of</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;companies will be assigned. Each assigned a HITA level. This will inform. The HITA equity Index will</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;inform the M&amp;A approach. Since the HITA impact on innovation is quadratic, we would use the absolute</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;value of a companyâs assigned HITA to rank companies within this index.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;We can call it the</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Chatterjee 500 HITA Equity Index,</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;but we might not be able to use the number 500, so it can actually be any number.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;We might not be able to use numbers like</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;500 - S&amp;P 500, the s&amp;p</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;30 - Dow 30, dow jones industrial average, the dow</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;3000 - Russell 3000</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;5000 - WIlshire 5000</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;100 - NASDAQ 100, the nasdaq</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, maybe not because there is a NASDAQ 100 and an S&amp;P 100. So we might be able to use 500.</div><div><br></div><div>Sincerely,</div><div><br></div><div>Kenneth Larot Yamat</div><div><br></div><div>196</div><div><br></div><div>my idea is that I will dismantle all of my repositories, other than my main repository.</div><div>I tried this before and it failed spectacularly, but this time I'm going about it differently,</div><div>everything is going to break. I know that much, but I think I can live with that. the mistake&nbsp;</div><div>i made last time was to move the repository folder for my other repositories directly into my&nbsp;</div><div>main repository it created a weird problem. kind of like an infinite loop problem, but that's&nbsp;</div><div>I'm not sure if it was exactly that, but. like it never seemed to stop updating.</div><div><br></div><div>It's been written about in all kinds of&nbsp;</div><div>insane lunatic poems about love.</div><div><br></div><div>Draino</div><div><br></div><div>I bought a multi-pack of drain cleaner and poured all the</div><div>bottles down the drain.&nbsp; I think that this should do it, but</div><div>I can't be sure.&nbsp; I want clean drains more than anything in</div><div>life, even more than world peace.&nbsp; I think that the next&nbsp;</div><div>Miss America or Miss Universe should be picked on the</div><div>basis of wheter or not she likes clean drains.</div><div><br></div><div>197</div><div><br></div><div>what on earth am I thinking about. well. I want to clean up my&nbsp;</div><div>repositories, and then continue working on my coursework for MIS&nbsp;</div><div>764 and MIS 768.</div><div><br></div><div>Inheritance allows programmers to create new classes using previously&nbsp;</div><div>created classes without duplicating methods and attributes established&nbsp;</div><div>in the inherited class. For example, if I wanted to create CurryDuck,&nbsp;</div><div>PanangDuck, and SatayDuck, I could create these new classes by extending&nbsp;</div><div>from an existing class called Duck without duplicating attributes like&nbsp;</div><div>veryDelicious: true and hasBeenCooked: true.</div><div><br></div><div>Polymorphism occurs after inheritance, and it allows different classes&nbsp;</div><div>to be treated similarly based on a common inheritance. Using my previous&nbsp;</div><div>example: CurryDuck, PanangDuck, and SatayDuck would inherit from the Duck&nbsp;</div><div>class, but starting with CurryDuck, I might have something like a preparation()&nbsp;</div><div>method as part of the CurryDuck subclass, this preparation() method would change&nbsp;</div><div>in the PanangDuck class and again in the SatayDuck class, but these different&nbsp;</div><div>classes, CurryDuck, PanangDuck, and SatayDuck would be treated similarly to each&nbsp;</div><div>other, but differently from classes like MuttonBriyani, BucheMenudo and&nbsp;</div><div>SalmonSashimi because of their common inheritance from the Duck class.</div><div><br></div><div>I enrolled in a web development bootcamp through an employer funded&nbsp;</div><div>education reimbursement program. You can check out some of my projects on</div><div><br></div><div>I like these meme because it reminds me of a debate I had about whether or&nbsp;</div><div>not different colors of froot loops have different flavors. I still take the&nbsp;</div><div>position that the different colored froot loops have different flavors.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm looking forward to learning a lot of new things and developing new&nbsp;</div><div>skills and getting a good grade in this course.</div><div><br></div><div>Jesus. I'm actually reading this poem that I wrote from.</div><div>god. I have no idea how old this poem is. 2017 maybe.</div><div>and that was actually kind of a funny first stanza. I'm.</div><div>really amused by some of my old writing. strange stuff though.</div><div><br></div><div>When people become obsessed with the next person to&nbsp;</div><div>release a sex-tape, we will acquire the rights to sell the&nbsp;</div><div>sex-tape in nations abroad.&nbsp; People will pay a forture to</div><div>us to see it, and we will be super rich.&nbsp; The development</div><div>of the wealth of a country is entirely dependent on the</div><div>quality of it's sex tapes, which should include all the nastiest</div><div>acts that can be performed.</div><div><br></div><div>198</div><div><br></div><div>I'm really tired. I napped for a few hours, but I didn't get any actual sleep.</div><div><br></div><div>I have some unrelated good news. I don't have to enroll in. I don't have to</div><div>worry about enrolling in classes at UNLV until late november,</div><div><br></div><div>this means i can just focus on the stuff i already had going on</div><div><br></div><div>the software development class ends mid november. so i'll have some time to&nbsp;</div><div>loaf around or something. well, even if. the spring semester at UNLV wouldn't start until&nbsp;</div><div>next year. i think. so i would still have december to loaf around.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>assuming i'm still unemployed.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm tired and I really don't know where to start</div><div><br></div><div>Project 12 beat me to death, and Project 13 is already due tomorrow.</div><div>nightmare. total. nightmare.</div><div><br></div><div>I mentioned the copyright idea to this young woman I work with. I&nbsp;</div><div>mentioned how I'm sort of skeptical that anything I write is super&nbsp;</div><div>sellable.

Yeah, four years ago.</div><div><br></div><div>I had two limit orders process, this kind of worries me, and to&nbsp;</div><div>confirm my worries, my portfolio was down about 400 bucks today.&nbsp;</div><div>Nightmare, but the larger of the two orders was for a preferred&nbsp;</div><div>shares ETF, so I'm too worried about that one. They don't seem to&nbsp;</div><div>fluctuate upward too much, and they hover at the same price year&nbsp;</div><div>over year, the only opportunities I see with those funds are with&nbsp;</div><div>the dividends, and during these market drops where I can by them&nbsp;</div><div>at a discount to what they usually go for.</div><div><br></div><div>[end]</div><div><br></div><div>I ran into the young lady I mentioned the whole copyright idea to&nbsp;</div><div>at the gas station, this happened before, and the last time I was&nbsp;</div><div>too shy to approach her, but this time I did. I said hello as she&nbsp;</div><div>was getting gasoline, and I was shocked by how much her bill was.</div><div>Another limit order was just processed. Holy shit.</div><div><br></div><div>well. since i mentioned the whole copyright thing to her i think&nbsp;</div><div>that i am now stuck to it. i have to go through with filing a copyright.&nbsp;</div><div>getting a copyright is not for bragging rights. it's just about checking&nbsp;</div><div>that box off on my bucket list. i'm going to write her a poem.</div><div><br></div><div>200</div><div><br></div><div>this is still taking forever to commit and push. i don't know what to do.</div><div>once all of these files are transferred into my main repository, and.</div><div>once all of the other repositories are dismantled, and their files are&nbsp;</div><div>transferred to my main repository, I will start.

I'll insert a few iframes below.</div><div><br></div><div>5</div><div><br></div><div>anyway, I'm kind of lost and don't really know what to do, i need to go over this course material. I don't know why this most&nbsp;</div><div>recent project has monopolized my time. I got tied down with front-end&nbsp;</div><div>aspects that had almost nothing to do with the assignment, and I'm irritated about it.</div><div><br></div><div>My new restart version of project 14 did not go as well as I thought it would have gone. I don't know what to do. I'm in a bad mood.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There are two things that I'm thinking about doing, forking project 14 version 2 to start project 14 version 3, making one more attempt&nbsp;</div><div>at the iframe carousel, and then getting the JSON and asynchronous stuff into project 14.</div><div><br></div><div>the other idea is going back to project 14 version 1 and just shoving the 2 additional things into it, it's a mess, but it works,&nbsp;</div><div>and the cleaner version 2 doesn't work.</div><div><br></div><div>Irritated.</div><div><br></div><div>6</div><div><br></div><div>i'm in class right now, and all this new material is going way over my head. I'm tired, and I haven't paid attention in class in weeks.&nbsp;</div><div>most of the time I'm in class trying to figure out past assignments.</div><div><br></div><div>7</div><div><br></div><div>my nails are. and I swore I just cut them, but they are long enough to be interfering with my ability to type.</div><div><br></div><div>8</div><div><br></div><div>do I have any money?</div><div><br></div><div>9</div><div><br></div><div>I'm a little bit lost right now.</div><div><br></div><div>10</div><div><br></div><div>I'm trying to think.

I integrated leaflet to my</div><div>Hamburgers project, and Connections for Mobile assignment.</div><div><br></div><div>I have a few class assignments, and I also have</div><div>some kind of professional development project that I have to</div><div>do.</div><div><br></div><div>and</div><div>I think that might be it.</div><div><br></div><div>11</div><div><br></div><div>Chestnut + Hazel was</div><div>originally founded as the DM Literary Review.</div><div><br></div><div>12</div><div><br></div><div>I really don't know what to do about money right now.</div><div><br></div><div>13</div><div><br></div><div>"Everything I had done has to be done over; I was on the wrong track entirely, and after working hard&nbsp;</div><div>most of that time: I'm still only at the beginning." - Gustave Flaubert</div><div><br></div><div>14</div><div><br></div><div>I don't know what to do right now.</div><div><br></div><div>15</div><div><br></div><div>[Development Notes]</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40211944/stop-playing-video-in-iframe-when-modal-is-closed --&gt;</div><div>&lt;!-- check for deployment after a while. this was moved from codepen into vscode and uploaded to GitHub to make this function better.</div><div>I really want to update this, maybe even change the look of it. --&gt;</div><div><br></div><div>16</div><div><br></div><div>I think this was about my chestnut + hazel connections page for project 14.</div><div><br></div><div>17</div><div><br></div><div>I'm uploading content to my YouTube channel, I'm not sure how exciting these videos are.&nbsp;</div><div>some of these videos are very long, and take a long time to upload as well, and I can't really upload all of them at once because&nbsp;</div><div>my account doesn't have those permissions just yet.</div><div><br></div><div>18</div><div><br></div><div>my nails aren't that long, but I had to cut them because they are messing with my ability to type again.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>19</div><div><br></div><div>I really don't know what to do about money.</div><div><br></div><div>20</div><div><br></div><div>[Development Commentary]</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;!-- [11/05/2023 06:00 AM] [11/04/2023 23:10] --&gt;</div><div>&lt;!-- [11/05/2023 06:00 AM]</div><div>[11/05/2023 06:00 AM] [Development Commentary] [11/05/2023 03:35] [11/05/2023 03:40]</div><div>[11/05/2023 06:00 AM]</div><div><br></div><div>Even with as much time as I've spent on this, and seemingly no closer to getting a JSON file working, I seem to have</div><div>made a breakthrough with this carousel.

I need to do something with these gaming videos, like add&nbsp;</div><div>narration, or, say something, about what I'm thinking, about what some of my&nbsp;</div><div>decisions are when I'm playing. I'm kind of thinking of going with the Vanilla&nbsp;</div><div>version, rather than playing with so many mods, but, if there isn't one annoying&nbsp;</div><div>issue with the game, there is usually some other annoying issue. One thing&nbsp;</div><div>that takes up a lot more time than I would like it to, is the whole business of&nbsp;</div><div>managing the faction and ruling dynasty.</div><div><br></div><div>22</div><div><br></div><div>This is one of my earlier videos from the channel, when I&nbsp;</div><div>spent time reading poetry and all of that. It's&nbsp;</div><div>interesting to see all of the voice over stuff&nbsp;</div><div>that can be done with text to speech programs. I actually&nbsp;</div><div>saw an advertisement for one that I was really impressed with.</div><div><br></div><div>23</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>24</div><div><br></div><div>"Here's to momma dollar, and poppa dollar!"</div><div><br></div><div>25</div><div><br></div><div>I don't know what to do about money.</div><div><br></div><div>26</div><div><br></div><div>This is such a nightmare. Everything.</div><div><br></div><div>27</div><div><br></div><div>There is an issue with posting youtube&nbsp;</div><div>videos in iframes, they have to&nbsp;</div><div>have /embed/ in the source path.&nbsp;</div><div>headache. I thought that the video just wasn't&nbsp;</div><div>totally live or deployed on YouTube, but it&nbsp;</div><div>might be totally not going to work.</div><div><br></div><div>28</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;It seems like my upload limit for my YouTube channel is 8 videos&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;for any 24 hour period. Nothing I've produced&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;is particularly interesting, but, I'll come up with something.</div><div><br></div><div>29</div><div><br></div><div>Total War&nbsp; ROME 2 Battle of Ephesus</div><div><br></div><div>The Spartans are on the warpath throughout Asia&nbsp;</div><div>Minor, no one can stop them, except for the even more amazing&nbsp;</div><div>Roman Military! They will be stopped! Even if they! are! Sparta!</div><div><br></div><div>30</div><div><br></div><div>I'm spending way too much time playing&nbsp;</div><div>computer games. I'm trying to make something&nbsp;</div><div>out of it by recording videos&nbsp;</div><div>while I play, but the videos I make aren't&nbsp;</div><div>all that amazing.</div><div><br></div><div>31</div><div><br></div><div>There is something that I'm thinking about right now.</div><div>well. sometimes I listen to music or a documentary</div><div>while I work on other things. sometimes as an attempt at&nbsp;</div><div>multi-tasking.</div><div><br></div><div>but right now it just seems more appropriate to work on&nbsp;</div><div>this epic and fabulous poem of mine!</div><div><br></div><div>32</div><div><br></div><div>Good Lord! I spent the entire day gaming, the&nbsp;</div><div>entire past few days actually, and I've not&nbsp;</div><div>gotten any real work done,&nbsp;</div><div>or, well, I don't really feel like I've gotten&nbsp;</div><div>any work done.</div><div><br></div><div>33</div><div><br></div><div>I worked on my blog a little bit, made a few videos of me&nbsp;</div><div>fixing broken links on my blog. I have to work on Project 15,&nbsp;</div><div>and I really haven't even looked at what's required.&nbsp;</div><div>There's an issue with creating an embedded iframe, it's not really</div><div>possible to link just the YouTube page into an iframe as a&nbsp;</div><div>regular source, and suddenly I realize why,&nbsp;</div><div>you only want the video, and not the whole page that's on YouTube.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>34</div><div><br></div><div>Walking Through The Grass (2019)</div><div><br></div><div>I remember walking&nbsp;</div><div>to work, about a mile or so&nbsp;</div><div>to a hotel where I worked, and</div><div>I had to walk through the grass</div><div>and the grass</div><div>was always wet, really wet, and&nbsp;</div><div>my pants would get wet too&nbsp;</div><div>and my boots would get wet&nbsp;</div><div>and my socks would get wet.</div><div><br></div><div>36</div><div><br></div><div>I spent a lot of time on that project, I really enjoy the end result. I&nbsp;</div><div>still want to make the contact modal work. These are comments removed from my GitHub files.</div><div><br></div><div>37</div><div><br></div><div>All the videos are now uploaded to YouTube. It took so long. i deleted my miscellaneous&nbsp;</div><div>repository, but then, i created a new miscellaneous repository because I have the index to that&nbsp;</div><div>repository linked elsewhere, so, I didn't want them to break, so I fixed it before it became a problem.</div><div><br></div><div>38</div><div><br></div><div>These videos that I've uploaded to YouTube today are taking forever to load. This time, I made the&nbsp;</div><div>decision to upload the largest files, rather than whatever random videos occurred to me to upload.&nbsp;</div><div>I figured that I could get these large files out of my&nbsp;</div><div>storage space. but, yeah, they are taking forever to upload.</div><div><br></div><div>39</div><div><br></div><div>My software development course will be over next week. This comes as kind of a relief, but I'm also&nbsp;</div><div>kind of sad about it, I really enjoyed this class. I don't know how I'm going to continue to stay&nbsp;</div><div>motivated to work on web and software development projects without project being due, everything I&nbsp;</div><div>work on after class will be a self directed project. Yeah, I've been spending way too much,&nbsp;</div><div>mountains of time playing computer games.</div><div><br></div><div>40</div><div><br></div><div>There is kind of a chicken and egg problem going on here. I need to&nbsp;</div><div>get an MMR vaccine to attend UNLV, I got my first dose something like&nbsp;</div><div>5 years ago when I applied to the MBA program at UNLV, I need to get a&nbsp;</div><div>second dose. I must have left Las Vegas before getting my second dose of&nbsp;</div><div>the MMR vaccine. I thought I took it already when I applied at UTA, but&nbsp;</div><div>the vaccine that UTA required was a meningitis vaccine. The funny thing&nbsp;</div><div>about the UTA thing, the meningitis vaccine, was that they kept sending&nbsp;</div><div>me notices to submit proof of vaccination for meningitis, but when I got&nbsp;</div><div>around to getting the vaccine and uploading proof, it turns out I didn't&nbsp;</div><div>really need to get it, it was for undergrads only. Waste of money.</div><div><br></div><div>41</div><div><br></div><div>So now I have to figure out how to get the MMR vaccine, the second dose. The&nbsp;</div><div>chicken and egg problem that I'm facing is that I need my MMR vaccine to enroll&nbsp;</div><div>in classes at UNLV, but I have to be enrolled in classes at UNLV to get a Student&nbsp;</div><div>ID card, and use the Student Health Services and get vaccinated. This isn't a huge&nbsp;</div><div>problem, it just means that I have to get vaccinated somewhere else.</div><div><br></div><div>42</div><div><br></div><div>I was experimenting with layouts for katastrophiena.com, and I really liked&nbsp;</div><div>the layout that I selected, and I actually decided to apply it to&nbsp;</div><div>chestnutandhazel.com. I think that it's really nice, and nothing&nbsp;</div><div>really broke. I recently. I've been making all the measurements&nbsp;</div><div>for the iframes percentage based, all the dimensions percentage&nbsp;</div><div>based, because I figured that I might change layouts from time to&nbsp;</div><div>time, and it seems to have kept things from getting messed up with&nbsp;</div><div>the new layout, or, style.</div><div><br></div><div>43</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I don't know what to do right now.&nbsp;</div><div>I should be working on Project 16 right&nbsp;</div><div>now. It's actually. I don't actually have&nbsp;</div><div>to turn it in, but I should do it because&nbsp;</div><div>I need the experience of doing it, and,&nbsp;</div><div>well, I've just felt a whole lot less motivated lately.</div><div><br></div><div>44</div><div><br></div><div>My mind is kind of all over the place&nbsp;</div><div>right now. I have a lot of things to worry&nbsp;</div><div>about right now. I'm watching The Untouchables,&nbsp;</div><div>Brian de Palma (1987), and this really is a good&nbsp;</div><div>movie. Class starts in a few minutes. There is&nbsp;</div><div>only one more day of class left, Saturday the 18th,&nbsp;</div><div>but it's just a get-together kind of for the final day of class.</div><div><br></div><div>I have this other laptop, a second one, and it's&nbsp;</div><div>extremely slow, and I use it for watching the live course&nbsp;</div><div>via zoom, and I use my main laptop to do the work, but this&nbsp;</div><div>thing, my other laptop, is taking forever to load, it's always&nbsp;</div><div>slow, it's been slow since I bought it, and I'm really&nbsp;</div><div>surprised with how slow it is. I bought it during one of the&nbsp;</div><div>road trips, but, it's really super&nbsp;</div><div>slow. so slow that it hardly functions.</div><div><br></div><div>45</div><div><br></div><div>I remember these poems from when I moved to Missouri from Las&nbsp;</div><div>Vegas. I remember I didn't find work there for a&nbsp;</div><div>while. In Missouri. I did get a job at the prison in town,&nbsp;</div><div>but then, it wasn't really a job that was suitable&nbsp;</div><div>for me, and, it wasn't a good environment&nbsp;</div><div>for me either. I don't know what to do right now.</div><div><br></div><div>46</div><div><br></div><div>I'm using VS code right now, working on compiling the Adventures</div><div>of Chestnut + Hazel into a unified EPIC poem of the most EPIC&nbsp;</div><div>proportions!</div><div><br></div><div>47</div><div><br></div><div>I am failing MIS 768. Some of this is my own doing.&nbsp;</div><div>when is it not my own doing? but</div><div>one of the things</div><div>that makes this first semester different from the</div><div>web development course I took with Correlation One</div><div>is that I'm working right now.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>48</div><div><br></div><div>I decided to take work off during the Fall, but I've&nbsp;</div><div>decided that I can't really afford to do that during the&nbsp;</div><div>spring. Nightmare.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>49</div><div><br></div><div>I don't know. like. this might be&nbsp;</div><div>the end of my educational pursuits.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm going to post some old poems I wrote,&nbsp;</div><div>probably while I was at Mosaic, or during&nbsp;</div><div>the first few months when I first came to Missouri.</div><div><br></div><div>50</div><div><br></div><div>I guess you could call it</div><div>something of a wooded area.</div><div><br></div><div>51</div><div><br></div><div>There are trees and stuff and</div><div>A little bit of other flora.</div><div><br></div><div>52</div><div><br></div><div>I really like it.</div><div><br></div><div>I want to put all the ashes there</div><div>and let the trees absorb the nutrients of</div><div>the ashes. Maybe someday there will be</div><div>a cure for whatever illness needs curing</div><div>in that tree.</div><div><br></div><div>53</div><div><br></div><div>After we burn the trash, we look for any metal</div><div>that we can sell to the scrap yard. Burnt Tires</div><div>leave wires of metal that can be sold to the</div><div>scarp yard. What metal is it. I don't know.</div><div><br></div><div>54</div><div><br></div><div>All the gaming videos that I've captured are either being uploaded to my&nbsp;</div><div>Chestnut + Hazel channel, or my personal channel, so that's out of the way,&nbsp;</div><div>but many of the files are very large, and they are taking a long time to&nbsp;</div><div>upload, so I have to find something else to do in the meantime, I was supposed&nbsp;</div><div>to update my browser either today or yesterday, but I forgot to do it, with all&nbsp;</div><div>of this uploading I have to do, I have to keep my browser open. So I basically&nbsp;</div><div>haven't closed it and re-opened it to update my browser.</div><div><br></div><div>55</div><div><br></div><div>My plans for the next few days are to finish uploading all of my gaming videos&nbsp;</div><div>to my Chestnut + Hazel YouTube channel, and then hold off on gaming for a while.&nbsp;</div><div>I could probably get all of that done today. I have so many videos uploaded already,&nbsp;</div><div>and I think that I have about 20 more that I'm in the process of uploading. I scheduled&nbsp;</div><div>them way out into the future, all the way until the end of 2024 because I didn't want them&nbsp;</div><div>all dropping at once. Once that's done I'm going to focus on putting together my UNLV&nbsp;</div><div>applications. I just noticed something funny, I noticed that when Slack loads, the&nbsp;</div><div>screen says: Reticulating Splines, which is from SimCity.</div><div><br></div><div>I have 7 videos left to upload. A lot of these videos have just been sped up with 4x or&nbsp;</div><div>16x to reduce the file size, and make the action happen more quickly.</div><div><br></div><div>56</div><div><br></div><div>I'm really happy about completing the Software&nbsp;</div><div>Development course, and I'm really proud of&nbsp;</div><div>this. Tomorrow is the last day of class, but it's&nbsp;</div><div>not really a full class. I'm not sure what to do next.</div><div><br></div><div>57</div><div><br></div><div>Below I've posted an old video of a poetry reading video that I made years ago.</div><div><br></div><div>58</div><div><br></div><div>I'm not sure what to work on right now. Today is&nbsp;</div><div>Sunday, and everything is kind of a free day for a&nbsp;</div><div>while. I should look for work. Apply for a few positions.&nbsp;</div><div>I made a few game playing videos where I have voice overs or&nbsp;</div><div>narrations what what's going on, and what decisions I'm making.&nbsp;</div><div>Even with the videos sped up to 10x to 16x, there still seems&nbsp;</div><div>to be a lack of things to say.</div><div><br></div><div>59</div><div><br></div><div>so what am I up to right now? I'm really just making gaming videos and&nbsp;</div><div>uploading them to YouTube. I tried making a YouTube short, but I think my&nbsp;</div><div>video was over budget, time wise. I guess I'll find out. I could have sworn that&nbsp;</div><div>I've seen YouTube shorts that are in the 4 minute range. I bought this down to 1:25&nbsp;</div><div>minutes, but I'm not sure if that's short enough to be a short.</div><div><br></div><div>60</div><div><br></div><div>I'm feeling worried about the future.&nbsp;</div><div>I went in for my entrance exam for the&nbsp;</div><div>Spanish Translation program, and I don't&nbsp;</div><div>really think that it went well: I didn't&nbsp;</div><div>really study because I spent these last few&nbsp;</div><div>days immersed in my gaming, and didn't do&nbsp;</div><div>anything else really, and now, I'm sick of the&nbsp;</div><div>game, and now I probably have time to do productive&nbsp;</div><div>stuff. Part of the reason I wasn't really motivated&nbsp;</div><div>to study was because I did manage to get accepted into&nbsp;</div><div>the Entrepreneurship and Innovation program, and I already&nbsp;</div><div>enrolled in as many classes as I plan to take, and my&nbsp;</div><div>original goal was to get into one program or the other.</div><div><br></div><div>The thing that I'm worried about for the future is money.&nbsp;</div><div>I've been out of work for 4 months, and I also&nbsp;</div><div>haven't had any income, money coming in during&nbsp;</div><div>that time. I tried to sign up for food delivery&nbsp;</div><div>stuff, but that didn't really work. I don't really&nbsp;</div><div>know what to do. I don't know what to do. I really&nbsp;</div><div>don't know what to do. I would like to be working,&nbsp;</div><div>but I really need to find the right role. I need to&nbsp;</div><div>land the right role, the right position.</div><div><br></div><div>61</div><div><br></div><div>I'm not really looking for an employer right now.</div><div>and this comment is related to stanza 60 above,</div><div>this is akward because these are written right after</div><div>the other, but happened at very different times.</div><div>I was looking for a role last year, but not this year.&nbsp;</div><div>four months later.</div><div><br></div><div>62</div><div><br></div><div>I have an exam tomorrow, and I'm not even really prepared. In&nbsp;</div><div>fact I'm not even really prepared at all. I was working on this&nbsp;</div><div>Spanish Translations project, but it really hasn't gone anywhere,&nbsp;</div><div>and it's not even close to being done. I also have to find work;&nbsp;</div><div>I thought about doing the food delivery and rideshare stuff, but,&nbsp;</div><div>I had an incident today where I concluded that it might not really be&nbsp;</div><div>something that is workable. There are major traffic issues in Las Vegas&nbsp;</div><div>that make driving really frustrating, and I'm not really sure I would be&nbsp;</div><div>able to do it. I still need to find work, though. Or some source of income.</div><div><br></div><div>63</div><div><br></div><div>there was an employer&nbsp;</div><div>event at UNLV that I would have&nbsp;</div><div>attended, and that I was going to attend.</div><div>but I did not attend the event. things weren't&nbsp;</div><div>going well in MIS 768, so I scrapped any plans for&nbsp;</div><div>that week, only for things to really go downhill&nbsp;</div><div>in that class.</div><div><br></div><div>64</div><div><br></div><div>I shaved, and I think that my face looks a lot nicer than it&nbsp;</div><div>does when I have facial hair, but I didn't shave my head, but&nbsp;</div><div>I still think that I look a lot nicer when I have my face shaved.&nbsp;</div><div>I exfoliated, and I had a lot of dead skin and all that. It was&nbsp;</div><div>really kind of gross, but I was really happy to get my face clean.&nbsp;</div><div>I worked on my translations project.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The favicon stuff is annoying. sizing and stretching things. making&nbsp;</div><div>it look right it the browser tab. important. but annoying.</div><div><br></div><div>65</div><div><br></div><div>I've been kind of not really doing anything lately. Nothing, other than playing on the computer,&nbsp;</div><div>and really just playing from the start over and over, again and again. I bought a phone mount,&nbsp;</div><div>like the kind for my car, but I mounted it on my wall next to my desk. This is kind of cool, and&nbsp;</div><div>I've been thinking about doing this for a while, but didn't do it, because I didn't really want to&nbsp;</div><div>spend the money on something like this, but it really helps because I usually watch movies on my&nbsp;</div><div>phone, rather than my computer, and when my phone is just sitting on my desk I can't really see&nbsp;</div><div>what's going on on-screen.</div><div><br></div><div>I have 1 more class I need to enroll in at UNLV. Just like at UTA, I have to request permission&nbsp;</div><div>for pretty much every class I try to enroll in. I'm not sure how long I should wait before&nbsp;</div><div>reaching out a second time. The annoying thing is, is that I didn't realize before hand that&nbsp;</div><div>I needed to request permission for every class I need to take, so I didn't ask permission for&nbsp;</div><div>both classes the first time, I only requested permission for the one class I thought that I&nbsp;</div><div>needed to request permission for. I thought the other class didn't require it, so I'm waiting&nbsp;</div><div>for the other class to be unlocked.</div><div><br></div><div>66</div><div><br></div><div>Spring (2023)</div><div><br></div><div>Translated from Primaveral (1888) by RubÃ©n DarÃ­o</div><div><br></div><div>During the blossoming months, my</div><div>rhymes run in circles through a vast</div><div>forest to collect nectar and</div><div>aromatics from blooming flowers.</div><div><br></div><div>Come, my love! to our place: the hallowed</div><div>grove where an ambience of love floats</div><div>above the aromas of the foliage of Spring.</div><div><br></div><div>A bird flies from tree to tree and</div><div>greets you, and your face, blushing</div><div>and as beautiful as the dawn and the</div><div>superb oaks, tall and robust,</div><div><br></div><div>tremble as you walk by, its leaves</div><div>shake and its branches rise to give</div><div>way to the queen.

There are a whole bunch of Search Console issues that I'm not&nbsp;</div><div>clear about how to fix, and then there are minimum viewer requirements on YouTube&nbsp;</div><div>that will take a while to complete, and then there are content issues with Blogger&nbsp;</div><div>that aren't really clear to me how to resolve.</div><div><br></div><div>68</div><div><br></div><div>I want to get a new gaming laptop, but I have to wait until next year. One that&nbsp;</div><div>meets the minimum requirements for the games I'm looking to play, even the new&nbsp;</div><div>ones, doesn't look too expensive, it's more than I would normally spend on a&nbsp;</div><div>laptop for general use, but it seems less than what gaming laptops costs, or,&nbsp;</div><div>what I'm used to seeing gaming laptops cost. One of the things I'm not too sure&nbsp;</div><div>about is how long the deal will last, or if&nbsp;</div><div>gaming laptops should drop in general later on.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm trying to turn my gaming into something like a business, but, yeah, I don't&nbsp;</div><div>fully know how to do that.

I'm honestly. really.&nbsp;</div><div>I'm surprised how many other Ken Yamat, and kenneth Yamat&nbsp;</div><div>profiles are out there. I guess my name isn't all that&nbsp;</div><div>special after all.</div><div><br></div><div>78</div><div><br></div><div>Door Dashing really can be a challenge.&nbsp;</div><div>and. it's not always just a simple game of&nbsp;</div><div>picking up and dropping off food.</div><div><br></div><div>i. honestly. really wish it was that easy.</div><div><br></div><div>79</div><div><br></div><div>Um. So I did Door Dash today, I had one order.&nbsp;</div><div>for like 3 hours of driving, and I'm somewhat&nbsp;</div><div>discouraged. After spending all that money to obtain&nbsp;</div><div>business licenses, and getting a commercial auto policy&nbsp;</div><div>that's way more expensive than what I was paying for a&nbsp;</div><div>personal policy. I'm, you know. Not sure what to do.</div><div><br></div><div>The order that I did get was somewhat accidental, I was&nbsp;</div><div>toggling between per order and per hours just to check&nbsp;</div><div>it out, and the order I got was a per hour order.</div><div><br></div><div>and I'm thinking, it might make sense to switch between&nbsp;</div><div>the two during certain times of the day. The traffic was&nbsp;</div><div>really bad in whatever area I was in.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway. I called it a day after trying for 3 hours, and only&nbsp;</div><div>getting one order. Some days are better than others, and I think.&nbsp;</div><div>on days where it seems like slim pickings, it might make sense&nbsp;</div><div>to just go back home and work on something else.</div><div><br></div><div>80</div><div><br></div><div>Today. and I'm referring to the 18th, I often stay up&nbsp;</div><div>overnight. Today wasn't a very fruitful day in terms of&nbsp;</div><div>Door Dashing. The weekend wasn't as much of a money maker&nbsp;</div><div>as I thought it would have been.</div><div><br></div><div>My conclusion is that it might be better to start later on&nbsp;</div><div>in the day. Maybe around 8:00 PM or something. I've been&nbsp;</div><div>pushing my start times back further and further. I&nbsp;</div><div>thought 4:00 PM was already somewhat late.</div><div><br></div><div>If I'm going to work nights, then I need to buy a jacket.</div><div><br></div><div>81</div><div><br></div><div>Today. and I'm referring to the 18th,&nbsp;</div><div>I often stay up overnight.

I was having&nbsp;</div><div>trouble with a contact forms section of my page,&nbsp;</div><div>this isn't needed for my Translations Page, I just&nbsp;</div><div>set it up so it works, or, I'm just been trying to&nbsp;</div><div>make the links work. Basically, I took Project 16,&nbsp;</div><div>my Project 16 page, and used it as a starting point&nbsp;</div><div>for my Spanish Translations Project. One of the things&nbsp;</div><div>I left from the old page and kept on the new page was&nbsp;</div><div>a section for Contact Forms that I made throughout the&nbsp;</div><div>course I took. There is one Contact Form that just doesn't&nbsp;</div><div>really work. It's the one from Project 11 I don't know&nbsp;</div><div>what wrong.</div><div><br></div><div>and I'm really not in the mood to work on it because.&nbsp;</div><div>I just really don't really want to work on it right&nbsp;</div><div>now. So I guess I wont.</div><div><br></div><div>131</div><div><br></div><div>There is one thing that I have found that helps&nbsp;</div><div>with the video uploading process, for longer videos,&nbsp;</div><div>it makes sense to speed up the video all the way up to&nbsp;</div><div>16x speed, and the reason why is that, videos longer&nbsp;</div><div>than an hour, and even longer than 10 minutes, are&nbsp;</div><div>really slow paced, and it's much easier to get an&nbsp;</div><div>idea of what's happening when the video is moving&nbsp;</div><div>faster. This also reduces the file size, and makes&nbsp;</div><div>uploading quicker.</div><div><br></div><div>There are some games that are really slow paced,&nbsp;</div><div>like the tower game that I'm playing, but also,&nbsp;</div><div>the same is true for many other city building games as well.</div><div><br></div><div>132</div><div><br></div><div>I need to come up with a better workflow for uploading&nbsp;</div><div>gaming videos to YouTube. They take a hell of a long&nbsp;</div><div>time to upload, especially larger files, I would reduce&nbsp;</div><div>the file size, but it's not really clear to me how to do&nbsp;</div><div>that. There is an issue with gaming videos, they often&nbsp;</div><div>need to be high resolution, a lot of these videos need to&nbsp;</div><div>be high resolution, I don't even have a very large screen&nbsp;</div><div>on my laptop, and in many cases, the videos seem to be&nbsp;</div><div>blurry. On the other hand, I'm not sure if these are&nbsp;</div><div>going to be viewed mainly on a large screen, or a small&nbsp;</div><div>screen, like a phone.</div><div><br></div><div>133</div><div><br></div><div>I'm thinking about how everything seems to have been falling&nbsp;</div><div>apart for me over these past few months.

A gaming computer that can play</div><div>the games I want to play doesn't look too expensive, but I really</div><div>have to wait to spend that kind of money right now.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Two Spanish Language Authors have been replaced</div><div><br></div><div>CÃ©sar Vallejo with JosÃ© de Espronceda</div><div>&amp;</div><div>Pablo Neruda with Antonio Machado</div><div><br></div><div>I created a few additional JavaScript functions to allow</div><div>the contact forms to be visible inside the iframe and clickable</div><div>inside the list.</div><div><br></div><div>135</div><div><br></div><div>I think that I accidentally</div><div>posted. copied and pasted&nbsp;</div><div>the same post twice.</div><div><br></div><div>136</div><div><br></div><div>I think that everything has been set up, once everything is</div><div>deployed, then I can focus on making translations for the</div><div>pages that I've set up.</div><div><br></div><div>137</div><div><br></div><div>I haven't even looked at the Spanish Translation&nbsp;</div><div>project in a while. After not passing the Spanish Entrance&nbsp;</div><div>exam I more or less figured I would put it on the back burner.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>138</div><div><br></div><div>So I set up the .md files for the four authors that I'm going</div><div>to translate from English to Spanish, and the four authors</div><div>that I'm going to translate from Spanish to English. I selected</div><div>all authors whose work I expect to be in the Public Domain.</div><div><br></div><div>139</div><div><br></div><div>Getting the Readme iframe and Document Title swap to work is complete,</div><div>the next stage in this project is to pick 4 authors to translate.</div><div><br></div><div>I'll pick four authors to translate from English to Spanish,</div><div>and 4 authors to translate from Spanish to English.</div><div><br></div><div>For English to Spanish:</div><div><br></div><div>William Carlos Williams</div><div>T. S. Eliot</div><div>Wallace Stevens</div><div>E. E. Cummings</div><div><br></div><div>For Spanish to English:</div><div><br></div><div>RubÃ©n DarÃ­o</div><div>CÃ©sar Vallejo</div><div>Pablo Neruda</div><div>Miguel de Unamuno</div><div><br></div><div>140</div><div><br></div><div>This is awesome! it actually works, the title and the document</div><div>change when clicked! I'm going to come back around to this and</div><div>continue to work on it later.</div><div><br></div><div>141</div><div><br></div><div>There are a few other things that I need to work on, I&nbsp;</div><div>need to set up katastrophiena to be eligible for AdSense,&nbsp;</div><div>and, I think that the main thing is that I need a longer&nbsp;</div><div>history of posts for this blog. This might take a while,&nbsp;</div><div>and take away from all the other things that I'm working on.&nbsp;</div><div>Anyway. I'm getting sucked into computer gaming right now,&nbsp;</div><div>not with any games that are new, but games that I've had for&nbsp;</div><div>a long time. I've been thinking about buying a gaming laptop,&nbsp;</div><div>something inexpensive, and I came across one, but, I really&nbsp;</div><div>have to hold out on buying anything like that right now.</div><div><br></div><div>I have to wait before spending money on something like a new&nbsp;</div><div>laptop, at least until next year.</div><div><br></div><div>142</div><div><br></div><div>I'm working on a number of things right now. One is setting up&nbsp;</div><div>a page on GitHub Pages for my Spanish Translations Project. I&nbsp;</div><div>was having trouble with a contact forms section of my page,&nbsp;</div><div>this isn't needed for my Translations Page, I just set it up&nbsp;</div><div>so it works, or, I'm just been trying to make the links work.&nbsp;</div><div>Basically, I took Project 16, my Project 16 page, and used it&nbsp;</div><div>as a starting point for my Spanish Translations Project. One&nbsp;</div><div>of the things I left from the old page and kept on the new page&nbsp;</div><div>was a section for Contact Forms that I made throughout the course&nbsp;</div><div>I took. There is one Contact Form that just doesn't really work.&nbsp;</div><div>It's the one from Project 11 I don't know what wrong.</div><div><br></div><div>and I'm really not in the mood to work on it because. I just really&nbsp;</div><div>don't really want to work on it right now. So I guess I wont.</div><div><br></div><div>143</div><div><br></div><div>There is one thing that I have found that helps with the video uploading&nbsp;</div><div>process, for longer videos, it makes sense to speed up the video all the&nbsp;</div><div>way up to 16x speed, and the reason why is that, videos longer than an&nbsp;</div><div>hour, and even longer than 10 minutes, are really slow paced, and it's&nbsp;</div><div>much easier to get an idea of what's happening when the video is moving&nbsp;</div><div>faster. This also reduces the file size, and makes uploading quicker.</div><div><br></div><div>There are some games that are really slow paced, like the tower game&nbsp;</div><div>that I'm playing, but also, the same is true for many other city&nbsp;</div><div>building games as well.</div><div><br></div><div>144</div><div><br></div><div>I need to come up with a better workflow for uploading gaming videos&nbsp;</div><div>to YouTube. They take a hell of a long time to upload, especially&nbsp;</div><div>larger files, I would reduce the file size, but it's not really clear&nbsp;</div><div>to me how to do that. There is an issue with gaming videos, they often&nbsp;</div><div>need to be high resolution, a lot of these videos need to be high&nbsp;</div><div>resolution, I don't even have a very large screen on my laptop,&nbsp;</div><div>and in many cases, the videos seem to be blurry. On the other hand,&nbsp;</div><div>I'm not sure if these are going to be viewed mainly on a large&nbsp;</div><div>screen, or a small screen, like a phone.</div><div><br></div><div>145</div><div><br></div><div>I'm thinking about how everything seems to have been falling apart&nbsp;</div><div>for me over these past few months. I lost my job, I haven't found&nbsp;</div><div>a new one, and I'm burning through my money. I'm a little bit&nbsp;</div><div>demotivated. or unmotivated. or just basically lacking very much&nbsp;</div><div>or even any motivation. I'm cutting it close it terms of money.&nbsp;</div><div>I need to find work. Land a job or something.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The Internet connection here is slow, it's not normally this slow,&nbsp;</div><div>but for whatever reason, it's slower than syrup. I'm working on a&nbsp;</div><div>number of things right now, but I'm also kind of bouncing around&nbsp;</div><div>mentally from idea to idea, from worry to worry.</div><div><br></div><div>Somewhere in the back of my mind I'm wondering if I'm cursed or something.&nbsp;</div><div>Like, there's nothing I can do, and this is just the way things are going&nbsp;</div><div>to go for me, but I have no idea why I would be cursed, or what would be the&nbsp;</div><div>cause of the curse, or why I would be cursed, or who would want to place a&nbsp;</div><div>curse on me.</div><div><br></div><div>146</div><div><br></div><div>I'm more or less going to be continuing&nbsp;</div><div>this blog from GitHub going forward, but you&nbsp;</div><div>can still see updates here from the iframe below.</div><div><br></div><div>147</div><div><br></div><div>I'm more or less going to be continuing this blog&nbsp;</div><div>from GitHub going forward, but you can still see&nbsp;</div><div>updates here from the iframe below.</div><div><br></div><div>149</div><div><br></div><div>I'm more or less going to be continuing this blog&nbsp;</div><div>from GitHub going forward, but you can still see&nbsp;</div><div>updates here from the iframe below.</div><div><br></div><div>149</div><div><br></div><div>I think that I had multiple posts</div><div>where the chestnutandhazel.com posts&nbsp;</div><div>were just iframes of documents that I&nbsp;</div><div>published first on GitHub.</div><div><br></div><div>150</div><div><br></div><div>I'm more or less going to be continuing this&nbsp;</div><div>blog from GitHub going forward, but you can&nbsp;</div><div>still see updates here from the iframe below.</div><div><br></div><div>151</div><div><br></div><div>and another one.</div><div><br></div><div>152</div><div><br></div><div>Adventure # 3 - 10/11/2023 21:16 - Originally Posted In CSS\style.css</div><div><br></div><div>This is probably going to be the least user friendly blog ever.

I almost had&nbsp;</div><div>an interview the other day, but the recruiter&nbsp;</div><div>never confirmed the interview date and time.&nbsp;</div><div>I thought about just showing up, but then,&nbsp;</div><div>I later thought it would be weird.</div><div><br></div><div>182</div><div><br></div><div>Today is the first day in a long while&nbsp;</div><div>that I've been up during the day, where it&nbsp;</div><div>wasn't, where I wasn't just carrying on from&nbsp;</div><div>the night before.

I thought about just&nbsp;</div><div>showing up, but then, I later thought it would be weird.</div><div><br></div><div>183</div><div><br></div><div>I missed my appointment with my career counselor&nbsp;</div><div>the other day, and I was so tired, that I didn't&nbsp;</div><div>show up for class, even though it was just a Zoom&nbsp;</div><div>session. Same thing, I was playing Sim City, and&nbsp;</div><div>that was an issue, and the other thing was that I&nbsp;</div><div>was staying up late trying to set up my GitHub&nbsp;</div><div>website, it took forever, and the issue turned&nbsp;</div><div>out nothing that I was able to fix, the issue was&nbsp;</div><div>that my account was messed up, so I had to create&nbsp;</div><div>a new account. I don't know what the specific cause&nbsp;</div><div>of the issue was, but as far as I can tell, it had&nbsp;</div><div>something to do with the email address that I used&nbsp;</div><div>to sign up for an account. It's less likely to get&nbsp;</div><div>flagged if you use something like a signup with a&nbsp;</div><div>Gmail account. So that's what I did, the other issue&nbsp;</div><div>may have been with my account name, which had hyphens.&nbsp;</div><div>and it was really long as well.</div><div><br></div><div>184</div><div><br></div><div>I've been wasting a little bit of time playing&nbsp;</div><div>Sim City. Well. It's actually a lot of time that&nbsp;</div><div>I've wasted playing the game. I've been in an&nbsp;</div><div>unhappy mood these last few days, and I'm not&nbsp;</div><div>really in any position to do anything super&nbsp;</div><div>interesting. My fortune cookie the other day.&nbsp;</div><div>I went out for Chinese food. Said: There are no&nbsp;</div><div>bad journeys, only lessons learned. I don't know&nbsp;</div><div>if that was supposed to encourage me or what.</div><div><br></div><div>185</div><div><br></div><div>I'm feeling a little better than I was earlier.&nbsp;</div><div>I've applied for a few more roles. a few more positions.&nbsp;</div><div>I'm worried about things. about the next few months. I'm&nbsp;</div><div>annoyed by how often. like. my plans to get ahead always&nbsp;</div><div>seem to hit a brick wall. things just aren't really easy&nbsp;</div><div>for me. this is such a headache. such a disappointment.&nbsp;</div><div>I'm feeling somewhat discouraged.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>186</div><div><br></div><div>My head is in a million different places&nbsp;</div><div>right now. I'm in such an absolute funk right now.</div><div><br></div><div>187</div><div><br></div><div>I have my hearing today. yet another nightmare.&nbsp;</div><div>I'm frustrated right now. Irritated.</div><div><br></div><div>188</div><div><br></div><div>I'm so tired. I don't think that I really&nbsp;</div><div>did anything today. after the first application,&nbsp;</div><div>I went on to complete 2 more, and an assessment.&nbsp;</div><div>I went to the buffet around the corner. I don't&nbsp;</div><div>know. I feel like I do the same stuff over and&nbsp;</div><div>over. but oh well. I guess that's the way it is for now.</div><div><br></div><div>I don't know why I didn't but more sodas when&nbsp;</div><div>I was at the gas station earlier. Right now&nbsp;</div><div>I'm more thirsty than I've ever been. So thirsty.</div><div><br></div><div>Guess what? I drank water! it was so good.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm in a weird mood.</div><div><br></div><div>Everything is kind of a&nbsp;</div><div>nightmare right now. like&nbsp;</div><div>a real nightmare. I wish&nbsp;</div><div>things we easy. or at least. easier.</div><div><br></div><div>One thing I made easier for myself&nbsp;</div><div>is to keep my keyboard backlight on.&nbsp;</div><div>this is nice. since I'm always up at&nbsp;</div><div>night. during the day, though, I'm always&nbsp;</div><div>working kind of in the dark.</div><div><br></div><div>What do I still want? Like. Is there anything&nbsp;</div><div>I still want that I've wanted for a while.</div><div><br></div><div>189</div><div><br></div><div>I submitted 1 application&nbsp;</div><div>today. i think one of the&nbsp;</div><div>things that kind of makes me nervous&nbsp;</div><div>is when there are a number of programs&nbsp;</div><div>or applications listed in the post that&nbsp;</div><div>I'm not familiar with. A lot of these&nbsp;</div><div>positions, or, at least the positions&nbsp;</div><div>that stick out to me, have to do with&nbsp;</div><div>casino games, or slot machines.</div><div><br></div><div>190</div><div><br></div><div>I need to look for work, and I need to&nbsp;</div><div>find something, I need to land something.&nbsp;</div><div>I feel a little bit worried. well.

There are a lot of things&nbsp;</div><div>on my mind right now. This. is a nightmare. I guess&nbsp;</div><div>that the only thing that I have to worry about is my&nbsp;</div><div>class, my web development class, and, well, I don't&nbsp;</div><div>know what else. Oh man what a total nightmare. I'm&nbsp;</div><div>worried. What a disaster. What a nightmare. I'm super&nbsp;</div><div>tired. I applied for something through LinkedIn. I want&nbsp;</div><div>to go do something. Get out of the house, but I haven't&nbsp;</div><div>gone anywhere more than a few blocks away from home. The&nbsp;</div><div>gas station. The other gas station. The grocery store.&nbsp;</div><div>Such a nightmare. Such a disaster. I'm in a lousy sort of&nbsp;</div><div>garbage mood. I sent out a few resumes and applications&nbsp;</div><div>through LinkedIn, and I've never done that before, so this&nbsp;</div><div>is new. Life is a total nightmare for me right now. I feel&nbsp;</div><div>so discouraged. I know that I should be thinking of things,&nbsp;</div><div>these difficulties, whatever is going on right now, as an&nbsp;</div><div>opportunity. but I'm really discouraged.</div><div><br></div><div>Monday and Tuesday are free for me. My birthday is coming&nbsp;</div><div>up. I haven't done anything for my birthday in the longest&nbsp;</div><div>time. It's just something I haven't celebrated in a while.&nbsp;</div><div>I just can't stop thinking about how everything is a disaster&nbsp;</div><div>right now. a total disaster. I'm really hoping this is all for&nbsp;</div><div>the best. It's just that it might be a while before I'm at that&nbsp;</div><div>point, where I can say this all happened for the best. When my&nbsp;</div><div>nails are even just a few days long, when they've been growing&nbsp;</div><div>for just a few days, or when I haven't cut them for a few days&nbsp;</div><div>I find that it's hard, or, maybe just awkward, to type. It's&nbsp;</div><div>hard. It's uncomfortable to type when I have just a few days&nbsp;</div><div>of nail growth. Job search. nightmare. I'm worried about these&nbsp;</div><div>next few months. I'm worried about these next few weeks.&nbsp;</div><div>constantly anxious, and I can't really get my thoughts together.</div><div><br></div><div>222</div><div><br></div><div>I had quite a bit of fun with my most recent class&nbsp;</div><div>assignment. I have to figure out what the requirements&nbsp;</div><div>for the 3rd project, but I think that everything that&nbsp;</div><div>is due tomorrow, all the homework assignments, are&nbsp;</div><div>completed. I also have to get around to filing an appeal&nbsp;</div><div>of my termination, and I have to think about where to apply&nbsp;</div><div>and how to apply for work, and I have to prepare for some&nbsp;</div><div>kind of thing regarding unemployment.</div><div><br></div><div>223</div><div><br></div><div>A nice clean laptop screen is now mine. It's nice. I like it.&nbsp;</div><div>I can really see now. I'm really surprised with how good it looks.&nbsp;</div><div>I rubbed it with rubbing alcohol, and it's really clean, and&nbsp;</div><div>everything looks really visible. Years ago, when I moved to Missouri,&nbsp;</div><div>I cleaned my computer with water, and it fucked things up, and I didn't&nbsp;</div><div>really have money for a new computer for a while. I still get emails&nbsp;</div><div>from coin companies, marketing emails to see if I want to buy anything,&nbsp;</div><div>and, the answer is kind of yes, but for whatever reason, I think that&nbsp;</div><div>silver coins are sometimes bad luck.</div><div><br></div><div>224</div><div><br></div><div>What did I work on today? well, the course has a kind of running project&nbsp;</div><div>that I'm working on, and that's basically what I worked on today. Visually&nbsp;</div><div>speaking, my fourth version of my project, Project 3-4, isn't very different&nbsp;</div><div>from my third version of my project, Project 3-3, but for whatever reason it&nbsp;</div><div>feels like I spent a lot of time doing the things that I did manage to do.</div><div><br></div><div>225</div><div><br></div><div>13 22 90 35 12 19 86 26 31 80 55 33 91 50 53 49</div><div>52 32 85 95 26 32 15 45 26 26 14 52 36 25 85 59</div><div>06 07 11 13 27 36 26 52 36 01 05 06 08 07 25 85</div><div>15 45 78 52 63 95 85 74 85 25 63 11 01 20 10 41</div><div><br></div><div>227</div><div><br></div><div>Visual Studio and GitHub. I have to set those two&nbsp;</div><div>things up for my class and coursework. I'm so&nbsp;</div><div>hungry right now. I need to get something to eat.</div><div><br></div><div>I went out to eat. I thought about heading to&nbsp;</div><div>Chinatown and finding something to eat there, but, I'm&nbsp;</div><div>just too tired. and at the time I was just too hungry.&nbsp;</div><div>I'm so tired. I hung out last night. In retrospect I would&nbsp;</div><div>have been better just staying home. Last night was a disaster.</div><div><br></div><div>Well, I have a real desk. This is nice. I'm trying&nbsp;</div><div>to get all my thoughts together, finding focus.&nbsp;</div><div>I like rolling over my 401k into my IRA. I don't&nbsp;</div><div>like switching employers, but I like roll overs.&nbsp;</div><div>It does give me more control and flexibility with&nbsp;</div><div>things. I'm trying to think about worst case&nbsp;</div><div>scenarios for the next few weeks to come, for the&nbsp;</div><div>weeks and months ahead. One thing I don't want to think&nbsp;</div><div>about are those times with things are worse than I thought&nbsp;</div><div>they would be in a worst case scenario.</div><div><br></div><div>228</div><div><br></div><div>What do I do? I got an email from. you know.&nbsp;</div><div>the company that fired me stating that I can&nbsp;</div><div>request an appeal to my termination. I'm going&nbsp;</div><div>to do it, but I have no idea how to approach the&nbsp;</div><div>whole thing. This is a headache.

I just got canned. I should be looking for&nbsp;</div><div>work. but what kind of work should I be looking for?</div><div><br></div><div>235</div><div><br></div><div>Totally got canned today. by email. and in this case the nightmare is over,&nbsp;</div><div>because the nightmare already just happened. there's like, impending doom, the&nbsp;</div><div>moment of doom, and what happens after the moment of doom, and that's where&nbsp;</div><div>I'm at right now: post-doom. I don't know what to do. This is a disaster.&nbsp;</div><div>Total nightmare. I have no idea about what to do. I worked on one of the other&nbsp;</div><div>assignments for my programming class, and it looks really cool. I don't know&nbsp;</div><div>what to do work-wise.</div><div><br></div><div>236</div><div><br></div><div>This last assignment for my software and web development course was&nbsp;</div><div>just too fun. It took me forever, but I was able to get everything&nbsp;</div><div>working, and I think the iframes below should work. I'm really dreading&nbsp;</div><div>going back to work, and I'm also really dreading the idea that my last&nbsp;</div><div>day at work is just around the corner.</div><div><br></div><div>237</div><div><br></div><div>I have no idea what kind of position to be looking for. I really&nbsp;</div><div>want to take a nap right now. I don't know what's going to happen&nbsp;</div><div>as far as work goes. I have to remember that this could be an opportunity&nbsp;</div><div>to do something new, and, that's something I should look forward to.&nbsp;</div><div>I don't have a resume. I haven't been to an interview in forever. I don't&nbsp;</div><div>know where to begin. This is a nightmare. I was able to track down some&nbsp;</div><div>old files on an older laptop that I have. I don't know why this older laptop&nbsp;</div><div>is so slow, I bought it last year, but from the very beginning it just didn't&nbsp;</div><div>work very quickly. Moving the files took about an hour, and I want to say that&nbsp;</div><div>the total number of files was around 20,000 at maybe 200 GB, and I really don't&nbsp;</div><div>think that's a lot of stuff to move, it was just from my computers internal storage&nbsp;</div><div>to an external storage device. an hour. really.</div><div><br></div><div>238</div><div><br></div><div>I am already tired of compiling this document</div><div>or putting together this massive, epic poem of mine!</div><div>tired really tired.</div><div><br></div><div>239</div><div><br></div><div>Not really feeling all that fabulous. I've been using&nbsp;</div><div>some of the dating apps again, but, being on those things&nbsp;</div><div>makes me unhappy more often than it makes me happy. They&nbsp;</div><div>depress me more than they elevate my mood in any way. This&nbsp;</div><div>dating app stuff really makes me unhappy, and maybe that's&nbsp;</div><div>the whole idea. I don't want to do it, I want to get off&nbsp;</div><div>these dating apps, and I think that I will.</div><div><br></div><div>Working and and reworking some of my course projects&nbsp;</div><div>turned out to be very enjoyable. I think that I took&nbsp;</div><div>it in one direction, and then wanted to go back and&nbsp;</div><div>take it in a slightly different direction. I want to&nbsp;</div><div>continue to try a few things, but we are already moving&nbsp;</div><div>on to new things, and I still want to play around with&nbsp;</div><div>it. I think that if I started on it sooner, than I could&nbsp;</div><div>have spent more time playing around with it, but I more&nbsp;</div><div>or less just started on it this morning.</div><div><br></div><div>There are 3 copyright registrations pending,&nbsp;</div><div>and 1 trademark registration pending for&nbsp;</div><div>Chestnut + Hazel. This should be kind of cool.&nbsp;</div><div>I'm really unhappy about all the dating app&nbsp;</div><div>stuff. I really want to delete these things.&nbsp;</div><div>I'm not happy with them. I don't know what to&nbsp;</div><div>do with them, mothball them maybe. I'm really&nbsp;</div><div>not feeling well, at all, everything is just a&nbsp;</div><div>total nightmare. dread. everything. is not going&nbsp;</div><div>well. I don't know what on earth to do about work.&nbsp;</div><div>My inclination is to wait until I'm canned before&nbsp;</div><div>I do any job search kind of stuff. My suspension&nbsp;</div><div>ends on August 8th, and at that point I'll know if&nbsp;</div><div>I'm going to get canned, or if I'm going to go back&nbsp;</div><div>to work. I haven't done well in the 8 or whatever&nbsp;</div><div>weeks I've been at this new location.</div><div><br></div><div>and it's not like starting today with any job search&nbsp;</div><div>is really going to give me any kind of advantage. 3&nbsp;</div><div>or 4 days or whatever is not a huge head start.</div><div><br></div><div>240</div><div><br></div><div>So Chestnut + Hazel officially has a trademark&nbsp;</div><div>pending. It might be a year before I hear anything&nbsp;</div><div>back from the US PTO. There are also a few copyright&nbsp;</div><div>registrations that I have pending, and in my&nbsp;</div><div>experience, those could take about four months to process.</div><div><br></div><div>With all the other stuff I have going on, the disasters,&nbsp;</div><div>the impending disasters. I'm going to dig into my homework&nbsp;</div><div>that's due tomorrow, and see where that goes. there are so&nbsp;</div><div>many things going on, so many things going wrong that I&nbsp;</div><div>really don't know where to begin. So close. I had these&nbsp;</div><div>credit cards on the way to zero, and now this. I'm frozen&nbsp;</div><div>right now, not in the sense that I'm immobile, or stuck&nbsp;</div><div>in place, but I have things to do that I just haven't&nbsp;</div><div>done yet. so. I'm just here.</div><div><br></div><div>So I'm working on one of my class projects, and it was&nbsp;</div><div>pretty interesting. I spent too much time on this last&nbsp;</div><div>thing, working with padding, margins, and borders. I&nbsp;</div><div>integrated the new concepts into a previous project,&nbsp;</div><div>and created and messed around with some of the buttons&nbsp;</div><div>that I created.</div><div><br></div><div>241</div><div><br></div><div>This chair that I'm sitting on&nbsp;</div><div>right now is falling apart&nbsp;</div><div>structurally.</div><div><br></div><div>242</div><div><br></div><div>What a mood I'm in! I don't&nbsp;</div><div>really feel all that great&nbsp;</div><div>right now. I did laundry, I&nbsp;</div><div>cleaned my card. I registered&nbsp;</div><div>a copyright and a trademark,&nbsp;</div><div>or, it has to be awarded, so I&nbsp;</div><div>guess I submitted the applications&nbsp;</div><div>for registration. I'm worried about&nbsp;</div><div>the prospect of getting canned from&nbsp;</div><div>work. Getting canned is something&nbsp;</div><div>that I should take as an opportunity,&nbsp;</div><div>to do something else, to try something&nbsp;</div><div>new, but it's not something I'm really&nbsp;</div><div>prepared for. Credit Card wise, I'd be&nbsp;</div><div>back in minimum payment mode. I was so&nbsp;</div><div>close, and now it all falls apart again.&nbsp;</div><div>I need to finish my homework for class.&nbsp;</div><div>The thing is. I have no idea what to&nbsp;</div><div>do about class if I have to start&nbsp;</div><div>looking for work again, because, I&nbsp;</div><div>prefer working nights, but it isn't&nbsp;</div><div>clear to me what else is out there working&nbsp;</div><div>nights.</div><div><br></div><div>243</div><div><br></div><div>Years ago, like a decade ago really, like ten years ago or more,&nbsp;</div><div>I remember wanting to work at a casino, but I never did it, this&nbsp;</div><div>was when I was living in San Jose, CA, and there were a number of&nbsp;</div><div>card houses in the area, and, I think at the time a new card house&nbsp;</div><div>completed construction. I don't really go into casinos, I don't really&nbsp;</div><div>gamble, and so I don't really no much about them. Last year when I went&nbsp;</div><div>on my road trips from Texas to Michigan I came across tons of casinos,&nbsp;</div><div>it's really surprising how many there are, there's not the concentration&nbsp;</div><div>of casinos out there like there are here in Las Vegas, NV, but they are&nbsp;</div><div>out there, and you see them every so often.</div><div><br></div><div>244</div><div><br></div><div>This is kind of a headache. I think that I bit off more than I can chew.</div><div>I don't know what other things to put into this Epic Adventure Poem of mine.</div><div><br></div><div>245</div><div><br></div><div>There was one in Michigan, I think, somewhere close to Battle Creek, MI&nbsp;</div><div>that I stopped at and checked out, mostly for the restaurants, I stayed&nbsp;</div><div>at the less expensive motel across the street. I played a few games of&nbsp;</div><div>some kind of card game, but, I don't remember what it was called, or what&nbsp;</div><div>it was or what the rules were, I just chatted with the card dealer and&nbsp;</div><div>kind of got a feeling of what the role is like.</div><div><br></div><div>246</div><div><br></div><div>This is a little bit of a nightmare. I can't really think right now.&nbsp;</div><div>There are so many things on my mind right now that I'm worried about,&nbsp;</div><div>and my thoughts skip from one thing to another. I want to finish my&nbsp;</div><div>coursework today, but I also need to finish my course work today.</div><div><br></div><div>247</div><div><br></div><div>So it's kind of back to square one, I'm kind of back to the drawing&nbsp;</div><div>board on the Chestnut and Hazel logo or trademark. Some of the newer&nbsp;</div><div>things that I've tried don't really succeed as a favicon, and that really&nbsp;</div><div>plays into it. The success or the failure of the design of the trademark&nbsp;</div><div>logo hinges upon whether or not it looks nice as a favicon, and there&nbsp;</div><div>really isn't much to work with when it comes to a favicon. I'm working&nbsp;</div><div>on this design pixel by pixel, by hand, and part of the reason I'm doing&nbsp;</div><div>this is to make sure that I can obtain a copyright, and eventually a trademark.</div><div><br></div><div>248</div><div><br></div><div>Chestnut + Hazel, all characters stylized</div><div><br></div><div>Chestnut + Hazel, all characters stylized, the word chestnut is brown,&nbsp;</div><div>the plus sign is red, and the word hazel is green</div><div><br></div><div>the word chestnut is colored brown, hex value #875941 RGB value (135, 89, 65) HSV value (21,52,53)</div><div>the plus sign character is colored red, hex value #7E0113 RGB value (126,1,19) HSV value (351,99,49)</div><div>the word Hazel is colored green, hex value #2D910D RGB value (45,145,13) HSV value (105,91,57)</div><div><br></div><div>the word Chestnut appears first with the plus sign character to the right of the word Chestnut, the&nbsp;</div><div>word Hazel appears below the word Chestnut, and is indented. the letter C in the word Chestnut is&nbsp;</div><div>larger than the letters forming hestnut and the letter H in the word Hazel is larger than the remaining letters forming azel.</div><div><br></div><div>Chestnut + Hazel, all characters stylized, the word chestnut is brown, the plus sign is red, and the word hazel is green</div><div><br></div><div>the word chestnut is colored brown, hex value #875941 RGB value (135, 89, 65) HSV value (21,52,53)</div><div>the plus sign character is colored red, hex value #7E0113 RGB value (126,1,19) HSV value (351,99,49)</div><div>the word Hazel is colored green, hex value #2D910D RGB value (45,145,13) HSV value (105,91,57)</div><div><br></div><div>Chestnut + Hazel, all characters stylized, the word chestnut is colored brown, hex value #875941 RGB value (135, 89, 65) HSV value (21,52,53)</div><div>the plus sign character is colored red, hex value #7E0113 RGB value (126,1,19) HSV value (351,99,49)</div><div>the word Hazel is colored green, hex value #2D910D RGB value (45,145,13) HSV value (105,91,57),</div><div>the word Chestnut appears first with the plus sign character to the right of the word Chestnut, the word Hazel&nbsp;</div><div>appears below the word Chestnut, and is indented. the letter C in the word Chestnut is larger than the letters&nbsp;</div><div>forming hestnut and the letter H in the word Hazel is larger than the remaining letters forming azel.</div><div><br></div><div>249</div><div><br></div><div>48 Logos and Logo Elements for Chestnut + Hazel</div><div><br></div><div>So Chestnut + Hazel officially has a trademark pending.&nbsp;</div><div>It might be a year before I hear anything back from the US PTO.&nbsp;</div><div>There are also a few copyright registrations that I have pending,&nbsp;</div><div>and in my experience, those could take about four months to process.</div><div><br></div><div>With all the other stuff I have going on, the disasters, the impending&nbsp;</div><div>disasters.

I played a&nbsp;</div><div>few games of some kind of card game, but, I don't remember what it was called, or what it was or what&nbsp;</div><div>the rules were, I just chatted with the card dealer and kind of got a feeling of what the role is like.</div><div><br></div><div>251</div><div><br></div><div>This is a little bit of a nightmare. I can't really think right&nbsp;</div><div>now. There are so many things on my mind right now that I'm&nbsp;</div><div>worried about, and my thoughts skip from one thing to another.&nbsp;</div><div>I want to finish my coursework today, but I also need to finish&nbsp;</div><div>my course work today.</div><div><br></div><div>252</div><div><br></div><div>So it's kind of back to square one, I'm kind of back to the drawing&nbsp;</div><div>board on the Chestnut and Hazel logo or trademark. Some of the newer&nbsp;</div><div>things that I've tried don't really succeed as a favicon, and that&nbsp;</div><div>really plays into it. The success or the failure of the design of the&nbsp;</div><div>trademark logo hinges upon whether or not it looks nice as a favicon,&nbsp;</div><div>and there really isn't much to work with when it comes to a favicon.&nbsp;</div><div>I'm working on this design pixel by pixel, by hand, and part of the&nbsp;</div><div>reason I'm doing this is to make sure that I can obtain a copyright,&nbsp;</div><div>and eventually a trademark.</div><div><br></div><div>253</div><div><br></div><div>Chestnut + Hazel, all characters stylized</div><div><br></div><div>Chestnut + Hazel, all characters stylized, the&nbsp;</div><div>word chestnut is brown, the plus sign is red,&nbsp;</div><div>and the word hazel is green</div><div><br></div><div>the word chestnut is colored brown, hex value #875941 RGB value (135, 89, 65) HSV value (21,52,53)</div><div>the plus sign character is colored red, hex value #7E0113 RGB value (126,1,19) HSV value (351,99,49)</div><div>the word Hazel is colored green, hex value #2D910D RGB value (45,145,13) HSV value (105,91,57)</div><div><br></div><div>the word Chestnut appears first with the plus sign character to the right of the word Chestnut,&nbsp;</div><div>the word Hazel appears below the word Chestnut, and is indented. the letter C in the word&nbsp;</div><div>Chestnut is larger than the letters forming hestnut and the letter H in the word Hazel is&nbsp;</div><div>larger than the remaining letters forming azel.</div><div><br></div><div>Chestnut + Hazel, all characters stylized, the word chestnut is brown, the plus sign is red, and the word hazel is green</div><div><br></div><div>the word chestnut is colored brown, hex value #875941 RGB value (135, 89, 65) HSV value (21,52,53)</div><div>the plus sign character is colored red, hex value #7E0113 RGB value (126,1,19) HSV value (351,99,49)</div><div>the word Hazel is colored green, hex value #2D910D RGB value (45,145,13) HSV value (105,91,57)</div><div><br></div><div>Chestnut + Hazel, all characters stylized, the word chestnut is colored brown, hex value #875941 RGB value (135, 89, 65)&nbsp;</div><div>HSV value (21,52,53)</div><div>the plus sign character is colored red, hex value #7E0113 RGB value (126,1,19) HSV value (351,99,49)</div><div>the word Hazel is colored green, hex value #2D910D RGB value (45,145,13) HSV value (105,91,57),</div><div>the word Chestnut appears first with the plus sign character to the right of the word Chestnut, the word Hazel appears&nbsp;</div><div>below the word Chestnut, and is indented. the letter C in the word Chestnut is larger than the letters forming hestnut&nbsp;</div><div>and the letter H in the word Hazel is larger than the remaining letters forming azel.</div><div><br></div><div>254</div><div><br></div><div>48 Logos and Logo Elements for Chestnut + Hazel</div><div><br></div><div>Updating titles to some of my blog posts, mostly just&nbsp;</div><div>taking posts that are Archived Content posts and shoving&nbsp;</div><div>them into the nearest series of posts, Reflections from&nbsp;</div><div>Chestnut Street or Letters from Sanford Street or whatever.&nbsp;</div><div>There is the issue of work.

I'm really&nbsp;</div><div>glad I did this because as soon as I get&nbsp;</div><div>back to Las Vegas I'm setting up a doctor's&nbsp;</div><div>appointment. There's no reason for me to feel&nbsp;</div><div>this unhappy. None.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But right now, I don't really know what&nbsp;</div><div>to do. I really want to take.

Really hot, and it's hot enough that the AC in&nbsp;</div><div>my car accomplishes almost nothing when it's running.&nbsp;</div><div>I don't remember it being this hot the last time I was&nbsp;</div><div>in Vegas five years ago.</div><div><br></div><div>290</div><div><br></div><div>Some of the things that you think will be&nbsp;</div><div>amazing, will actually be more boring that you think.</div><div><br></div><div>291</div><div><br></div><div>Some of the things that you think&nbsp;</div><div>will be amazing, will actually be&nbsp;</div><div>more boring that you think.</div><div><br></div><div>292</div><div><br></div><div>No ideas but inside&nbsp;</div><div>every idea is a new idea&nbsp;</div><div>and there are shells of new ideas&nbsp;</div><div>and there are no ideas but inside&nbsp;</div><div>things called brains and there are no&nbsp;</div><div>images except in a PNG format and</div><div>she was not wearing any panties and&nbsp;</div><div>for one reason or another I did not&nbsp;</div><div>make a move on her.</div><div><br></div><div>293</div><div><br></div><div>This is the way it goes. and this&nbsp;</div><div>is the way it will always be.</div><div>and this is the wonder that's keeping&nbsp;</div><div>your thighs apart: I carry your panties.</div><div>I carry them in my left pocket!</div><div><br></div><div>294</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, I'm blank right now. I can't&nbsp;</div><div>really think about. I can't really&nbsp;</div><div>figure out what to do. I don't really&nbsp;</div><div>know what I would do in the event that&nbsp;</div><div>I had to, or would have to look for a&nbsp;</div><div>new job. I really don't. I don't really&nbsp;</div><div>even have a resume. I think. I haven't&nbsp;</div><div>really been motivated to look for anything&nbsp;</div><div>new, and I haven't really been interested&nbsp;</div><div>in looking for anything new.</div><div><br></div><div>295</div><div><br></div><div>Before I left Arlington I applied for and&nbsp;</div><div>received an offer for an outside sales role.&nbsp;</div><div>I don't know if it's still referred to as&nbsp;</div><div>outside sales. I didn't take it because it&nbsp;</div><div>would have. I wouldn't have been able to go&nbsp;</div><div>to college and work. The scheduling wouldn't&nbsp;</div><div>work. That one incomplete semester set me back&nbsp;</div><div>ten thousand bucks, and, in retrospect I probably&nbsp;</div><div>should have taken the job. I remember seeing their&nbsp;</div><div>headquarters building in Nashville during that first&nbsp;</div><div>road trip through the Midwest. I can't really do&nbsp;</div><div>anything this year. I'm so damn far behind.</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, I don't really know what I would&nbsp;</div><div>do if I had to start looking for work again.&nbsp;</div><div>I did take a look the other day, but, I didn't&nbsp;</div><div>send out any applications, and, no resumes since&nbsp;</div><div>I don't have one. There was one opening that&nbsp;</div><div>really caught my eye, but I kind of just want to&nbsp;</div><div>stay where I'm at and see what develops. If I&nbsp;</div><div>were to get canned I'll just take it as an&nbsp;</div><div>opportunity to try something new.</div><div><br></div><div>296</div><div><br></div><div>I'm trying to figure out where to start.&nbsp;</div><div>I'm thinking that I should look at a number&nbsp;</div><div>of positions, and seeing what qualifications&nbsp;</div><div>are required, and then seeing what kind of&nbsp;</div><div>educational or technical or vocational&nbsp;</div><div>training I need. I'm really kind of averse&nbsp;</div><div>to working during the day.</div><div><br></div><div>297</div><div><br></div><div>This is the last day of the work week.&nbsp;</div><div>That went really fast.

A half shift in the&nbsp;</div><div>middle of my weekend, and that's both a&nbsp;</div><div>good thing and a not-so-good thing. It has&nbsp;</div><div>positives and negatives.

I was really going to put this&nbsp;</div><div>whole ordeal off for a while, but when I looked into my student loan account,&nbsp;</div><div>or the account that services my student loans, I noticed that they adjusted&nbsp;</div><div>the student loan amount from 10500 to 8500, so I figured since the issue that&nbsp;</div><div>I was worried about most has been fixed, then I guess I'm comfortable settling&nbsp;</div><div>the balance with UTA. The issue that I was afraid of was paying twice, so to&nbsp;</div><div>speak, but if the loan servicer adjusted the amount due, then there is no need&nbsp;</div><div>to worry about paying twice, and that's why I figured I'd settle the tab at UTA.</div><div><br></div><div>390</div><div><br></div><div>One of the issues I'm dealing with right now&nbsp;</div><div>is that I have a balance due on my student&nbsp;</div><div>account at the University of Texas at Arlington.&nbsp;</div><div>This is because I dropped all of my classes and&nbsp;</div><div>withdrew from the MSQF program. My student loan&nbsp;</div><div>allocation for the Fall 2022 semester was reduced&nbsp;</div><div>retroactively, and now I have to pay back one-thousand&nbsp;</div><div>eight-hundred and sixty-five dollars.

Another thing that I did that I would say is interesting is that I bought&nbsp;</div><div>US Treasury bonds. Well, US Treasury Bills actually. There are a number of&nbsp;</div><div>different securities that you can buy from the US Treasury, there are savings&nbsp;</div><div>bonds, and those are why I was setting up the TreasuryDirect account, it seems&nbsp;</div><div>that I can only buy US Treasury Savings Bonds through the TreasuryDirect account,&nbsp;</div><div>but anyway, the other day I bought US Treasury Bills through my Fidelity account.</div><div><br></div><div>397</div><div><br></div><div>This is where the things&nbsp;</div><div>that you think that you&nbsp;</div><div>remember turn out to be&nbsp;</div><div>memories that you yourself invented</div><div><br></div><div>You enjoyed the taste of</div><div>the lemonade but really</div><div>what you drank was orange&nbsp;</div><div>juice and you think that you</div><div>tasted citrus but you really enjoyed&nbsp;</div><div>the taste of oranges and not&nbsp;</div><div>lemons</div><div><br></div><div>She told you to drink from the tap</div><div>like a man, but you just really weren't&nbsp;</div><div>into that, you really didn't want to drink</div><div>from the tap, you are okay drinking from</div><div>the fountain you are okay when you drink</div><div>fountain drinks but you are not okay</div><div>drinking from the tap</div><div><br></div><div>Lemonade does not come from</div><div>the tap, even when the tap is loaded</div><div>with lemonade,</div><div><br></div><div>lemonade only comes from the soda</div><div>fountain, even though lemonade is not</div><div>soda</div><div><br></div><div>we can be friends</div><div>actually we can't even</div><div>be friends&nbsp;</div><div>you're just too fucking weird</div><div><br></div><div>you do weird shit and i&nbsp;</div><div>don't want to be associated</div><div>with you in&nbsp;</div><div>anyway</div><div><br></div><div>These wilted flowers shedding&nbsp;</div><div>petals blissfully in the sad faced sun.</div><div>at the beach lips on both sides</div><div>of the lips on both sides of the</div><div>wilted flowers shedding raindrops</div><div>blissfully in the morning sun i want</div><div>to say something original but i can't</div><div>think of anything original to say</div><div><br></div><div>she was clowning on me she was</div><div>picking on me or poking fun at me</div><div>and i didn't even realize it, but I'm&nbsp;</div><div>sure it was totally harmless and&nbsp;</div><div>maybe even well intentioned</div><div><br></div><div>398</div><div><br></div><div>I went to the DMV, and they don't take walk-ins anymore,&nbsp;</div><div>everything is by appointment only, and this works, because&nbsp;</div><div>I set up my appointment already, and it's for next month, and&nbsp;</div><div>I have everything I need, the emissions inspection, my insurance&nbsp;</div><div>has been changed to Nevada, I have documents with my new address&nbsp;</div><div>on it, and, I had the VIN inspection performed.

I vaguely remember how to do this,&nbsp;</div><div>but it's something like, when the code comes across a certain letter,&nbsp;</div><div>or character, it returns a specific integer, but there were other&nbsp;</div><div>things that I remember that I think I can do, like, I think I'm able&nbsp;</div><div>to turn images into integer sequences.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm trying to think. I did look up the subject of DanishCookieUXorious&nbsp;</div><div>while I was clearing out my old bookmarks, and this was interesting&nbsp;</div><div>because I really remember her being blonde, and for a minute I wanted&nbsp;</div><div>to look up that poem I wrote about the bartender on Collins.

I don't</div><div>know why.</div><div><br></div><div>405</div><div><br></div><div>I think that I have everything I need to get set&nbsp;</div><div>up with a driver's license and vehicle registration&nbsp;</div><div>in Nevada. I needed statements from a bank or credit&nbsp;</div><div>card, and I have that now, I had to print them up, so&nbsp;</div><div>I went to the UPS store, but they wanted quite a bit&nbsp;</div><div>of money to print them. Like five bucks, so I went to&nbsp;</div><div>the library instead. It was still more than I wanted&nbsp;</div><div>to pay, but it was two dollars total, one to renew my&nbsp;</div><div>library card, and another dollar to print the documents&nbsp;</div><div>I needed.</div><div><br></div><div>I feel funny, that I pinch pennies with certain things,&nbsp;</div><div>but I spend money on some of my bad habits. I got a letter&nbsp;</div><div>from Coppell, Texas. It wasn't anything Texas related.&nbsp;</div><div>Strange. I don't know what was going on those last few months&nbsp;</div><div>in Texas, but I swear, everything was spiraling down the&nbsp;</div><div>shitter. It really was. Everything was really spiraling&nbsp;</div><div>down the shitter. Nearly everyone I came across, or, 95&nbsp;</div><div>percent, seemed to be in a mood to start some kind of an argument.</div><div><br></div><div>406</div><div><br></div><div>what could I be doing right now? i can't really&nbsp;</div><div>think of anything, and I don't really want to rush&nbsp;</div><div>into anything. I have time, and I should be using&nbsp;</div><div>it for something, but what?</div><div><br></div><div>407</div><div><br></div><div>I have most of everything that I need to complete&nbsp;</div><div>my change of residence from Texas to Nevada, and&nbsp;</div><div>to request a Nevada Driver's License and to register&nbsp;</div><div>my vehicle in Nevada. The main thing that helped me&nbsp;</div><div>was an account that I set up with Bank of America&nbsp;</div><div>on a whim, just a savings account. Like I said, I&nbsp;</div><div>set it up on a whim, and I'm not sure why I set&nbsp;</div><div>it up, but the statement cycle just finished, most&nbsp;</div><div>of my other accounts have statement cycles that&nbsp;</div><div>would end later in the month, and so, if I were&nbsp;</div><div>to have waited for any of the other accounts&nbsp;</div><div>to issue a new statement with my updated address,&nbsp;</div><div>it would probably be another week. The issue that&nbsp;</div><div>I'm having, right now, however, is that the Nevada&nbsp;</div><div>DMV website is not working. It's down or something.&nbsp;</div><div>It's not loading.</div><div><br></div><div>408</div><div><br></div><div>that was a garbage kind of a thing a&nbsp;</div><div>kind of disaster kind of a nightmare&nbsp;</div><div>a kind of worst than anything a kind of&nbsp;</div><div>thing that didn't go well a kind of horse&nbsp;</div><div>that cannot be ridden. a kind of donkey.</div><div><br></div><div>409</div><div><br></div><div>What was the first issue that I was facing when&nbsp;</div><div>it came to graduate school? Group work, and group&nbsp;</div><div>projects. I just really hate doing them, and they're&nbsp;</div><div>rarely ever a collaborative effort. Most of the time&nbsp;</div><div>there's this dynamic of establishing a pecking order.&nbsp;</div><div>I don't want to make a contribution if I'm just going&nbsp;</div><div>to be discredited for any work that I do. In this case,&nbsp;</div><div>the person that I was originally assigned to work with.&nbsp;</div><div>She was positioning herself in a way where, I would basically&nbsp;</div><div>work on something, and I would have to run it by her first,&nbsp;</div><div>and she would either say yes or no on it, and I thought that&nbsp;</div><div>was shitty, like, fuck that, why doesn't she just do all the&nbsp;</div><div>work, and I have the final say on it.</div><div><br></div><div>410</div><div><br></div><div>This was back from UTA.&nbsp;</div><div>I still really do not&nbsp;</div><div>like doing group work.</div><div><br></div><div>There was a group project for MIS 764</div><div>and. well. there is a group project for MIS 764&nbsp;</div><div>and you know. it's something that's going on right now.</div><div>but I still really wish that I could be working&nbsp;</div><div>independently.</div><div><br></div><div>411</div><div><br></div><div>Valentine's Day in October (2022)</div><div><br></div><div>but what</div><div>is there</div><div>to do now</div><div>that you are bored</div><div>and what</div><div>can you tell me</div><div>now that you</div><div>have nothing</div><div>else to say</div><div><br></div><div>and try sending</div><div>me a candy bar</div><div>and try sending me</div><div>a chocolate</div><div>bar and</div><div>try sending me a

Right now I'm working on just cleaning up my blog and that's pretty much it.</div><div><br></div><div>429</div><div><br></div><div>Porn Videos</div><div><br></div><div>I'm thinking about creating a new genre of adult films.</div><div>Basically they will involve normeenas and gorblanas</div><div>engaging in shorblanification of their adamantios moogies.</div><div><br></div><div>It will be so nasty, that search engines will not run ads</div><div>involving normeenas and gorblanas doing anything at</div><div>all, even regular stuff like fishing and flying kites because</div><div><br></div><div>The association that people will have with normeenas and</div><div>gorblanas will be inherently pornographic, and the acts that</div><div>they engage in will be so disgusting that there will even be</div><div><br></div><div>Congressional hearings, all on C-Span, discussing the prospect</div><div>of regulating the acts that normeenas and gorblanas engage</div><div>in. Senators will run on platforms to regulate the normeenas</div><div><br></div><div>and gorblanas. Judges will be appointed who are strictly</div><div>opposed to sexual relationships between normeenas and</div><div>gorlanas. Anti-miscegenation legislation will be on the dockets</div><div><br></div><div>of every legislative body to restrict how normeenas and</div><div>gorblanas interact. Adoption agencies will be prohibited</div><div>from facilitating the adoption of progeny from these unions.</div><div><br></div><div>No one will be able to adopt a normeena-gorblana child.</div><div>Normeena-gorblana children who are not adopted will grow</div><div>up on the streets, selling teleomarkinites and shamdoobies</div><div><br></div><div>to make ends meet. They will steal mammyonography from</div><div>the adult bookshops and resell them at the swap meet and</div><div>flea market and on amazon and ebay and craigslist and letgo.</div><div><br></div><div>The normeena-gorblana rights commission will fight the&nbsp;</div><div>oppression of the people, but the commission's funding will</div><div>come primarily from the adult film industry, and they will</div><div><br></div><div>not be taken seriously, or they will be seen as perpetuation</div><div>the perversions of the normeena-gorblana fetishists. A new</div><div>political party will emerge to protect the normeenas, and a</div><div><br></div><div>separate party will emerge to protect the gorblanas, and new</div><div>adult films will feature dirty talk between the two parties and</div><div>hardcore magazine will be sold, but buyers will need a permit</div><div><br></div><div>from the decency agency in order to buy them. A test will be</div><div>administered to see whether or not a person qualifies, only the</div><div>most sane and normal people will be allowed to but these books.</div><div><br></div><div>430</div><div><br></div><div>It's hot, and I'm fucking tired.&nbsp;</div><div>I went out to eat, just fish and&nbsp;</div><div>chips like I usually eat when I go&nbsp;</div><div>out to eat.

I'm so tired.</div><div>This is a nightmare.</div><div><br></div><div>669</div><div><br></div><div>S9 here.</div><div>So here is what I've concluded about Marxism.</div><div>I'm decic8ng.</div><div>I'm decieving myself.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm not part of the proletariat.</div><div>I'm actually kind of. Really doing well for myself.</div><div>And. im going to create intellectual property. Called. Poems. They're already called. That. Of course.</div><div><br></div><div>There is one other possible way to deal with this email thing. and. it's an approach that I really don't want to take.&nbsp;</div><div>I want to do this the right way. You know. the way that is the longest and hardest way possible.</div><div><br></div><div>the easiest thing to do would be to have submissions@chestnutandhazel redirect to info@chestnutandhazel, rather&nbsp;</div><div>than set up submissions@chestnutandhazel as a stand alone email. or i mean, setting up submissions@chestnutandhazel all on it's own.</div><div>alright let's see. I think that I did it.</div><div><br></div><div>670</div><div><br></div><div>There you do. I think that I did it.</div><div>So I guess at some point I'll have to upgrade the services I use for my pet project, known as Chestnut + Hazel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>theres Google Workspace, AWS, and Microsoft 365 or Azure or something.</div><div>I haven't figured out what to do about this. I don't want to spend any more money on this than I'm currently spending.</div><div>and.</div><div><br></div><div>my domain doesn't expire for a while, so. I might not be in the market for an upgrade for about 10 years.</div><div>anyway. I have the submissions@chestnutandhazel.com email set up. so that's done. I guess I can go back to whatever I was doing.</div><div>What else? nothing else for right now. I'm at my apartment, enjoying Bushmills, the rest of the bottle. I kind of want to play a computer game.</div><div><br></div><div>I think that everything that I need to get done, is done. so. I'll goof off for what's left of the day.</div><div>I'm getting together my college application. This is the third fucking time I've done this. UNLV, UMKC, and now UTA. I have to go.</div><div>What's one challenge that I'm facing? Well, I hardly know anyone out here. I don't want to get in contact with anyone from before Arlington.</div><div>Maybe I can ask the land lady for a letter of recommendation.</div><div><br></div><div>I just don't know. This is a nightmare. I don't know anyone.</div><div>I'm sure that I'll need a letter of recommendation.&nbsp;</div><div>I don't. fucking. know anyone. I haven't made any friends or connections. maybe my land lady can write one.</div><div>One problem. Is. Running out of money before I get this started, or before I can get student loans. The general consensus is that going to&nbsp;</div><div>graduate school is less prudent than going to a trade school or vocational school, but I definitely can't seem to get into a vocational school.&nbsp;</div><div>I tried 3 times and I just couldn't do it. I have no idea what the fuck to do. This is a nightmare. A real nightmare.</div><div><br></div><div>Thinking about the issues that I've faced in the past. I think. I had an opportunity to go to UMKC, there was a position at the Post Office in&nbsp;</div><div>Kansas City, that I declined, because it would have been less, in total, than what I was making working at the Tractor Warehouse and the Hotel.</div><div>but I remember thinking, that, maybe not going to UNLV or UMKC worked out for the best. The COVID-19 Pandemic hit, and, had I attended either&nbsp;</div><div>UMKC or UNLV, it just wouldn't have worked out, or, it would have been disrupted in a major way.</div><div>With expectations of a recession, it might make sense for me to go to college now, this might be the. I don't want to think that this will be the&nbsp;</div><div>last time that I do this. Running out of money is the biggest concern, right now.</div><div><br></div><div>671</div><div><br></div><div>but I have enough, don't I?</div><div>there are tests that you can&nbsp;</div><div>take to find out what an idiot you are</div><div><br></div><div>there are tests that you can take</div><div>to determine how idiotic you are&nbsp;</div><div>and what an idiot you are and how&nbsp;</div><div>silly you are so silly!</div><div><br></div><div>revanchist</div><div>similar</div><div>to vindictive or vengeful.</div><div>dÃ©classÃ© is similar to vulgar</div><div><br></div><div>Norfolk is pronounced like Knorr, the soy sauce, and fuck, like the sexual act.</div><div>Knorr-Fuck is sex. using soy sauce as a lubricant.</div><div>Ennui is listlessness? or boredom.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm tired. I hardly got anything done today.&nbsp;</div><div>I went to the post office, and ended up goofing&nbsp;</div><div>around in Downtown Arlington, Texas. It's already the&nbsp;</div><div>morning, the day after. and I'm still kind of tired.</div><div><br></div><div>So this position would require relocation, but I already&nbsp;</div><div>renewed my lease for 1 year, so, I don't know how this&nbsp;</div><div>position would be feasible. I applied anyway since it&nbsp;</div><div>was on my list of places to apply at.</div><div><br></div><div>For a building company, however, I would actually be&nbsp;</div><div>interested in a sales role. Or. I think that this is a&nbsp;</div><div>building materials company.</div><div><br></div><div>What am I thinking. I still have to figure out the whole school&nbsp;</div><div>thing. Mainly just getting my transcripts. I don't know why I&nbsp;</div><div>don't have copies of these already saved. nightmare.</div><div>I think that I may have had them on my previous laptop, or the&nbsp;</div><div>laptop I had before my previous laptop.</div><div>Fucking tired.

I have a meeting tomorrow regarding admission to UNLV. I have to figure this out. It's not</div><div>clear to me what we will be discussing. I don't know how many times I've sent transcripts and submitted</div><div>applications to UNLV, and all that.</div><div><br></div><div>729</div><div><br></div><div>I don't know what's on my mind exactly. I'm tired. Going back to work for those two weeks or whatever. It made</div><div>me realize that. I don't know. Like. Working in a factory or a warehouse is going to be just another dead end.</div><div>It's never really gone anywhere, and, as far as I can tell, it's not really going to go anywhere.</div><div><br></div><div>730</div><div><br></div><div>I remember going into one interview recently and, there was this kind of weird moment where, the interviewer</div><div>seemed to. Well, she stated that she was looking for someone who was looking to stay with the organization for</div><div>the next 20 years or something. and I was thinking. I was thinking later, but. do I really plan 20 years ahead?</div><div>do I have a 20 year plan? because I already know that I don't have a 20 year plan, but if I did have a 20 year plan</div><div>or, something. I sure as hell wouldn't be interviewing for your company.</div><div><br></div><div>731</div><div><br></div><div>you know.</div><div>if I have to plan for the next 20 years, the most obvious thing to do is not to work for some company that I don't</div><div>see myself working at for 20 years. you know. like I don't really see myself working there for 20 years, or even 2 years.</div><div><br></div><div>You know. There isn't a single company that I've ever worked for, or that I've ever applied for, that I really saw myself</div><div>working at for 20 years.</div><div><br></div><div>I mean the most obvious thing to do, if I'm planning for the next 20 years. is. to go back to college. develop some</div><div>new skill or whatever.</div><div><br></div><div>732</div><div><br></div><div>Adventure # 5 - 10/12/2023 02:48</div><div>So what am I thinking about right now. I got sidetracked from putting down my thoughts for Adventure # 4. Well.</div><div>I don't know. I tend to be bombarded with stuff. Various stuffs. Various things. This or that. Whatever. I started</div><div>obsessing over the color of the buttons on my landing page. made a little bit of progress. realized I don't know</div><div>jack about javascript. figured I'd get around to it later. and then I started&nbsp;</div><div>obsessing over my project carousel. so that's basically what happened. I'm tying to recollect about what happend&nbsp;</div><div>yesterday, and the things I'm thinking about for the next couple days. The forseeable future, which as of right now.</div><div>can be measured only. in days.</div><div><br></div><div>733</div><div><br></div><div>I got sidetracked yet again. I don't know where I was.</div><div>Quam pulchra es sicut ibi stabat Qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet consectetur&nbsp;</div><div>ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem Quae te dementia cepit Forsan et&nbsp;</div><div>haec olim meminisse juvabit Militat omnis amans&nbsp; omnia vincit amor&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>734</div><div><br></div><div>I got sidetracked yet again. The above text should read something like&nbsp;</div><div>How beautiful you are standing there! who gullibly believes you are everything?&nbsp;</div><div>who seeks pain to derive some pleasure from pain? What madness</div><div>posesses you? We will remember this fondly: every lover is a fighter: Love conquers all.</div><div>This is basically just a collage of different latin quotes. Famous ones. including the most famous latin text of all:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>lorem ipsum.</div><div>This is supposed to be funny. The most famous latin quote should be omnia vincit amor, love conquers all, but I don't think that it is, i mean, more</div><div>well known than lorem ipsum. the other funny thing is that, delorem ipsum, is from, i guess, cicero, but his most famous line should actually be:</div><div><br></div><div>Carthago delenda est</div><div>and um, I guess I came across: Militat omnis amans, from Ovid</div><div>which translates to:</div><div><br></div><div>every lover</div><div>is</div><div>a fighter</div><div><br></div><div>Which is really funny because that's clearly a response to the phrase: "I'm a lover not a fighter."&nbsp;</div><div>and he does this to omnia vincent amore as well, where he say something like:</div><div><br></div><div>Love conquers all? so too will I triumph over love!</div><div>but I couldn't find that quote online, or at least, I had a lot of trouble finding it because all searches for</div><div>Omnia vincent amore, ovid come up only with virgils original line.</div><div>anyway.</div><div><br></div><div>735</div><div><br></div><div>I got sidetracked again, I had an ititial version of project 8 that I was having a lot of trouble with, so, I stopped working on it and</div><div>started completely over. There is a screenshot of it in my media folder. I don't know what the issue was. or. I don't remember since project 8</div><div>feels like it was something I did such a long time ago, but whatever it was. I think it was that I was having trouble changing things. so I started with</div><div>a different templete or whatever it's called in wordpress, and deleted more or less everything but the color scheme, and re-did the entire</div><div>thing element by element. so. that's how it went. super easy and I really enjoyed it.</div><div><br></div><div>I feel like there was something I'm supposed to do today, but, whatever it is, it's clearly slipped my mind.</div><div><br></div><div>References:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-to-attach-an-image-to-a-mp3-file/6c51a647-4132-46e2-a51e-b15cbf2c396a</div><div>https://www.last.fm/music/Glassjaw/Don+Fury+Sessions</div><div>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQY3dbUsVgE</div><div><br></div><div>736</div><div><br></div><div>Adventure # 4 - 10/11/2023 23:04</div><div>There are a number of things on my mind, but I'm not sure what to write about first.</div><div>I might be able to get into UNLV. I have no idea how many times I've applied there, and for how many</div><div>different programs, but finally getting in would be nice. I feel so bad about dropping out of grad school</div><div>at UTA a year ago, and, if I ever get around to making it up to Yibing Du and Thomas Thompson, I'll reapply&nbsp;</div><div>at somepoint in the future and get a degree at UTA.</div><div>anyway.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm glad it's still, only Wednesday, even if, at 23:13, it's pretty much already Thursday. I have a metting with,</div><div>I don't know exactly, the admissions person, or, well, it's critical that I meet with him in order to get into the program.</div><div>I'm glad it's still Wednesday.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Adventure # 3 - 10/11/2023 21:16 - Originally Posted In CSS\style.css</div><div>This is probably going to be the least user friendly blog ever.

And one on the Japanese</div><div>Industrial revolution.</div><div><br></div><div>So. I wanted to think about why</div><div>Things ended at the OTA. It's been</div><div>A while. And I think. Deserves some</div><div>Reflection.</div><div><br></div><div>Lets say that all decisions can be</div><div>Simplified. That all decisions</div><div>Come to a fork. Bifurcate or</div><div>Whatever. Like. You are faced</div><div>With a decision. And your choices</div><div>Are always two. At first.</div><div><br></div><div>Think of this. In a standard road.</div><div>You have two choices when you</div><div>Reach an intersection. You can</div><div>Continue down the road. Or turn.</div><div>Two choices. If you choose to</div><div>Turn. You can choose left or right.</div><div>Two choices. And so on. Some</div><div>Might think of this as three choices.</div><div>You can travel straight. Left. Or right.</div><div>But you can also think of it the way</div><div>I did. Of two choices. One choice</div><div>Having two sub choices.</div><div><br></div><div>750</div><div><br></div><div>Which way of thinking is more</div><div>Simple? Which way of thinking is</div><div>Less convoluted? Which way of</div><div>Thinking is cleaner. I have no idea.</div><div>But I think. That bifurcation allows</div><div>Points in the decision making</div><div>Process to be more clearly marked.</div><div>And either way. You can still account</div><div>For all possible decisions.</div><div><br></div><div>So back to my former boss at the</div><div>OTA. She could have extended me.</div><div>Or she could have decided not to</div><div>Extend me. We already know what</div><div>Decision she made. But let's figure</div><div>Out what she was thinking.</div><div><br></div><div>Now. It didn't bother me that I wasn't</div><div>Formally employed by the OTA.</div><div>Who cares right? Some people do</div><div>Though. Some people do like to</div><div>Be official or whatever.</div><div><br></div><div>And I'm not being dismissive</div><div>About the desire to be official.</div><div>I wanted to be official with Ash.</div><div>But she didn't want to be official</div><div>Unless we were super fucking</div><div>Official.</div><div><br></div><div>751</div><div><br></div><div>In my thinking though. Even when a</div><div>Person is formally employed. Their</div><div>Continued employment is really</div><div>Just an extension. It just goes by</div><div>A different term. People think of</div><div>It differently. But I don't. People</div><div>Think of it differently because</div><div>Different words are used. But I'd say</div><div>The mechanics of being a contractor</div><div>On an extension basis. And being</div><div>A formal employee whose</div><div>Performance is measured at</div><div>Regular intervals. It's the same</div><div>Thing. If you aren't handed a pink</div><div>Slip when you show up for work.</div><div>You have been extended. Haha.</div><div><br></div><div>So she could have extended me.</div><div>Or not extended me. If she extended</div><div>Me. I don't know what would</div><div>Happen. Would she have to buy</div><div>My contract from the staffing</div><div>Agency? And pay some kind</div><div>Of a premium to do so? I have no</div><div>Idea.</div><div><br></div><div>752</div><div><br></div><div>I don't know what the extension</div><div>Decisions would be. If she would</div><div>Have been forced to decide whether</div><div>Or not to keep me on a contract</div><div>Basis indefinitely. Or decide to</div><div>Make me a formal employee of the</div><div>OTA. I have no idea. Really no idea.</div><div><br></div><div>And maybe that is where the issue</div><div>Arose. Maybe the issue was that</div><div>She had to decide whether or not</div><div>To formalize my employment or</div><div>Not. She may have wanted to</div><div>Extend. But could not formalize</div><div>My employment for whatever</div><div>Reason. And maybe formalizing</div><div>Was the only way to extend.</div><div><br></div><div>So basically. Maybe she wanted to</div><div>Extend. But not formalize. Since</div><div>She could not extend without</div><div>Formalizing. She therefore could</div><div>Not extend. So she decided not</div><div>To extend. And maybe that was it.</div><div>By Chestnut ï¹  Hazel at January 19, 2019&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>753</div><div><br></div><div>"Clothes 34" by Kenneth Larot Yamat&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>By Chestnut ï¹  Hazel at January 20,&nbsp;</div><div>2019 originally posted on chestnutandhazel.com</div><div><br></div><div>I want to say that body language</div><div>Has certain deficiencies.

I had to deal with a small disaster. basically, i cloned a&nbsp;</div><div>GitHub Repository to my main repository, creating a repository that is both a repository, and a directory&nbsp;</div><div>within a repository. It created problems. Don't do it. I thought it would make things easier, but it didn't.</div><div><br></div><div>it's a mess. Anyway. that was a small disaster. My miscellaneous&nbsp;</div><div>repository, the one where I have project 13, seems fine,&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>but there were uncommitted&nbsp; changes in my main repository that&nbsp;</div><div>couldn't be committed&nbsp; and pushed, so I have no idea if I lost anything&nbsp;</div><div>or not. [ these were where they were all at where things went and broke them down]</div><div>[how do you make new things happier than they were] &lt;/p&gt; [you can be happy and still new]</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt; but for reference, the way i solved the problem was this: i couldn't push the&nbsp;</div><div>changes to GitHub because the file was too large, and&nbsp;</div><div>took too long to upload, and it exceeded the allowable file size, so I basically&nbsp;</div><div>had to delete the local files, restart my computer [poem]</div><div>because several of the files were in use by my computer, remove the repositories&nbsp;</div><div>from GitHub Desktop and VS Code, and then pull and fetch the repositories from&nbsp;</div><div>GitHub again. oh, and i also had to delete the offending file, the&nbsp;</div><div>huge file that was too large to deal with, directly from GitHub.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>there seems to have been a way to remove the file from my committed&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>changes, before pushing, but, i deleted the file locally before i could do&nbsp;</div><div>that, so [were all talking to eachother about this still being an amazing]</div><div>for some reason i couldn't remove it from my list of committed&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>changes to push. anyway.

I didn't have a single dime of overlap. The day range for SPLG was 50.99 - 51.40, and my estimate was</div><div>50.20 to 50.83. So let's try again. Let's review how the day went. I had five buy orders filled and nine sell orders filled.</div><div>&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-16 181158.png" alt="Filled Orders October, 16th"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled Orders October 16th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;the goal is to have an equal number of sell orders and buy orders filled. on any given day. Looking at Friday, I bought 7 more shares than I sold,&nbsp;</div><div>today I sold 4 more shares than I bought.</div><div>[I think that even if you are failing in a major way] &lt;/p&gt; [people still want to see you fail in a major way. again.]</div><div><br></div><div>938</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-16 181936.png" alt="Stock Chart: SPLG"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock Chart SPLG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;So, where to start? Well, and ADX of 17.50 suggests that there is no trend. So I'm estimating that tomorrow being a down day</div><div>is equally likely as tomorrow being an up day. I need to come up with something a little more precise, but, like how? Next, I'm estimating That</div><div>the day range will be .60 based on a 20 day ATR of, well, .60, so. HA! Next: I'm estimating that SPLG will open higher than it closes, this is&nbsp;</div><div>because she shorter time lines, the 60 minute charts are&nbsp; near the top of the upper Bollinger Band.

I think that if &lt;i&gt;The Fifth Element&lt;/i&gt; were more "Space Odyssey"&nbsp;</div><div>and Less "Star Wars"</div><div><br></div><div>Zorg would be increasing interest rates by one percent, in contrast to increasing interest rates by half a percent.</div><div>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also think that it's less likely that layoff notices would be sent out, and you know, instead it would be something like</div><div>Korben Dallas finding his&nbsp;</div><div>workplace becoming a high-attrition environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know how many times I've taken a job, only to find that the workplace is&nbsp;</div><div>a high-attrition</div><div><br></div><div>environment. and then thinking: why did they hire me in the first place? they didn't really think I was going to tolerate this kind of</div><div>treatment, did they?</div><div>[but really it really is and it really is nice and easy] &lt;/p&gt; [it's part of the thing that makes things easy]</div><div><br></div><div>941</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to think about what to do about work, finding a job and all that. My expectation is that any kind of factory&nbsp;</div><div>or warehouse work or any position at any company in a capital intensive business is going to be a high-attrition environment,</div><div>especially with interest rates as high as they are, a factory owner is better off firing everybody,</div><div><br></div><div>liquidating the factory, and investing that capital into bonds,</div><div>and will probably make more money doing so, especially with interest rates as high as they are.</div><div><br></div><div>and you wouldn't have to deal with the headache of running a business, just the headache of collecting interest payments.</div><div>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zorg: Fire one million, sell the cabs, shove the money into bonds, and collect the interest. Now that Korben Dallas</div><div>is no longer employed, he'll probably spend less money on Chinese Food, which should bring down the inflation rate on the Chinese food</div><div>portion of the consumer price index, which I don't think actually includes food.</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to figure out why it's always me that's the target of targeted attrition, like, do I really contribute all that much</div><div>to inflation? Like, increasing interest rates is supposed to motivate businesses to fire people, would you rather own a business, and collect&nbsp;</div><div>profits, or would you rather own bonds,</div><div><br></div><div>and collect interest? the correct answer is: whatever pays more. so when bonds pay more than businesses, you shift money from businesses&nbsp;</div><div>to bonds, firing people in the process,</div><div>and when people get fired, they have</div><div><br></div><div>less money to spend, and when they have less money to spend, prices increase at a slower rate, and that means inflation slows down. but, i don't&nbsp;</div><div>spend that much money to begin with, so, me. being employed. doesn't really contribute to inflation. so don't target me for attrition, Zorg, other</div><div>people contribute more to inflation than I do. other people should get targeted for attrition. not me.&nbsp;</div><div>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;but, um, yeah. things are kind of difficult right now, and, kind of a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><br></div><div>942</div><div><br></div><div>[but there are ways to figure it out] &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt; On this day</div><div>4 years ago</div><div>Kenneth Larot Yamat</div><div>Shared with Public&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt; "Thinking about tomorrow won't change how I feel today."</div><div>&lt;br&gt; - &lt;i&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/i&gt;, Matt &amp; Kim (2009)&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><br></div><div>still experiencing quite a bit of distress [] &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; [] still not sure about so many things</div><div>I'm really worried. i don't really know what to think.</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;"Leave all your love and your longing behind</div><div>You can't carry it with you if you want to survive" &lt;br&gt; - &lt;i&gt;Dog Days Are Over&lt;/i&gt;, Florence + The Machine (2009)</div><div>[there's basically not another semester if you know]&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;iframe&nbsp; &nbsp;src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qqflFMhkqHM" title="The xx - I Dare You (Official Music Video)"&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>style="aspect-ratio: 8.68/6.86; height: auto; width:100%;" scrolling="yes"&nbsp; &nbsp;allow="accelerometer; autoplay;&nbsp;</div><div>clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen&nbsp; &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</div><div><br></div><div>943</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt; The xx - I Dare You (Official Music Video)&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>[it was more of a want to than a need to more of a want] &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; [more of a want than a need]</div><div>&lt;p class= "adventuretitle" &gt;Adventure # 10 - 10/14/2023 15:07&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;is there something I should be doing today?

A total of 13 of my limit buys were&nbsp;</div><div>excecuted, and a total of 4 of my limit sell orders were excecuted, so I ended up buying 7 more shares than I sold.</div><div>&lt;br&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt; This isn't a big deal or anything because SPLG is a long term position for me, and I'm always happy to have more</div><div>shares of SPLG, but that not really what I'm trying to accomplish here.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The goal is to end the day with the same number of shares bought as shares sold. so any time I have too many</div><div>extra shares bought or too many extra shares sold, then that means I didn't predict the trading range for that day correctly.</div><div>&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>951&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>[but there were things that were more interesting than the things that were amazing] &lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 123333.png" alt="Stock Charge of Ticker Symbol SPLG"&gt;</div><div>&lt;br&gt; [things that were really amazing. and were totally amazing.] &lt;br&gt;</div><div>&lt;img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 123807.png" alt="Trades Place for Ticker Symbol SPLG"&gt;</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so let's try again for Monday. My best guess is that SPLG will be between 50.20 and 50.83, see chart below.&lt;/p&gt;&nbsp;</div><div>&lt;img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 130204.png" alt="Stock Charge of Ticker Symbol SPLG"&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;I'll place 2 orders, one in each direction.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 130723.png" alt="Trades Place for Ticker Symbol SPLG"&gt;</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;So we will see how that goes. The goal for tomorrow is to have two shares bought, and two shares sold. Or, well, since I have so many&nbsp;</div><div>outstanding orders at this point, to have the same number of buy orders excecuted as sell orders.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the reason why I'm only doing 1 share at a time, usually I do 10, is because I really screwed up on 10/05/2023 and sold about&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>70 more shares than I bought, which really threw everything off. In the following days I ended up selling 207 more shares than I wanted&nbsp;</div><div>to, so I'm at the point of, you know, I basically gotta keep this at 1 share at a time until I'm back at my goal of getting those 207&nbsp;</div><div>shares back, and, even though I accumulated 7 more shares than I wanted too today, that accumulation really doesn't count because I want&nbsp;</div><div>those 207 shares back at 49.90, and not higher.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;and 49.90 is still, you know, in the realm of possibility, in fact, I couldn't find a reason to buy back in at higher than 49.90, even</div><div>after 4 green days because, at no point did there seem to be confirmation of a trend change, or, at least I don't seem to see anything.&nbsp;</div><div>Maybe if it hit above 51.66, but, I probably still would have waited out even if it did hit 51.66.</div><div>[i don't really know well, you know. i don't really know] &lt;/p&gt; [there was something there - well it was not really there]</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 133205.png" alt="Stock Charge of Ticker Symbol SPLG"&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that last chart was a lot to look at.

The forseeable future, which as of right now.</div><div>can be measured only. in days.</div><div><br></div><div>955</div><div><br></div><div>I got sidetracked yet again. I don't know where I was.</div><div><br></div><div>Quam pulchra es sicut ibi stabat Qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet consectetur&nbsp;</div><div>ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem Quae te dementia cepit Forsan et&nbsp;</div><div>haec olim meminisse juvabit Militat omnis amans&nbsp; omnia vincit amor&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I got sidetracked yet again. The above text should read something like&nbsp;</div><div>How beautiful you are standing there! who gullibly believes you are everything? who seeks pain to derive some pleasure from pain? What madness</div><div>posesses you? We will remember this fondly: every lover is a fighter: Love conquers all.</div><div><br></div><div>This is basically just a collage of different latin quotes. Famous ones. including the most famous latin text of all:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>lorem ipsum.</div><div><br></div><div>This is supposed to be funny. The most famous latin quote should be omnia vincit amor, love conquers all, but I don't think that it is, i mean, more</div><div>well known than lorem ipsum. the other funny thing is that, delorem ipsum, is from, i guess, cicero, but his most famous line should actually be:</div><div><br></div><div>Carthago delenda est</div><div><br></div><div>956</div><div><br></div><div>and um, I guess I came across: Militat omnis amans, from Ovid</div><div>which translates to: every lover is a fighter</div><div>&lt;br&gt;</div><div>&lt;br&gt;every lover</div><div>&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;</div><div>&lt;br&gt;a fighter</div><div>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</div><div>Which is really funny because that's clearly a response to the phrase: "I'm a lover not a fighter."&nbsp;</div><div>and he does this to omnia vincent amore as well, where he say something like:</div><div><br></div><div>957</div><div><br></div><div>Love conquers all? so too will I triumph over love!</div><div><br></div><div>but I couldn't find that quote online, or at least,&nbsp;</div><div>I had a lot of trouble finding it because all searches for</div><div><br></div><div>Omnia vincent amore, ovid come up only with virgils original line.</div><div><br></div><div>anyway.</div><div><br></div><div>I got sidetracked again, I had an ititial version of project 8 that I was having a lot of trouble with, so, I stopped working on it and</div><div>started completely over. There is a screenshot of it in my media folder. I don't know what the issue was. or. I don't remember since project 8</div><div>feels like it was something I did such a long time ago, but whatever it was. I think it was that I was having trouble changing things. so I started with</div><div>a different templete or whatever it's called in wordpress, and deleted more or less everything but the color scheme, and re-did the entire</div><div>thing element by element. so. that's how it went. super easy and I really enjoyed it.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I feel like there was something I'm supposed to do today, but, whatever it is, it's clearly slipped my mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</div><div><br></div><div>958</div><div><br></div><div>[there were things that I did not like] &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;References:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt; [there were amazing things]</div><div>[I think about how a cat will strangle it's own kittens]</div><div>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-to-attach-an-image-to-a-mp3-file/6c51a647-4132-46e2-a51e-b15cbf2c396a"&gt;&nbsp;</div><div>How to attach an image to a mp3 file?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>i think about how a cat will strangle it's own kittens.</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Glassjaw/Don+Fury+Sessions"&gt;Glassjaw: Don Fury Sessions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>self-destructive behaviour such self-destructive behaviour&nbsp;</div><div>for a cat to strangle it's own kittens&nbsp;</div><div>and yet the cats do that sort of thing.</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQY3dbUsVgE"&gt;Mediocre Samurai Describes Real Life in Historical Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://getcssscan.com/blog/how-to-remove-bullets-from-li-css#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20browsers%20add%20bullets,</div><div>type%3A%20none%20to%20your%20code.&amp;text=This%20code%20targets%20the%20CSS,none%20to%20remove%20the%20bullets."&gt;How to remove bullets from li (CSS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</div><div><br></div><div>why did the cat strangle it's own kittens</div><div>why would a cat do such a thing why would a cat strangle it's own kittens why?

I was reviewing the recording of the class session, and</div><div>it looks easy, and, I remember it being easy when I was doing it.

And one on the Japanese</div><div>Industrial revolution.</div><div><br></div><div>So. I wanted to think about why</div><div>Things ended at the OTA. It's been</div><div>A while. And I think. Deserves some</div><div>Reflection.</div><div><br></div><div>1006</div><div><br></div><div>Lets say that all decisions can be</div><div>Simplified. That all decisions</div><div>Come to a fork. Bifurcate or</div><div>Whatever. Like. You are faced</div><div>With a decision. And your choices</div><div>Are always two. At first.</div><div><br></div><div>Think of this. In a standard road.</div><div>You have two choices when you</div><div>Reach an intersection. You can</div><div>Continue down the road. Or turn.</div><div>Two choices. If you choose to</div><div>Turn. You can choose left or right.</div><div>Two choices. And so on. Some</div><div>Might think of this as three choices.</div><div>You can travel straight. Left. Or right.</div><div>But you can also think of it the way</div><div>I did. Of two choices. One choice</div><div>Having two sub choices.</div><div><br></div><div>1007</div><div><br></div><div>Which way of thinking is more</div><div>Simple? Which way of thinking is</div><div>Less convoluted? Which way of</div><div>Thinking is cleaner. I have no idea.</div><div>But I think. That bifurcation allows</div><div>Points in the decision making</div><div>Process to be more clearly marked.</div><div>And either way. You can still account</div><div>For all possible decisions.</div><div><br></div><div>So back to my former boss at the</div><div>OTA. She could have extended me.</div><div>Or she could have decided not to</div><div>Extend me. We already know what</div><div>Decision she made. But let's figure</div><div>Out what she was thinking.</div><div><br></div><div>1008</div><div><br></div><div>Now. It didn't bother me that I wasn't</div><div>Formally employed by the OTA.</div><div>Who cares right? Some people do</div><div>Though. Some people do like to</div><div>Be official or whatever.</div><div><br></div><div>And I'm not being dismissive</div><div>About the desire to be official.</div><div>I wanted to be official with Ash.</div><div>But she didn't want to be official</div><div>Unless we were super fucking</div><div>Official.</div><div><br></div><div>1009</div><div><br></div><div>In my thinking though. Even when a</div><div>Person is formally employed. Their</div><div>Continued employment is really</div><div>Just an extension. It just goes by</div><div>A different term. People think of</div><div>It differently. But I don't. People</div><div>Think of it differently because</div><div>Different words are used. But I'd say</div><div>The mechanics of being a contractor</div><div>On an extension basis. And being</div><div>A formal employee whose</div><div>Performance is measured at</div><div>Regular intervals. It's the same</div><div>Thing. If you aren't handed a pink</div><div>Slip when you show up for work.</div><div>You have been extended. Haha.</div><div><br></div><div>So she could have extended me.</div><div>Or not extended me. If she extended</div><div>Me. I don't know what would</div><div>Happen. Would she have to buy</div><div>My contract from the staffing</div><div>Agency? And pay some kind</div><div>Of a premium to do so? I have no</div><div>Idea.</div><div><br></div><div>1010</div><div><br></div><div>I don't know what the extension</div><div>Decisions would be. If she would</div><div>Have been forced to decide whether</div><div>Or not to keep me on a contract</div><div>Basis indefinitely. Or decide to</div><div>Make me a formal employee of the</div><div>OTA. I have no idea. Really no idea.</div><div><br></div><div>And maybe that is where the issue</div><div>Arose. Maybe the issue was that</div><div>She had to decide whether or not</div><div>To formalize my employment or</div><div>Not. She may have wanted to</div><div>Extend. But could not formalize</div><div>My employment for whatever</div><div>Reason. And maybe formalizing</div><div>Was the only way to extend.</div><div><br></div><div>1011</div><div><br></div><div>So basically. Maybe she wanted to</div><div>Extend. But not formalize. Since</div><div>She could not extend without</div><div>Formalizing. She therefore could</div><div>Not extend. So she decided not</div><div>To extend. And maybe that was it.</div><div><br></div><div>1012</div><div><br></div><div>By Chestnut ï¹  Hazel at January 19, 2019 [but there are things that you need to know]</div><div>[I wanted to telly you that I really enjoy] &lt;/p&gt; [maybe you would be an incredible person]</div><div>[having you around and maybe] .[iwould].[tellyou].

Not sure what to do.</div><div><br></div><div>The order that I did get was somewhat&nbsp;</div><div>accidental, I was toggling between per&nbsp;</div><div>order and per hours just to check it out,&nbsp;</div><div>and the order I got was a per hour order.</div><div><br></div><div>and I'm thinking, it might make sense to switch&nbsp;</div><div>between the two during certain times of the day.&nbsp;</div><div>The traffic was really bad in whatever area I was in.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway. I called it a day after trying for 3 hours,&nbsp;</div><div>and only getting one order. Some days are better than&nbsp;</div><div>others, and I think. on days where it seems like slim&nbsp;</div><div>pickings, it might make sense to just go back home and&nbsp;</div><div>work on something else.</div><div><br></div><div>1083</div><div><br></div><div>i kind of said that this&nbsp;</div><div>was where it all went south</div><div>where my fingers went</div><div>south where my lips went</div><div>south where everything went</div><div>south even my lips went south</div><div>and all my thoughts went south</div><div>and my hands went south.</div><div><br></div><div>1084</div><div><br></div><div>I deleted my facebook, instagram,&nbsp;</div><div>twitter (X), and linkedin accounts.&nbsp;</div><div>I also think that deleted a number of&nbsp;</div><div>other social media accounts as well,&nbsp;</div><div>Pinterest. I'm not sure I really used&nbsp;</div><div>that account.</div><div><br></div><div>One of the things that sometimes worried&nbsp;</div><div>me about using. one of the things that&nbsp;</div><div>often worried me about deleting these&nbsp;</div><div>accounts is that. Maybe. someone might&nbsp;</div><div>create a fake account using my name and&nbsp;</div><div>all that. I don't know. I won't worry&nbsp;</div><div>about that right now. I'm honestly. really.&nbsp;</div><div>I'm surprised how many other Ken Yamat, and&nbsp;</div><div>kenneth Yamat profiles are out there. I guess&nbsp;</div><div>my name isn't all that special after all.</div><div><br></div><div>there was a change&nbsp;</div><div>of plans the other day</div><div>and a kind of change</div><div>of ideas and a change of mindsets</div><div><br></div><div>and this is what happened</div><div>it was amazing it was really</div><div>fabulous everything changed</div><div><br></div><div>for the&nbsp;</div><div>better no kidding!</div><div><br></div><div>1085</div><div><br></div><div>There</div><div>are no words to&nbsp;</div><div>describe</div><div>the agony of</div><div>eating too much</div><div>food at the buffet</div><div>when you go to</div><div>the buffet&nbsp;</div><div>and eat all&nbsp;</div><div>that you can eat.</div><div><br></div><div>it was something else</div><div>it was really something</div><div>else out there it was</div><div><br></div><div>really amazing it was</div><div>really a sight to see</div><div><br></div><div>I can't even tell you</div><div>what the heck I saw</div><div>because it was so</div><div>indescribably.</div><div><br></div><div>i can't even put it into words.</div><div>I really can't!</div><div><br></div><div>1086</div><div><br></div><div>if it wasn't really</div><div>all that amazing then</div><div>maybe you can tell me</div><div><br></div><div>what exactly you</div><div>were thinking about&nbsp;</div><div>and what exactly&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>you were wondering about</div><div>and what exactly</div><div>you were thinking</div><div><br></div><div>was the worse of the</div><div>two evils!

For me, I was looking for a second job, but I already had&nbsp;</div><div>a second job, and I think, most employers aren't too open to any given&nbsp;</div><div>employee having two job and all that, at least, not for very long anyway.&nbsp;</div><div>Anyway, about the old friend, I asked him what the issue was, and he said&nbsp;</div><div>he said something, and I said to him, you know, it's funny that you should&nbsp;</div><div>say that, because, I happened to be thinking the exact same thing.</div><div><br></div><div>Something like. I remember ordering something like 2 large appetizers,&nbsp;</div><div>they were large enough for 2 people, and, for some reason the waitress asks&nbsp;</div><div>if I want an entrÃ©e anyway. So I ordered one, but I was already really stuffed.&nbsp;</div><div>I ate everything, but I really was super stuffed. I didn't know what to do. I was&nbsp;</div><div>stuffed, like a turkey. I'm on thing ice right now. 2 write ups, and now I'm on&nbsp;</div><div>suspension. I'm afraid about the potential for tough times ahead. I'm afraid about&nbsp;</div><div>the future. I want to be at a point where I can say: everything turned out for the best.</div><div><br></div><div>1255</div><div><br></div><div>There were times when things really did get better, and when it seemed&nbsp;</div><div>like I was on the right path. sometimes it feels like a good future is&nbsp;</div><div>so far away, and so far out of reach. and something that will just never&nbsp;</div><div>happen. and something that will just never materialize. and something that&nbsp;</div><div>is just for people who have connections, and something that is just for&nbsp;</div><div>people who have all the right social skills. and sometimes I think that&nbsp;</div><div>maybe I should make more friends. I made one friend, and we exchanged&nbsp;</div><div>contact information. Sometimes friendships go stale by the time I need a&nbsp;</div><div>letter of recommendation. sometimes connections drop by the time I need a&nbsp;</div><div>letter of recommendation.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Coincidences skill seem to pop up from time to time, and sometimes I'm not&nbsp;</div><div>really sure what to make of them. Sometimes there is this thing or that thing&nbsp;</div><div>and some connection between the two, and I don't really even want to go into&nbsp;</div><div>details, I really don't even want to get into the specifics of this or that&nbsp;</div><div>thing. I just don't. I really don't. When she says that coincidence makes&nbsp;</div><div>sense only with you, what I wonder is does she mean the coincidence seems&nbsp;</div><div>to make sense only when someone, whoever she is talking to, explains the&nbsp;</div><div>coincidence as more than a coincidence, or does she mean, that the person&nbsp;</div><div>who she is talking to is able to accept a coincidence as a coincidence without&nbsp;</div><div>thinking more of it. two thirty two. ninety six. four four three.

I'm not feeling okay at&nbsp;</div><div>all. Things are not going well. I was kind of making&nbsp;</div><div>a little bit of progress not too long ago, but now, I&nbsp;</div><div>think I'll be facing kind of a set back. Nightmare.&nbsp;</div><div>over and over. I'm not happy. I'm unhappy. Everything&nbsp;</div><div>is kind of a disaster. Everything is kind of a nightmare.&nbsp;</div><div>The clock is officially ticking, and I have no idea what&nbsp;</div><div>on earth to do. I feel like pure garbage.</div><div><br></div><div>1258</div><div><br></div><div>everything that everyone does. is really nice. and irritating.</div><div>I left work early. again. and again it wasn't really a good idea.&nbsp;</div><div>not the end of the world. but not a good idea. I'm just not really&nbsp;</div><div>feeling happy. I feel like pure garbage. I'm just in a persistent&nbsp;</div><div>unhappy mood. With all the time I've missed I might as well have&nbsp;</div><div>gone on another road trip. When I looked at my time card I didn't&nbsp;</div><div>realize that I left so early. I thought I worked 2 hours at least,&nbsp;</div><div>but, it was really only an hour an a half. I drink so many energy&nbsp;</div><div>drinks every day. I don't know why I'm in such a bad mood all the&nbsp;</div><div>time. I'm either angry, or depressed. over and over in circles.</div><div><br></div><div>1259</div><div><br></div><div>Feeling lost. I have no idea what to do. I kind of want to go back to&nbsp;</div><div>college. One of the few things that I enjoy is the Software and Web&nbsp;</div><div>Development course that I'm taking, it's expensive, and I don't really&nbsp;</div><div>think I'd be doing this unless it was an employer paid benefit, but I&nbsp;</div><div>think I kind of want to check out what's offered at one of the community&nbsp;</div><div>or junior colleges in Las Vegas.</div><div><br></div><div>So even if I'm somehow able to work through all my remaining shifts for&nbsp;</div><div>the week, it will only put me at about 31 or 32 hours worked for the week.&nbsp;</div><div>Huge mistake to cut out of work, but, sometimes my brain, my mood, just&nbsp;</div><div>has to get away. I couldn't concentrate during class, and I'm having trouble&nbsp;</div><div>concentrating now.</div><div><br></div><div>1260</div><div><br></div><div>there have been. things that were. all amazing.</div><div>there was nice things between the oranges laying&nbsp;</div><div>on the porker such a porker and I thought she was&nbsp;</div><div>a total porker. such a porker. such a total porker.</div><div><br></div><div>Some things are just too weird. some coincidences&nbsp;</div><div>are just too coincidental. sometimes things line up&nbsp;</div><div>in strange ways that seem. weird. like i wonder how&nbsp;</div><div>that happened.

I&nbsp;</div><div>don't know what the specific cause of the issue was, but as far as&nbsp;</div><div>I can tell, it had something to do with the email address that I used&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>to sign up for an account. It's less likely to get flagged if you use&nbsp;</div><div>something like a signup with a Gmail account. So that's what I did,&nbsp;</div><div>the other issue may have been with my account name, which had hyphens.&nbsp;</div><div>and it was really long as well.</div><div><br></div><div>1266</div><div><br></div><div>there are no things. that can be the best. that can tell all.</div><div>when she opened her legs I saw everything I really needed to see.</div><div><br></div><div>I've been wasting a little bit of time playing Sim City.
