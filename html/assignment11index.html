    What’s cooler than link tags? Styled link tags!
    this project might look much less complex than <br>
    what I've beenw working on over the last few weeks <br>
    but this excersize has to do more with managing page and site <br>
    assets more so than the visual design <br>
    this was written in codio, and the codepen version <br>
    is actually just an iframe of the codio version <br>
    IN ANY CASE: you may remember that zelda will conquer <br>
    the known world and when <br>
    link saves her she will be <br>
    a princess of the greatest size <br>
  Link tags are so cool and can be used for so many things. <br>
  especially things related to class work and homework and coursework <br>
  in general <br>They make my life
  so much easier! Once I learn this I can link <br>all of my stylesheets to make sure
  my website looks amazing! <br> So be amazing and take a class with Correlation One <br></p>
