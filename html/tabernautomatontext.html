    Greetings!

    <p>I'm working on it! you will soon see an image of autonomous vending machines!</p>
    
    <p>Tabernautomaton: autonomous ghost kitchen food trucks</p>
    
    <p>autonomous ghost kitchen food trucks that operate like 
    a fleet of motherships and dropships</p>
    
    <p>autonomous ghost kitchen food trucks that operate like 
    a fleet of motherships and dropships, <br>the idea is to address 
    the lack of agility and lack of geographic coverage that existing 
    ghost kitchens face as well as the long trip back problem that 
    human delivery workers face when working in sparsely populated suburbs</p>
    
    It's a system that I would find personally useful.
    
    create a system of autonomous food trucks, drone delivery, ghost kitchens
