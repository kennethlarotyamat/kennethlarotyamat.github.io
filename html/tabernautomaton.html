Greetings!

I'm working on it! you will soon see an image of autonomous vending machines!

Tabernautomaton: autonomous ghost kitchen food trucks

autonomous ghost kitchen food trucks that operate like 
a fleet of motherships and dropships

autonomous ghost kitchen food trucks that operate like 
a fleet of motherships and dropships, the idea is to address 
the lack of agility and lack of geographic coverage that existing 
ghost kitchens face as well as the long trip back problem that 
human delivery workers face when working in sparsely populated suburbs

It's a system that I would find personally useful.

create a system of autonomous food trucks, drone delivery, ghost kitchens 
synthesize a system invlocing autonomous food trucks, drone delivery, ghost kitchens
