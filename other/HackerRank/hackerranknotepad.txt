[ I have an idea, and my idea is to use my carousel project, repurpose it, and use it to display my answers.]
[but there was something else too, I need to figure out how to make it scrollable.]

[I'm tired and I'm going to come back around to this my expectation is that this shouldn't be too hard]
[considering that i've already done 2 seperate ones.]
