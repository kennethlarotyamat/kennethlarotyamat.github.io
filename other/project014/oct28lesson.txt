2. What is a JSON file?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a file format that is easily readable for a human and requires less formatting. 
It is used for sharing or transmitting data to store. The extension of this type of file is .JSON and it is supported 
by many modern programming languages.
The media type used for JSON is application/json.
JSON File Structure
JSON is structured with key and value pairs. The key is unique and is a string surrounded by double quotation marks. 
The Value can be a Number, string (surrounded by double quotation marks), Array, Boolean, null and object. The key and 
value are separated by a colon(:) in the middle with the key on the left and the value on the right. Different key/value 
pairs are separated by a comma(,).

Exercise 3
Build a JSON file for the data below (hint: think of this as a user object).
Name	        Id	            Telephone number	    Hobbies	            Lessons
Christopher	    7464839	    +1457938740	            Read, Sing, Dance	Name:HTML, ID:1; Name:Javascript, ID:2; Name:API; ID:3

...

{"user" : {"name" : "Joseph", "age" : 34, "genre" : null}}

{"Name" : "Christopher", "Id" : 7464839, "TelephoneNumber" : +1457938740, "Hobbies" : ["Read, Sing, Dance"], "Lessons" [{"Name":"HTML", "ID":1}{"Name":"Javascript", "ID":2 }{"Name":"API", "ID":3}] }

1. Accessing APIs with Fetch
javascript fetch api
Goals
By the end of this lesson you will:
Know how to work with the fetch method
Be able to get data using the fetch method
Be able to execute a public free API
Introduction
The fetch() method easily connects the server to the client. You need only type the URL of the API and a second 
parameter for POST requests. With the fetch() method you can execute an API (if you have access) and begin to 
interact a little more with APIs to see an API in action. Also, the fetch() method allows you to get data and show it on your page.

completed this stuff that day, and in retrospect, I should have just done this stuff on Saturday.

I'm going to take a short break.
