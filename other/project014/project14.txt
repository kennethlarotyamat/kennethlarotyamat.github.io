1. Project

Communicating on the Web

For this project, you will be adding something we’ve studied this week to your personal web page. This makes the code yours, 
and can be an example of your knowledge. There doesn’t necessarily have to be a purpose for what you choose to add; in some 
ways you simply want to show off your skills to a potential employer. Choose from:

Leaflet

Asynchronous functions

Collect form information in json format

Google Maps

Whatever you choose, be sure to have clear comments in your code so a reviewer can understand what you did, and also so you can 
go back a month or more later and be reminded of what your thought process was.
When finished, submit your code!

Submission steps:

Before you click on "Mark as Completed":

You need to do one of the following: either upload all of your files to Codio or deploy a GitHub Page for this project.
Also, if you mark this project as complete but any of the boxes are blank, your TA will be unable to grade your project.

Codio upload:

Make sure all of your project code has been uploaded to Codio.
If you did not write your code in Codio, you will need to import all of the required files into your workspace file tree.
You can do this by going to File => Upload Files, and either manually importing each file, or dragging and dropping your project folder.
Please refer to this video if you are unsure of what to do.

GitHub Pages:

If you would rather upload your project to GitHub, please make sure to have the project deployed as a GitHub page 
so we can thoroughly test it. If you are unsure of how to do this, please follow these instructions.
It is important to understand you will need to make a separate repository for every project. You cannot deploy multiple 
pages from the same repository, even with different branches.
Also, no matter whether you uploaded your files from your computer or not, make sure to thoroughly test your code! This 
only takes a few minutes, but will prevent the amount of resubmissions because you missed something.

Communicating on the Web: HTTP/HTTPS, APIs, Async 1 - Thursday, October 26

In the first lesson you will understand what Synchronous means, understand what Asynchronous means, 
and build Asynchronous functions with JavaScript. In the second lesson you will understand Javascript 
Promises, learn how use Javascript Promises, and know the benefits of Javascript Promises. In the third 
lesson you will understand how an API works, know its different architectures, and create your own API.

I'm going to rule out working on a Leafelet or a Google Maps project for Project 14

[Collect form information in json format]

This seems like the best option because we've come across these before, so, I might be more 
familar with them, the other stuff is newer. In fact, I think that I was going to use a json file 
for project 12, but I think I put that off.
