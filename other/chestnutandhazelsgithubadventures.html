  <p>Adventure # 11 - 10/15/2023 05:03</p>

  <p>I need to get a smog check, and then I can renew my vehicle registration, my registration expired yesterday, so I had to pay
    for a temporary moving permit. Headache. I was playing Rome Total War 2 earlier, but, the game froze so I had to force a restart, and 
    at this point I'm no longer really in the mood to play that game.
  </p>
  <p>So I got all that vehicle registration stuff done. Smog Check and payment and all that. It was about 220 all together. 
    
    It wasn't unexpected, but it was something I didn't really budget for. This is irritating because I don't really have
    any money coming in. Getting paid out on my unemployment claim is almost hopeless at this point. What else do I need to do? Is there anything else
  that I can do today? Is there anything else that needs to be done today?</p>

  <p>I think about that scene in The Fifth Element where Zorg says:"Fire One-Million," and he's doing this in an effort to tame inflation, and firiing 
    one-million is in contrast to firiing five-hundred thousand. but. I think that if the Fifth Element were more "Space Odyssey" and Less "Star Wars"
    Zorg would be increasing interest rates by 1 percent, in contrast to increasing interest rates by half a percent.
  </p> <p>I also think that it's less likely that layoff notices would be sent out, and you know, instead it would be something like
     Korben Dallas finding his 
    workplace becoming a high-attrition environment.</p>


<p>...</p>
  <p>Adventure # 10 - 10/14/2023 15:07</p>

  <p>is there something I should be doing today? If there is, I have no idea what it is.
So, okay, here's what I have to do, I have to apply as a non-degree seeking student for Spring 2024,
and take the math class, I've completed the non-degree seeking application.
  </p>

  <p>I have to renew the registration for my car. The website is down, and this is kind of a headache. 
    I probably would have dealt with this sooner if I had received notice sooner, but, here it is, today.</p>

  <p>One of my classmates asked me for help on an older project that she was catching up on. I sent her a link to my GitHub link to that particularl
    project, but realized that she might not be using GitHub yet. So I created a CodePen version of project 10 created specificially for Codepen. I created
    a Project 10 for display on CodePen, but that was just the GitHub version iframed into CodePen, but for the new project 10 version in codepen, I cloned
    the actual code from GitHub and put it into a CodePen Pen, it didn't work at first, so I had to change the iframe slider to reference my older Codepen Project Specifically.
  </p>

  <p>I'm not sure if that's really well explained, but, things are referenced differently in CodePen such that, it really doesn't 
    work well unless I use absolute references, and in many cases, not all references work well.

  There are times when butter is in fact the answer, but the circumstances where butter is the answer are rare. Suppose you're taking a multiple choice test and the question is: what's the answer? If the choices include: A) butter . Well, then it's possible that butter is the answer.</p>

    <p>I don't know what to do right now. Is there someting that I should be doing? Well, I was working on my Blog, this blog, and I was trying to break things up into paragraphs, and make some other changes. I tried to get Transform to work for list items, but, I don't know, I'll get back around to that one.

    </p>

    <p>I also tried to put a link to this blog on my GitHub landing page, I couldn't seem to get it to look how I wanted it to, or, how I imagined I wanted it to look. What I really wanted was for the bottom button to span the whole row I don't know what I'm doing wrong here. I think that it looks fine the way it is, but it's not what I was really thinking.</p>

<p>Note added on 10/14/2023 02:45 AM

I've gotten a notice that I need to fix this blog post, there is something wrong where it is being indexed incorrectly or something, and it's difficult for search engines to crawl this page. I'm not sure what to do
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>So, I just need to focus on getting through the course that I'm already taking. This turned out to be a really good
  program and I'm really pleased that I decided to take it. So, for UNLV, I have to take a calculus class for the Spring 2024 Semester,
  which I'm thinking is going to be the second semester calculus class, since I had taken the first semester of calculus several
  years ago. I have to get a B in that class. I'm wanting, and I'm hoping that I can take this class online.

    <p>Adventure # 7 - 10/13/2023 12:28</p>

    <p>
      
      Alright, so what are we looking at here, um SPLG. it's almost 4:00 PM Eastern Time, 
      so I guess this is basically what happened today. A total of 13 of my limit buys were 
      excecuted, and a total of 4 of my limit sell orders were excecuted, so I ended up buying 7 more shares than I sold.
<br>
     <p> This isn't a big deal or anything because SPLG is a long term position for me, and I'm always happy to have more
      shares of SPLG, but that not really what I'm trying to accomplish here.</p>
      <p>The goal is to end the day with the same number of shares bought as shares sold. so any time I have too many
        extra shares bought or too many extra shares sold, then that means I didn't predict the trading range for that day correctly.
      </p>
    
    
    
    </p>

    <img src="..\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 123333.png" alt="Stock Charge of Ticker Symbol SPLG">
<br><br>
    <img src="..\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 123807.png" alt="Trades Place for Ticker Symbol SPLG">

    <p>Okay, so let's try again for Monday. My best guess is that SPLG will be between 50.20 and 50.83, see chart below.</p> 

    <img src="..\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 130204.png" alt="Stock Charge of Ticker Symbol SPLG">

    <p>I'll place 2 orders, one in each direction.</p>
    <img src="..\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 130723.png" alt="Trades Place for Ticker Symbol SPLG">

    <p>So we will see how that goes. The goal for tomorrow is to have two shares bought, and two shares sold. Or, well, since I have so many outstanding orders at this point, to have the same number of buy orders excecuted as sell orders.</p>
    <p>Anyway, the reason why I'm only doing 1 share at a time, usually I do 10, is because I really screwed up on 10/05/2023 and sold about 70 more shares than I bought, which really threw everything off. In the following days I ended up selling 207 more shares than I wanted to, so I'm at the point of, you know, I basically gotta keep this at 1 share at a time until I'm back at my goal of getting those 207 shares back, and, even though I accumulated 7 more shares than I wanted too today, that accumulation really doesn't count because I want those 207 shares back at 49.90, and not higher.</p>

    <p>and 49.90 is still, you know, in the realm of possibility, in fact, I couldn't find a reason to buy back in at higher than 49.90, even
      after 4 green days because, at no point did there seem to be confirmation of a trend change, or, at least I don't seem to see anything. Maybe if it hit above 51.66, but, I probably still would have waited out even if it did hit 51.66.
    </p>
    <img src="..\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 133205.png" alt="Stock Charge of Ticker Symbol SPLG">
    <p>Anyway, that last chart was a lot to look at. I went to UNLV today to have the meeting with the MSQF Program Director. 
      From the conversation it seems clear that I won't be admitted to the program for the Spring Semester of 2024, I could 
      go to UNLV for Spring 2024, but, only to take a prerequisite course. and then I can get into the program for Fall 2024. 
    This is one of those times where I really hope that I can take this course online.</p>
    <p>Otherwise than that, I'm really tired. I'm worried though. The reason I was shooting for a Spring 2024 admission is because
      there are so many things can go wrong between now and January, and, there are even more things that can go wrong between now and August 2024.
      you know, and, this is just another nightmare.
    </p>
    <div><p>

      <p>...</p>
  Adventure # 6 - 10/12/2023 20:47</p><p>
  
  I am exhausted. I have a meeting tomorrow regarding admission to UNLV. I have to figure this out. It's not
  clear to me what we will be discussing. I don't know how many times I've sent transcripts and submitted
  applications to UNLV, and all that.
  
  I don't know what's on my mind exactly. I'm tired. Going back to work for those two weeks or whatever. It made
  me realize that. I don't know. Like. Working in a factory or a warehouse is going to be just another dead end.
  It's never really gone anywhere, and, as far as I can tell, it's not really going to go anywhere.
  
  I remember going into one interview recently and, there was this kind of weird moment where, the interviewer
  seemed to. Well, she stated that she was looking for someone who was looking to stay with the organization for
  the next 20 years or something. and I was thinking. I was thinking later, but. do I really plan 20 years ahead?
  do I have a 20 year plan? because I already know that I don't have a 20 year plan, but if I did have a 20 year plan
  or, something. I sure as hell wouldn't be interviewing for your company.
  
  you know.
  
  if I have to plan for the next 20 years, the most obvious thing to do is not to work for some company that I don't
  see myself working at for 20 years. you know. like I don't really see myself working there for 20 years, or even 2 years.
  
  You know. There isn't a single company that I've ever worked for, or that I've ever applied for, that I really saw myself
  working at for 20 years.
  
  I mean the most obvious thing to do, if I'm planning for the next 20 years. is. to go back to college. develop some
  new skill or whatever.

  <p><p>...</p>
  Adventure # 5 - 10/12/2023 02:48</p><p>
  
  So what am I thinking about right now. I got sidetracked from putting down my thoughts for Adventure # 4. Well.
  I don't know. I tend to be bombarded with stuff. Various stuffs. Various things. This or that. Whatever. I started
  obsessing over the color of the buttons on my landing page. made a little bit of progress. realized I don't know
  jack about javascript. figured I'd get around to it later. and then I started 
  obsessing over my project carousel. so that's basically what happened. I'm tying to recollect about what happend 
  yesterday, and the things I'm thinking about for the next couple days. The forseeable future, which as of right now.
  can be measured only. in days.
  
  I got sidetracked yet again. I don't know where I was.
  
  Quam pulchra es sicut ibi stabat Qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet consectetur 
  ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem Quae te dementia cepit Forsan et 
  haec olim meminisse juvabit Militat omnis amans  omnia vincit amor  
  
  I got sidetracked yet again. The above text should read something like 
  How beautiful you are standing there! who gullibly believes you are everything? who seeks pain to derive some pleasure from pain? What madness
  posesses you? We will remember this fondly: every lover is a fighter: Love conquers all.
  
  This is basically just a collage of different latin quotes. Famous ones. including the most famous latin text of all: 
  
  lorem ipsum.
  
  This is supposed to be funny. The most famous latin quote should be omnia vincit amor, love conquers all, but I don't think that it is, i mean, more
  well known than lorem ipsum. the other funny thing is that, delorem ipsum, is from, i guess, cicero, but his most famous line should actually be:
  
  Carthago delenda est
  
  and um, I guess I came across: Militat omnis amans, from Ovid
  which translates to:
  
  every lover
  is
  a fighter
  
  Which is really funny because that's clearly a response to the phrase: "I'm a lover not a fighter." 
  and he does this to omnia vincent amore as well, where he say something like:
  
  Love conquers all? so too will I triumph over love!
  
  but I couldn't find that quote online, or at least, I had a lot of trouble finding it because all searches for
  
  Omnia vincent amore, ovid come up only with virgils original line.
  
  anyway.
  
  I got sidetracked again, I had an ititial version of project 8 that I was having a lot of trouble with, so, I stopped working on it and
  started completely over. There is a screenshot of it in my media folder. I don't know what the issue was. or. I don't remember since project 8
  feels like it was something I did such a long time ago, but whatever it was. I think it was that I was having trouble changing things. so I started with
  a different templete or whatever it's called in wordpress, and deleted more or less everything but the color scheme, and re-did the entire
  thing element by element. so. that's how it went. super easy and I really enjoyed it.
  
  I feel like there was something I'm supposed to do today, but, whatever it is, it's clearly slipped my mind. <br><br>

  Adventure # 4 - 10/11/2023 23:04</p><p>
  
  There are a number of things on my mind, but I'm not sure what to write about first.
  
  I might be able to get into UNLV. I have no idea how many times I've applied there, and for how many
  different programs, but finally getting in would be nice. I feel so bad about dropping out of grad school
  at UTA a year ago, and, if I ever get around to making it up to Yibing Du and Thomas Thompson, I'll reapply 
  at somepoint in the future and get a degree at UTA.
  
  anyway.
  
  I'm glad it's still, only Wednesday, even if, at 23:13, it's pretty much already Thursday. I have a metting with,
  I don't know exactly, the admissions person, or, well, it's critical that I meet with him in order to get into the program.
  
  I'm glad it's still Wednesday.

  One of the issues I have with what I post on chestnutandhazel.com is that It's hosted, or whatever, it's really just an account
  on blogger.com, so since it's basically a social media account, I have to comply with the community guidles of blogger.com, and
  since I have adsense active on that page, I also have to comply with any adsense advertiser standards, so I have my hands tied 
  in many respects. chestnutandhazel.com continues to get flagged over and over and over, and in many cases I don't really want to 
  deal with it right away.
  
  the other issue is that I also have to post what I write somewhere, so that I can use the standard copyright registration form,
  rather than the unpublished copyright registration form, so, that's another issue. so you know, it's kind of whatever.

  on top of the painting of Jack Torrance, and then took pictures of my masterpiece, and then photo edited the result. 
  The paintings are by Vanessa Callanta. what stood out to me about Callanta's Painting "All Work and No Play" was how

  "Salesforce Profile Deletion 1.0012331223122525365456456464554" by Kenneth Larot Yamat
  
  This was my Sales Force profile while working at
  Viator, a company owned by Trip Advisor
  i was paid by Morris and Willner Partners
  not a formal employee of Viator or Trip Advisor
  or professional staffing group
  I really miss working there
  but i was obsessed with my boss Kristin
  i don't think she would ever hire me again
  i used her name and initials as some of my
  passwords and i'm sure it came around to her
  sorry my favorite boss in recent history
  but i really would not want to work for any one else

  Ode I, 5: To Pyrrha
  BY HORACE
  TRANSLATED BY JOHN MILTON
  What slender youth, bedew‚Äôd with liquid odors,
  Courts thee on roses in some pleasant cave,
               Pyrrha? For whom bind‚Äôst thou
               In wreaths thy golden hair,
  Plain in thy neatness? O how oft shall he
  Of faith and changed gods complain, and seas
               Rough with black winds, and storms
               Unwonted shall admire!
  Who now enjoys thee credulous, all gold,
  Who, always vacant, always amiable
               Hopes thee, of flattering gales
               Unmindful. Hapless they
  To whom thou untried seem‚Äôst fair. Me, in my vow‚Äôd
  Picture, the sacred wall declares to have hung
               My dank and dropping weeds
               To the stern god of sea.
  
  ...
  
  Literal English Translation
  What slender boy, drenched in liquid perfumes,
  presses hard upon you on many a rose,
  Pyrrha, under cover of a pleasing cave?
  For whom do you bind back your yellow hair,
   
  Simple with elegance? Alas, how often will he lament
  faithlessness and changed gods, and in surprise
  He will marvel at
  rough waters with black winds,
   
  he who now enjoys you, believing, you are golden,
  who hopes that you will be always free, always lovable,
  he who is ignorant of the treacherous breeze!
  Wretched are they for whom
   
  you, untried, shine. As for me, the sacred wall
  with its votive tablet declares that I have
  hung up my dripping garments
  to the god who rules over the sea.
  
  ...
  
  Original Latin
  
  quis multa gracilis te puer in rosa
    perfusus liquidis urget odoribus
        grato, Pyrrha, sub antro?
          cui flavam religas comam,
  
  simplex munditiis? heu quotiens fidem
    mutatosque deos flebit et aspera
        nigris aequora ventis
           emirabitur insolens,
  
    qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea,
  qui semper vacuam, semper amabilem
        sperat, nescius aurae
           fallacis! miseri, quibus
  
    intemptata nites. me tabula sacer
    votiva paries indicat uvida
      suspendisse potenti
           vestimenta maris deo.

  Adventure # 2 - 10/10/2023 20:41</p><p>
  
  I'm more tired than ever. More than I can possibly imagine. Today was a long day. Small victories I guess.
  </p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>
  Adventure # 1 - 10/10/2023 10:48</p><p>
  
  I consider this published, even if it's unlikley anyone will come across this
  or read it. There are times when I want to write things, but, less and less I feel
  the desire to write them on chestnutandhazel.com I don't know what it is, but, I'm
  starting to feel more "On Stage" when I write and post things there.
  
  Maybe a few years back it seemed, it felt like there wasn't anyone really, you know
  reading it.
  
  I need to be working on Project 11, but for some reason I'm just not really getting anything done.
  I've managed to figure out where my Contact Form is. It's something that I haven't really messed with
  in a while, but Project 11 entails messing with it. So. That's what I'm up to.
  
  There's a lot of cleaning up that needs to be done with the index page of my Github Repository,
  and a lot of that cleaning up, with the code, cleaning up the appearance of my code wouldn't
  really change the outward appearance of my page. It would just make it easier to change things around
  but, considering that the course is almost over, I'm not really sure how much it makes sense to really
  do anything about it.
  
  I really have to get Project 11 done. I was reviewing the recording of the class session, and
  it looks easy, and, I remember it being easy when I was doing it. I don't remember, but I 
  think that I napped through part of the class, and came back around to it later.
  
  One of the things about the class is that, I'm much more open to distance learning, or online coursework, or virtual classrooms,
  or whatever, now that I've done it, back in 2018 or 2019 I think that I was really skeptical about it, and
  I kind of brushed off a recruiter for an online degree program, but um, I think that I'm more open to it now.
  
  I tried to get the favicon to work on GitHub, but, I can't seem to figure it out, and, since it's not an assignment,
  I really didn't pursue the thing past the point of absolute frustration.
  
  The favicon is more vanity than any kind of practical kind of a thing. Like I don't have a practical reason for setting 
  up the favicon on GitHub other than the desire to have one.
  
  I'm exhausted, and I really haven't done anything for project 11 yet.
  I want to take a nap, but, that's a little bit of a risk considering that it's due today.
  and, I really have to get to it because, in all probability, it's something that can be done in an hour or two, at most.
  I'm so tired. I want to get a soda.
  
           
           
           
           
  
  
           I don't know what to do about CodePen. Migrating things to github is a small nightmare.
           
            <!-- 10102023 0423 form input validation project 11 -->
            <!-- 10102023 0442 form input validation project 11 -->

            <!-- found those mozerella sticks, they were on linkedin, don't use linkedin to host images. they break after a while -->
            <!-- Spent nearly an hour updating chestnut and hazel hamburgers, an assignment from way early in the course the image links broke -->

            <!-- 10102023 1008 I got sidetracked with a number of other things and I'm still working on this. -->
  
  I'm feeling incredibly scatter brained. I have a project due for my software and web development course today, and I haven't even started. 
  This should be simple, so I'm not too worried about it, but, at the same time, I know from the past that these things could take quite 
  a while if I hit a brick wall.
  
  There are other issues that I'm facing, especially on the income front. The temp assignment was not a particularly good fit, and, I 
  really get the feeling that I should avoid any kind of warehouse or factory work, even though, that's sort of what I've been doing 
  for the past five years, but I don't have the slightest clue what to look for.
  
  Life is such an unbelievable struggle. I don't really know what to do about money. Somewhere in the back of my mind there's 
  this voice telling me that I should stop looking for a job or employment or whatever, and, that I should focus on trying to 
  make money doing stock market shit.

  Reflection # 714 by Chestnut and Hazel
  I don't know exactly what I've been spending on buying lunch and soda at work, 
  but I know that it is too damn much, I want to say it is around 15 dollars per day. 
  Too fucking much. I have to cut down on that for sure.

  Notes written on 10/10/2023 @ 10:19 AM
  
  I think that I wrote this post while I was working at Case New Holland. I'm surprised that I was really spending that much. I 
  Wonder what I was buying? I don't really remember. I think that it was mostly energy drinks. I don't remember my exact hours. 
  It was overnight is as much as I remember. In Cameron, MO there isn't really much to eat if you're up at odd hours.
  
  I'm working on Project 11 for my Web and Software Development course. I'm not really getting much done. I'm getting sidetracked
  with other things. I'm really amazed that I get so little done, especially considering that I've had few other obligations other
  than class these past few months. I really wonder what I've been doing.
  
  Earlier in the course I would have a lot of fun playing around with our daily assignments, but, I haven't really done that in a
  while, even though there have been plenty of opportunities to do so.

  "Clothes 28" by Kenneth Larot Yamat By Chestnut Ôπ† Hazel at January 19, 2019 originally posted at chestnutandhazel.com
  
  I watched two documentaries.
  One on the Sino Japanese war.
  The one that morphed into world
  War 2. And one on the Japanese
  Industrial revolution.
  
  So. I wanted to think about why
  Things ended at the OTA. It's been
  A while. And I think. Deserves some
  Reflection.
  
  Lets say that all decisions can be
  Simplified. That all decisions
  Come to a fork. Bifurcate or
  Whatever. Like. You are faced
  With a decision. And your choices
  Are always two. At first.
  
  Think of this. In a standard road.
  You have two choices when you
  Reach an intersection. You can
  Continue down the road. Or turn.
  Two choices. If you choose to
  Turn. You can choose left or right.
  Two choices. And so on. Some
  Might think of this as three choices.
  You can travel straight. Left. Or right.
  But you can also think of it the way
  I did. Of two choices. One choice
  Having two sub choices.
  
  Which way of thinking is more
  Simple? Which way of thinking is
  Less convoluted? Which way of
  Thinking is cleaner. I have no idea.
  But I think. That bifurcation allows
  Points in the decision making
  Process to be more clearly marked.
  And either way. You can still account
  For all possible decisions.
  
  So back to my former boss at the
  OTA. She could have extended me.
  Or she could have decided not to
  Extend me. We already know what
  Decision she made. But let's figure
  Out what she was thinking.
  
  Now. It didn't bother me that I wasn't
  Formally employed by the OTA.
  Who cares right? Some people do
  Though. Some people do like to
  Be official or whatever.
  
  And I'm not being dismissive
  About the desire to be official.
  I wanted to be official with Ash.
  But she didn't want to be official
  Unless we were super fucking
  Official.
  
  In my thinking though. Even when a
  Person is formally employed. Their
  Continued employment is really
  Just an extension. It just goes by
  A different term. People think of
  It differently. But I don't. People
  Think of it differently because
  Different words are used. But I'd say
  The mechanics of being a contractor
  On an extension basis. And being
  A formal employee whose
  Performance is measured at
  Regular intervals. It's the same
  Thing. If you aren't handed a pink
  Slip when you show up for work.
  You have been extended. Haha.
  
  So she could have extended me.
  Or not extended me. If she extended
  Me. I don't know what would
  Happen. Would she have to buy
  My contract from the staffing
  Agency? And pay some kind
  Of a premium to do so? I have no
  Idea.
  
  I don't know what the extension
  Decisions would be. If she would
  Have been forced to decide whether
  Or not to keep me on a contract
  Basis indefinitely. Or decide to
  Make me a formal employee of the
  OTA. I have no idea. Really no idea.
  
  And maybe that is where the issue
  Arose. Maybe the issue was that
  She had to decide whether or not
  To formalize my employment or
  Not. She may have wanted to
  Extend. But could not formalize
  My employment for whatever
  Reason. And maybe formalizing
  Was the only way to extend.
  
  So basically. Maybe she wanted to
  Extend. But not formalize. Since
  She could not extend without
  Formalizing. She therefore could
  Not extend. So she decided not
  To extend. And maybe that was it.

  I want to say that body language
  Has certain deficiencies. A lack

  Minutia. It has potential for
  Miscommunication. And
  Misinterpretation. It is difficult
  To convey meaning clearly
  Through body language. It
  Is difficult to interpret meaning
  Through body language.
  
  I think of the invention of
  Writing. And why writing is
  Nessecary. It's because. Someone.
  Somewhere. Kept making the wrong
  Facial expressions. Kept making
  The wrong hand gestures and
  Vocal inflections. And said fuck this.
  I will now create writing.

  I know what to do now, like going forward and stuff. I'm going to say this:
  
  
  "Yeah, I know a whole bunch of stuff, all the craziest dirt and everything. Basically. I have all the information you need, even the things that other people don't know, and even the things that other people couldn't even imagine."
  
  maybe you know the things that you haven't
  already learned so you will learn them.
