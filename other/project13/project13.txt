1. Project: Algo Practice & Add to Personal Website
Overview

For Project 13, you will get a little bit of practice tackling coding questions, 
upload the code for your attempts to GitHub, and also add to your website‚Äôs project session!


Step One


Complete the following:

Sign up for free accounts on 
LeetCode, [done]
Hackerrank, and [done]
CodeWars [done]

Create a GitHub repository with 3 folders (one for each of the above platforms), 
and a brief README file with at least 2 sentences describing your repo

[ i really don't want to create a new repository]

[https://github.com/kennethlarotyamat/miscellaneous]

Work on 2 - 3 beginner level challenges from any of the above platforms (or one from each!)
Push all of your code to the GitHub repo you created
Submit a link to your repo and, if it‚Äôs a private repo, add your TA as a collaborator
NOTE: Try your best to solve the coding challenges, using comments to describe the thought 
process behind your approach. You can also ask your TA for help with these. But even if you 
can‚Äôt arrive at a solution that‚Äôs okay! The only requirement for these challenges, in terms 
of this project submission, is that it‚Äôs evident that you employed critical thinking and attempted a solution.
Step Two
Add the calculator mini project (from Lesson 1.3), or another project you completed 
outside of class, to the projects section of your website. The styling is up to you, but 
you should include a screenshot, a title, a brief description, and a link to the code on GitHub. 
Finally, submit the GitHub link below (again, if it‚Äôs a private repo, be sure to add your TA as a collaborator).
Happy coding! üöÄ

The only thing worse than not knowing why some code breaks is not knowing why it worked in the 
first place! It‚Äôs the classic ‚Äúhouse of cards‚Äù mentality: ‚Äúit works, but I‚Äôm not sure why, so nobody 
touch it!‚Äù You may have heard, ‚ÄúHell is other people‚Äù (Sartre), and the programmer meme twist, ‚ÄúHell is other people‚Äôs code.‚Äù
I believe truly: "Hell is not understanding my own code.‚Äù

I usually don't start on a project until the day it's due, but that's lead to challenges. so I'm going to 
at least take a look at it today.

I'm honestly still refining project 12, even though I've already turned it in, and my TA has already graded it.
