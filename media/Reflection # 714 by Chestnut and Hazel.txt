Reflection # 714 by Chestnut and Hazel
I don't know exactly what I've been spending on buying lunch and soda at work, 
but I know that it is too damn much, I want to say it is around 15 dollars per day. 
Too fucking much. I have to cut down on that for sure.

I think that I wrote this post while I was working at Case New Holland. I'm surprised that I was really spending that much. I 
Wonder what I was buying? I don't really remember. I think that it was mostly energy drinks. I don't remember my exact hours. 
It was overnight is as much as I remember. In Cameron, MO there isn't really much to eat if you're up at odd hours.

I'm working on Project 11 for my Web and Software Development course. I'm not really getting much done. I'm getting sidetracked
with other things. I'm really amazed that I get so little done, especially considering that I've had few other obligations other
than class these past few months. I really wonder what I've been doing.

Earlier in the course I would have a lot of fun playing around with our daily assignments, but, I haven't really done that in a
while, even though there have been plenty of opportunities to do so.
