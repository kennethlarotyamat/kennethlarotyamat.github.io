Adventure # 6 - 10/12/2023 20:47

I am exhausted. I have a meeting tomorrow regarding admission to UNLV. I have to figure this out. It's not
clear to me what we will be discussing. I don't know how many times I've sent transcripts and submitted
applications to UNLV, and all that.

Adventure # 5 - 10/12/2023 02:48

So what am I thinking about right now. I got sidetracked from putting down my thoughts for Adventure # 4. Well.
I don't know. I tend to be bombarded with stuff. Various stuffs. Various things. This or that. Whatever. I started
obsessing over the color of the buttons on my landing page. made a little bit of progress. realized I don't know
jack about javascript. figured I'd get around to it later. and then I started 
obsessing over my project carousel. so that's basically what happened. I'm tying to recollect about what happend 
yesterday, and the things I'm thinking about for the next couple days. The forseeable future, which as of right now.
can be measured only. in days.

I got sidetracked yet again. I don't know where I was.

Quam pulchra es sicut ibi stabat Qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet consectetur 
ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem Quae te dementia cepit Forsan et 
haec olim meminisse juvabit Militat omnis amans  omnia vincit amor  

I got sidetracked yet again. The above text should read something like 
How beautiful you are standing there! who gullibly believes you are everything? who seeks pain to derive some pleasure from pain? What madness
posesses you? We will remember this fondly: every lover is a fighter: Love conquers all.

This is basically just a collage of different latin quotes. Famous ones. including the most famous latin text of all: 

lorem ipsum.

This is supposed to be funny. The most famous latin quote should be omnia vincit amor, love conquers all, but I don't think that it is, i mean, more
well known than lorem ipsum. the other funny thing is that, delorem ipsum, is from, i guess, cicero, but his most famous line should actually be:

Carthago delenda est

and um, I guess I came across: Militat omnis amans, from Ovid
which translates to:

every lover
is
a fighter

Which is really funny because that's clearly a response to the phrase: "I'm a lover not a fighter." 
and he does this to omnia vincent amore as well, where he say something like:

Love conquers all? so too will I triumph over love!

but I couldn't find that quote online, or at least, I had a lot of trouble finding it because all searches for

Omnia vincent amore, ovid come up only with virgils original line.

anyway.

I got sidetracked again, I had an ititial version of project 8 that I was having a lot of trouble with, so, I stopped working on it and
started completely over. There is a screenshot of it in my media folder. I don't know what the issue was. or. I don't remember since project 8
feels like it was something I did such a long time ago, but whatever it was. I think it was that I was having trouble changing things. so I started with
a different templete or whatever it's called in wordpress, and deleted more or less everything but the color scheme, and re-did the entire
thing element by element. so. that's how it went. super easy and I really enjoyed it.

I feel like there was something I'm supposed to do today, but, whatever it is, it's clearly slipped my mind.

Adventure # 4 - 10/11/2023 23:04

There are a number of things on my mind, but I'm not sure what to write about first.

I might be able to get into UNLV. I have no idea how many times I've applied there, and for how many
different programs, but finally getting in would be nice. I feel so bad about dropping out of grad school
at UTA a year ago, and, if I ever get around to making it up to Yibing Du and Thomas Thompson, I'll reapply 
at somepoint in the future and get a degree at UTA.

anyway.

I'm glad it's still, only Wednesday, even if, at 23:13, it's pretty much already Thursday. I have a metting with,
I don't know exactly, the admissions person, or, well, it's critical that I meet with him in order to get into the program.

I'm glad it's still Wednesday.

One of the issues I have with what I post on chestnutandhazel.com is that It's hosted, or whatever, it's really just an account
on blogger.com, so since it's basically a social media account, I have to comply with the community guidles of blogger.com, and
since I have adsense active on that page, I also have to comply with any adsense advertiser standards, so I have my hands tied 
in many respects. chestnutandhazel.com continues to get flagged over and over and over, and in many cases I don't really want to 
deal with it right away.

the other issue is that I also have to post what I write somewhere, so that I can use the standard copyright registration form,
rather than the unpublished copyright registration form, so, that's another issue. so you know, it's kind of whatever.

Jekyll & Hyde 2, Kenneth Larot Yamat (2015) digital photography
This is a photograph of a mixed media composition. I took two paintings that I bought by a local artist, put a Zoloft pen 
on top of the painting of Jack Torrance, and then took pictures of my masterpiece, and then photo edited the result. 
The paintings are by Vanessa Callanta. what stood out to me about Callanta's Painting "All Work and No Play" was how 
calm Jack Torrance looked. i think it's the use of blue. Jack Torrance typically wore red shirts in The Shining.

Ode I, 5: To Pyrrha
BY HORACE
TRANSLATED BY JOHN MILTON
What slender youth, bedew’d with liquid odors,
Courts thee on roses in some pleasant cave,
             Pyrrha? For whom bind’st thou
             In wreaths thy golden hair,
Plain in thy neatness? O how oft shall he
Of faith and changed gods complain, and seas
             Rough with black winds, and storms
             Unwonted shall admire!
Who now enjoys thee credulous, all gold,
Who, always vacant, always amiable
             Hopes thee, of flattering gales
             Unmindful. Hapless they
To whom thou untried seem’st fair. Me, in my vow’d
Picture, the sacred wall declares to have hung
             My dank and dropping weeds
             To the stern god of sea.

...

Literal English Translation
What slender boy, drenched in liquid perfumes,
presses hard upon you on many a rose,
Pyrrha, under cover of a pleasing cave?
For whom do you bind back your yellow hair,
 
Simple with elegance? Alas, how often will he lament
faithlessness and changed gods, and in surprise
He will marvel at
rough waters with black winds,
 
he who now enjoys you, believing, you are golden,
who hopes that you will be always free, always lovable,
he who is ignorant of the treacherous breeze!
Wretched are they for whom
 
you, untried, shine. As for me, the sacred wall
with its votive tablet declares that I have
hung up my dripping garments
to the god who rules over the sea.

...

Original Latin

quis multa gracilis te puer in rosa
  perfusus liquidis urget odoribus
      grato, Pyrrha, sub antro?
        cui flavam religas comam,

simplex munditiis? heu quotiens fidem
  mutatosque deos flebit et aspera
      nigris aequora ventis
         emirabitur insolens,

  qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea,
qui semper vacuam, semper amabilem
      sperat, nescius aurae
         fallacis! miseri, quibus

  intemptata nites. me tabula sacer
  votiva paries indicat uvida
    suspendisse potenti
         vestimenta maris deo.

Adventure # 2 - 10/10/2023 20:41

I'm more tired than ever. More than I can possibly imagine. Today was a long day. Small victories I guess.

Adventure # 1 - 10/10/2023 10:48

I consider this published, even if it's unlikley anyone will come across this
or read it. There are times when I want to write things, but, less and less I feel
the desire to write them on chestnutandhazel.com I don't know what it is, but, I'm
starting to feel more "On Stage" when I write and post things there.

Maybe a few years back it seemed, it felt like there wasn't anyone really, you know
reading it.

I need to be working on Project 11, but for some reason I'm just not really getting anything done.
I've managed to figure out where my Contact Form is. It's something that I haven't really messed with
in a while, but Project 11 entails messing with it. So. That's what I'm up to.

There's a lot of cleaning up that needs to be done with the index page of my Github Repository,
and a lot of that cleaning up, with the code, cleaning up the appearance of my code wouldn't
really change the outward appearance of my page. It would just make it easier to change things around
but, considering that the course is almost over, I'm not really sure how much it makes sense to really
do anything about it.

I really have to get Project 11 done. I was reviewing the recording of the class session, and
it looks easy, and, I remember it being easy when I was doing it. I don't remember, but I 
think that I napped through part of the class, and came back around to it later.

One of the things about the class is that, I'm much more open to distance learning, or online coursework, or virtual classrooms,
or whatever, now that I've done it, back in 2018 or 2019 I think that I was really skeptical about it, and
I kind of brushed off a recruiter for an online degree program, but um, I think that I'm more open to it now.

I tried to get the favicon to work on GitHub, but, I can't seem to figure it out, and, since it's not an assignment,
I really didn't pursue the thing past the point of absolute frustration.

The favicon is more vanity than any kind of practical kind of a thing. Like I don't have a practical reason for setting 
up the favicon on GitHub other than the desire to have one.

I'm exhausted, and I really haven't done anything for project 11 yet.
I want to take a nap, but, that's a little bit of a risk considering that it's due today.
and, I really have to get to it because, in all probability, it's something that can be done in an hour or two, at most.
I'm so tired. I want to get a soda.

         
         
         
         


         I don't know what to do about CodePen. Migrating things to github is a small nightmare.
         
          <!-- 10102023 0423 form input validation project 11 -->
          <!-- 10102023 0442 form input validation project 11 -->
          <!-- I can't figure out where those mozzarella sticks are 10102023 0442 form input validation project 11 -->
          <!-- found those mozerella sticks, they were on linkedin, don't use linkedin to host images. they break after a while -->
          <!-- Spent nearly an hour updating chestnut and hazel hamburgers, an assignment from way early in the course the image links broke -->
          <!-- so I had to rehost the images elsewhere and create new links.  anyway back to project 11 10102023 0538-->
          <!-- 10102023 1008 I got sidetracked with a number of other things and I'm still working on this. -->

I'm feeling incredibly scatter brained. I have a project due for my software and web development course today, and I haven't even started. 
This should be simple, so I'm not too worried about it, but, at the same time, I know from the past that these things could take quite 
a while if I hit a brick wall.

There are other issues that I'm facing, especially on the income front. The temp assignment was not a particularly good fit, and, I 
really get the feeling that I should avoid any kind of warehouse or factory work, even though, that's sort of what I've been doing 
for the past five years, but I don't have the slightest clue what to look for.

Life is such an unbelievable struggle. I don't really know what to do about money. Somewhere in the back of my mind there's 
this voice telling me that I should stop looking for a job or employment or whatever, and, that I should focus on trying to 
make money doing stock market shit.

Reflection # 714 by Chestnut and Hazel
I don't know exactly what I've been spending on buying lunch and soda at work, 
but I know that it is too damn much, I want to say it is around 15 dollars per day. 
Too fucking much. I have to cut down on that for sure.
By Chestnut + Hazel at June 11, 2019 

Notes written on 10/10/2023 @ 10:19 AM

I think that I wrote this post while I was working at Case New Holland. I'm surprised that I was really spending that much. I 
Wonder what I was buying? I don't really remember. I think that it was mostly energy drinks. I don't remember my exact hours. 
It was overnight is as much as I remember. In Cameron, MO there isn't really much to eat if you're up at odd hours.

I'm working on Project 11 for my Web and Software Development course. I'm not really getting much done. I'm getting sidetracked
with other things. I'm really amazed that I get so little done, especially considering that I've had few other obligations other
than class these past few months. I really wonder what I've been doing.

Earlier in the course I would have a lot of fun playing around with our daily assignments, but, I haven't really done that in a
while, even though there have been plenty of opportunities to do so.
