I don't know where else to write this. I could write it on my GitHub page, but I kind of screwed up that page while reorganizing things, so I'll just write it here.

I'm applying for a number of programs as UNLV: the MFA Creative Writing Program, the MS Quantitative Finance Program, and the MS Computer Science program.

I didn't realize this until just now: each program has a different due date, the MFA application is due first, or earliest or whatever, in January.

They are all of the Fall semester of 2024. I have to get the MFA application ready before January. I wrote one poem recently, and I really can't 
remember the last time I wrote one:

"The Young Woman who is the Post Office" (2022)

The rural carrier associate is a 
young woman with a lisp that lingers
long enough to wreck your week, and
fiery jade eyes that burn in your
mind every subsequent week.

I try to buy stamps, twenty is too much for
one stamp, and she can't break bills, and
I can't have them all, I ask to trade stamps,
one for one, she's not sure that's okay,
so she phones a friend; she asks
if I have exact change and I say:
yes! I do.

"This Is Just To Say Something About The Young Housewife" (2023)

I totally ate all of the  so many    fried turkeys
that were hanging out
by the red wheelbarrow
you know     the one glazed with
soy sauce and beside the 
                      kentucky fried 
                             kung pao chickens
           which 
themselves were drenched in
              tabasco sauce

I request neither forgiveness
nor do I intend to apologize for
          my actions 

because 

I spent several hours
of quality time
with a certain young housewife

                    who

braless and dressed in negligee 

          and 

whose wild hair suggested
she spent even more additional
even higher quality time with
both the ice man
and the fish man

       either sequentially 
               or 
              simultaneously 
                     neither would surprise me

left me    breathless    exhausted
as well as      famished

I thought I gave a good
account of myself

but then along came 
          the milkman
and    she             still
   had enough energy 
       for 
    round four

I was there
I saw it all

I'm tired. What do I have due today? I have a few class assignments and a Project due. I've been working on 
the project for days, and I've had a really hard time with it. I'll insert a few iframes below.

5

anyway, I'm kind of lost and don't really know what to do, i need to go over this course material. I don't know why this most 
recent project has monopolized my time. I got tied down with front-end 
aspects that had almost nothing to do with the assignment, and I'm irritated about it.

My new restart version of project 14 did not go as well as I thought it would have gone. I don't know what to do. I'm in a bad mood. 

There are two things that I'm thinking about doing, forking project 14 version 2 to start project 14 version 3, making one more attempt 
at the iframe carousel, and then getting the JSON and asynchronous stuff into project 14.

the other idea is going back to project 14 version 1 and just shoving the 2 additional things into it, it's a mess, but it works, 
and the cleaner version 2 doesn't work.

Irritated.

6

i'm in class right now, and all this new material is going way over my head. I'm tired, and I haven't paid attention in class in weeks. 
most of the time I'm in class trying to figure out past assignments.

7

my nails are. and I swore I just cut them, but they are long enough to be interfering with my ability to type.

8

do I have any money?

9

I'm a little bit lost right now.

10

I'm trying to think. There are a number of things I need to get done today.
I finished project 14, there were a lot of things that I wanted to do with
it, but, I ended up just going with the leaflet integration option, and
even doing that took a mountain of time. I integrated leaflet to my
Hamburgers project, and Connections for Mobile assignment.

I have a few class assignments, and I also have
some kind of professional development project that I have to
do.

and
I think that might be it.

originally founded as the DM Literary Review.

<!-- check for deployment after a while. this was moved from codepen into vscode and uploaded to GitHub to make this function better.
I really want to update this, maybe even change the look of it. -->

16

I think this was about my chestnut + hazel connections page for project 14.

17

I'm uploading content to my YouTube channel, I'm not sure how exciting these videos are. 
some of these videos are very long, and take a long time to upload as well, and I can't really upload all of them at once because 
my account doesn't have those permissions just yet.

18

my nails aren't that long, but I had to cut them because they are messing with my ability to type again.

I really don't know what to do about money.

Even with as much time as I've spent on this, and seemingly no closer to getting a JSON file working, I seem to have
made a breakthrough with this carousel. The iframes look like they are interactive in a way that they were not interactive
in the original Project 10 version of the carousel.

I'm setting up links to see if the iframes in the carousel work, and if they do, then that means this should work. and I can
get project 14 completed, even though this seems like it was kind of a long digression from the requirements of project 14.

-->

21

I'm spending some time today to work on my blog, as well as my YouTube channel. 
I don't know. I need to do something with these gaming videos, like add 
narration, or, say something, about what I'm thinking, about what some of my 
decisions are when I'm playing. I'm kind of thinking of going with the Vanilla 
version, rather than playing with so many mods, but, if there isn't one annoying 
issue with the game, there is usually some other annoying issue. One thing 
that takes up a lot more time than I would like it to, is the whole business of 
managing the faction and ruling dynasty.

22

This is one of my earlier videos from the channel, when I spent time reading poetry and all of that. It's interesting to see all of the voice over stuff 
that can be done with text to speech programs. I actually saw an advertisement for one that I was really impressed with.

I don't know what to do about money.

26

This is such a nightmare. Everything.

27

There is an issue with posting youtube videos in iframes, they have to have /embed/ in the source path. 
headache. I thought that the video just wasn't totally live or deployed on YouTube, but it might be totally not going to work.

28

 It seems like my upload limit for my YouTube channel is 8 videos for any 24 hour period. Nothing I've produced 
 is particularly interesting, but, I'll come up with something.

Total War  ROME 2 Battle of Ephesus

The Spartans are on the warpath throughout Asia Minor, no one can stop them, except for the even more amazing 
Roman Military! They will be stopped! Even if they! are! Sparta!

30

I'm spending way too much time playing computer games. I'm trying to make something out of it by recording videos 
while I play, but the videos I make aren't all that amazing.

31

There is something that I'm thinking about right now.
well. sometimes I listen to music or a documentary
while I work on other things. sometimes as an attempt at 
multi-tasking.

but right now it just seems more appropriate to work on 
this epic and fabulous poem of mine!

32

Good Lord! I spent the entire day gaming, the entire past few days actually, and I've not gotten any real work done, 
or, well, I don't really feel like I've gotten any work done.

33

I worked on my blog a little bit, made a few videos of me fixing broken links on my blog. I have to work on Project 15, 
and I really haven't even looked at what's required. There's an issue with creating an embedded iframe, it's not really
possible to link just the YouTube page into an iframe as a regular source, and suddenly I realize why, 
you only want the video, and not the whole page that's on YouTube. 

34

Walking Through The Grass (2019)

I remember walking 
to work, about a mile or so 
to a hotel where I worked, and
I had to walk through the grass
and the grass
was always wet, really wet, and 
my pants would get wet too 
and my boots would get wet 
and my socks would get wet.

36

I spent a lot of time on that project, I really enjoy the end result. I 
still want to make the contact modal work. These are comments removed from my GitHub files.

37

All the videos are now uploaded to YouTube. It took so long. i deleted my miscellaneous 
repository, but then, i created a new miscellaneous repository because I have the index to that 
repository linked elsewhere, so, I didn't want them to break, so I fixed it before it became a problem.

38

These videos that I've uploaded to YouTube today are taking forever to load. This time, I made the 
decision to upload the largest files, rather than whatever random videos occurred to me to upload. 
I figured that I could get these large files out of my storage space. but, yeah, they are taking forever to upload.

39

My software development course will be over next week. This comes as kind of a relief, but I'm also 
kind of sad about it, I really enjoyed this class. I don't know how I'm going to continue to stay 
motivated to work on web and software development projects without project being due, everything I 
work on after class will be a self directed project. Yeah, I've been spending way too much, 
mountains of time playing computer games.

40

There is kind of a chicken and egg problem going on here. I need to 
get an MMR vaccine to attend UNLV, I got my first dose something like 
5 years ago when I applied to the MBA program at UNLV, I need to get a 
second dose. I must have left Las Vegas before getting my second dose of 
the MMR vaccine. I thought I took it already when I applied at UTA, but 
the vaccine that UTA required was a meningitis vaccine. The funny thing 
about the UTA thing, the meningitis vaccine, was that they kept sending 
me notices to submit proof of vaccination for meningitis, but when I got 
around to getting the vaccine and uploading proof, it turns out I didn't 
really need to get it, it was for undergrads only. Waste of money.

41

So now I have to figure out how to get the MMR vaccine, the second dose. The 
chicken and egg problem that I'm facing is that I need my MMR vaccine to enroll 
in classes at UNLV, but I have to be enrolled in classes at UNLV to get a Student 
ID card, and use the Student Health Services and get vaccinated. This isn't a huge 
problem, it just means that I have to get vaccinated somewhere else.

42

I was experimenting with layouts for katastrophiena.com, and I really liked 
the layout that I selected, and I actually decided to apply it to 
chestnutandhazel.com. I think that it's really nice, and nothing 
really broke. I recently. I've been making all the measurements 
for the iframes percentage based, all the dimensions percentage 
based, because I figured that I might change layouts from time to 
time, and it seems to have kept things from getting messed up with 
the new layout, or, style.

43
 
I don't know what to do right now. 
I should be working on Project 16 right 
now. It's actually. I don't actually have 
to turn it in, but I should do it because 
I need the experience of doing it, and, 
well, I've just felt a whole lot less motivated lately.

44

My mind is kind of all over the place 
right now. I have a lot of things to worry 
about right now. I'm watching The Untouchables, 
Brian de Palma (1987), and this really is a good 
movie. Class starts in a few minutes. There is 
only one more day of class left, Saturday the 18th, 
but it's just a get-together kind of for the final day of class.

I have this other laptop, a second one, and it's 
extremely slow, and I use it for watching the live course 
via zoom, and I use my main laptop to do the work, but this 
thing, my other laptop, is taking forever to load, it's always 
slow, it's been slow since I bought it, and I'm really 
surprised with how slow it is. I bought it during one of the 
road trips, but, it's really super slow. so slow that it hardly functions.

45

I remember these poems from when I moved to Missouri from Las Vegas. I remember I didn't find work there for a while. In Missouri. I did get a job at the prison in town, but then, it wasn't really a job that was suitable for me, and, it wasn't a good environment for me either. I don't know what to do right now.

46

I'm using VS code right now, working on compiling the Adventures
of Chestnut + Hazel into a unified EPIC poem of the most EPIC 
proportions!

47

I am failing MIS 768. Some of this is my own doing. 
when is it not my own doing? but
one of the things
that makes this first semester different from the
web development course I took with Correlation One
is that I'm working right now. 

48

I decided to take work off during the Fall, but I've 
decided that I can't really afford to do that during the 
spring. Nightmare. 

49

I don't know. like. this might be 
the end of my educational pursuits.

I'm going to post some old poems I wrote, probably while I was at Mosaic, or during the first few months when I first came to Missouri.

50

I guess you could call it
something of a wooded area.

51

There are trees and stuff and
A little bit of other flora.

52

I really like it.

I want to put all the ashes there
and let the trees absorb the nutrients of
the ashes. Maybe someday there will be
a cure for whatever illness needs curing
in that tree.

53

After we burn the trash, we look for any metal
that we can sell to the scrap yard. Burnt Tires
leave wires of metal that can be sold to the
scarp yard. What metal is it. I don't know.

54

All the gaming videos that I've captured are either being uploaded to my 
Chestnut + Hazel channel, or my personal channel, so that's out of the way, 
but many of the files are very large, and they are taking a long time to 
upload, so I have to find something else to do in the meantime, I was supposed 
to update my browser either today or yesterday, but I forgot to do it, with all 
of this uploading I have to do, I have to keep my browser open. So I basically 
haven't closed it and re-opened it to update my browser.

55

My plans for the next few days are to finish uploading all of my gaming videos 
to my Chestnut + Hazel YouTube channel, and then hold off on gaming for a while. 
I could probably get all of that done today. I have so many videos uploaded already, 
and I think that I have about 20 more that I'm in the process of uploading. I scheduled 
them way out into the future, all the way until the end of 2024 because I didn't want them 
all dropping at once. Once that's done I'm going to focus on putting together my UNLV 
applications. I just noticed something funny, I noticed that when Slack loads, the 
screen says: Reticulating Splines, which is from SimCity.

I have 7 videos left to upload. A lot of these videos have just been sped up with 4x or 
16x to reduce the file size, and make the action happen more quickly.

56

I'm really happy about completing the Software Development course, and I'm really proud of 
this. Tomorrow is the last day of class, but it's not really a full class. I'm not sure what to do next.

57

Below I've posted an old video of a poetry reading video that I made years ago.

58

I'm not sure what to work on right now. Today is 
Sunday, and everything is kind of a free day for a 
while. I should look for work. Apply for a few positions. 
I made a few game playing videos where I have voice overs or 
narrations what what's going on, and what decisions I'm making. 
Even with the videos sped up to 10x to 16x, there still seems 
to be a lack of things to say.

59

so what am I up to right now? I'm really just making gaming videos and 
uploading them to YouTube. I tried making a YouTube short, but I think my 
video was over budget, time wise. I guess I'll find out. I could have sworn that 
I've seen YouTube shorts that are in the 4 minute range. I bought this down to 1:25 
minutes, but I'm not sure if that's short enough to be a short.

60

I'm feeling worried about the future. 
I went in for my entrance exam for the 
Spanish Translation program, and I don't 
really think that it went well: I didn't 
really study because I spent these last few 
days immersed in my gaming, and didn't do 
anything else really, and now, I'm sick of the 
game, and now I probably have time to do productive 
stuff. Part of the reason I wasn't really motivated 
to study was because I did manage to get accepted into 
the Entrepreneurship and Innovation program, and I already 
enrolled in as many classes as I plan to take, and my 
original goal was to get into one program or the other.

The thing that I'm worried about for the future is money. 
I've been out of work for 4 months, and I also 
haven't had any income, money coming in during 
that time. I tried to sign up for food delivery 
stuff, but that didn't really work. I don't really 
know what to do. I don't know what to do. I really 
don't know what to do. I would like to be working, 
but I really need to find the right role. I need to 
land the right role, the right position.

61

I'm not really looking for an employer right now.
and this comment is related to stanza 60 above,
this is akward because these are written right after
the other, but happened at very different times.
I was looking for a role last year, but not this year. 
four months later.

62

I have an exam tomorrow, and I'm not even really prepared. In 
fact I'm not even really prepared at all. I was working on this 
Spanish Translations project, but it really hasn't gone anywhere, 
and it's not even close to being done. I also have to find work; 
I thought about doing the food delivery and rideshare stuff, but, 
I had an incident today where I concluded that it might not really be 
something that is workable. There are major traffic issues in Las Vegas 
that make driving really frustrating, and I'm not really sure I would be 
able to do it. I still need to find work, though. Or some source of income.

63

there was an employer 
event at UNLV that I would have 
attended, and that I was going to attend.
but I did not attend the event. things weren't 
going well in MIS 768, so I scrapped any plans for 
that week, only for things to really go downhill 
in that class.

64

I shaved, and I think that my face looks a lot nicer than it 
does when I have facial hair, but I didn't shave my head, but 
I still think that I look a lot nicer when I have my face shaved. 
I exfoliated, and I had a lot of dead skin and all that. It was 
really kind of gross, but I was really happy to get my face clean. 
I worked on my translations project. 

The favicon stuff is annoying. sizing and stretching things. making 
it look right it the browser tab. important. but annoying.

65

I've been kind of not really doing anything lately. Nothing, other than playing on the computer, and really just playing from the start over and over, again and again. I bought a phone mount, like the kind for my car, but I mounted it on my wall next to my desk. This is kind of cool, and I've been thinking about doing this for a while, but didn't do it, because I didn't really want to spend the money on something like this, but it really helps because I usually watch movies on my phone, rather than my computer, and when my phone is just sitting on my desk I can't really see what's going on on-screen.

I have 1 more class I need to enroll in at UNLV. Just like at UTA, I have to request permission for pretty much every class I try to enroll in. I'm not sure how long I should wait before reaching out a second time. The annoying thing is, is that I didn't realize before hand that I needed to request permission for every class I need to take, so I didn't ask permission for both classes the first time, I only requested permission for the one class I thought that I needed to request permission for. I thought the other class didn't require it, so I'm waiting for the other class to be unlocked.

Spring (2023)

Translated from Primaveral (1888) by Rubén Darío

During the blossoming months, my
rhymes run in circles through a vast
forest to collect nectar and
aromatics from blooming flowers.

Come, my love! to our place: the hallowed
grove where an ambience of love floats
above the aromas of the foliage of Spring.

A bird flies from tree to tree and
greets you, and your face, blushing
and as beautiful as the dawn and the
superb oaks, tall and robust,

tremble as you walk by, its leaves
shake and its branches rise to give
way to the queen. My Love! It's the
sweet spring season.

67

There are a number of challenges I'm facing when it comes to monetizing my blogs or my other content. There are a whole bunch of Search Console issues that I'm not clear about how to fix, and then there are minimum viewer requirements on YouTube that will take a while to complete, and then there are content issues with Blogger that aren't really clear to me how to resolve.

Letters to Katastrophiena # 45

I want to get a new gaming laptop, but I have to wait until next year. One that meets the minimum requirements for the games I'm looking to play, even the new ones, doesn't look too expensive, it's more than I would normally spend on a laptop for general use, but it seems less than what gaming laptops costs, or, what I'm used to seeing gaming laptops cost. One of the things I'm not too sure about is how long the deal will last, or if gaming laptops should drop in general later on.

I'm trying to turn my gaming into something like a business, but, yeah, I don't fully know how to do that. I seem to be getting more attention my my regular YouTube channel when compared to my Chestnut + Hazel YouTube channel.

...
