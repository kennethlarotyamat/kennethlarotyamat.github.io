I don't know where else to write this. I could write it on my GitHub page, but I kind of screwed up that page while reorganizing things, so I'll just write it here.

I'm applying for a number of programs as UNLV: the MFA Creative Writing Program, the MS Quantitative Finance Program, and the MS Computer Science program.

I didn't realize this until just now: each program has a different due date, the MFA application is due first, or earliest or whatever, in January.

They are all of the Fall semester of 2024. I have to get the MFA application ready before January. I wrote one poem recently, and I really can't 
remember the last time I wrote one:

"The Young Woman who is the Post Office" (2022)

The rural carrier associate is a 
young woman with a lisp that lingers
long enough to wreck your week, and
fiery jade eyes that burn in your
mind every subsequent week.

I try to buy stamps, twenty is too much for
one stamp, and she can't break bills, and
I can't have them all, I ask to trade stamps,
one for one, she's not sure that's okay,
so she phones a friend; she asks
if I have exact change and I say:
yes! I do.

"This Is Just To Say Something About The Young Housewife" (2023)

I totally ate all of the  so many    fried turkeys
that were hanging out
by the red wheelbarrow
you know     the one glazed with
soy sauce and beside the 
                      kentucky fried 
                             kung pao chickens
           which 
themselves were drenched in
              tabasco sauce

I request neither forgiveness
nor do I intend to apologize for
          my actions 

because 

I spent several hours
of quality time
with a certain young housewife

                    who

braless and dressed in negligee 

          and 

whose wild hair suggested
she spent even more additional
even higher quality time with
both the ice man
and the fish man

       either sequentially 
               or 
              simultaneously 
                     neither would surprise me

left me    breathless    exhausted
as well as      famished

I thought I gave a good
account of myself

but then along came 
          the milkman
and    she             still
   had enough energy 
       for 
    round four

I was there
I saw it all

I'm tired. What do I have due today? I have a few class assignments and a Project due. I've been working on 
the project for days, and I've had a really hard time with it. I'll insert a few iframes below.

5

anyway, I'm kind of lost and don't really know what to do, i need to go over this course material. I don't know why this most 
recent project has monopolized my time. I got tied down with front-end 
aspects that had almost nothing to do with the assignment, and I'm irritated about it.

My new restart version of project 14 did not go as well as I thought it would have gone. I don't know what to do. I'm in a bad mood. 

There are two things that I'm thinking about doing, forking project 14 version 2 to start project 14 version 3, making one more attempt 
at the iframe carousel, and then getting the JSON and asynchronous stuff into project 14.

the other idea is going back to project 14 version 1 and just shoving the 2 additional things into it, it's a mess, but it works, 
and the cleaner version 2 doesn't work.

Irritated.

6

i'm in class right now, and all this new material is going way over my head. I'm tired, and I haven't paid attention in class in weeks. 
most of the time I'm in class trying to figure out past assignments.

7

my nails are. and I swore I just cut them, but they are long enough to be interfering with my ability to type.

8

do I have any money?

9

I'm a little bit lost right now.

10

I'm trying to think. There are a number of things I need to get done today.
I finished project 14, there were a lot of things that I wanted to do with
it, but, I ended up just going with the leaflet integration option, and
even doing that took a mountain of time. I integrated leaflet to my
Hamburgers project, and Connections for Mobile assignment.

I have a few class assignments, and I also have
some kind of professional development project that I have to
do.

and
I think that might be it.

<!-- check for deployment after a while. this was moved from codepen into vscode and uploaded to GitHub to make this function better.
I really want to update this, maybe even change the look of it. -->

I think this was about my chestnut + hazel connections page for project 14.

17

I'm uploading content to my YouTube channel, I'm not sure how exciting these videos are. 
some of these videos are very long, and take a long time to upload as well, and I can't really upload all of them at once because 
my account doesn't have those permissions just yet.

18

my nails aren't that long, but I had to cut them because they are messing with my ability to type again.

I really don't know what to do about money.

Even with as much time as I've spent on this, and seemingly no closer to getting a JSON file working, I seem to have
made a breakthrough with this carousel. The iframes look like they are interactive in a way that they were not interactive
in the original Project 10 version of the carousel.

I'm setting up links to see if the iframes in the carousel work, and if they do, then that means this should work. and I can
get project 14 completed, even though this seems like it was kind of a long digression from the requirements of project 14.

I'm spending some time today to work on my blog, as well as my YouTube channel. I don't know. I need to do something with these gaming videos, like add 
narration, or, say something, about what I'm thinking, about what some of my decisions are when I'm playing. I'm kind of thinking of going with the Vanilla 
version, rather than playing with so many mods, but, if there isn't one annoying issue with the game, there is usually some other annoying issue. One thing 
that takes up a lot more time than I would like it to, is the whole business of managing the faction and ruling dynasty.

22

This is one of my earlier videos from the channel, when I spent time reading poetry and all of that. It's interesting to see all of the voice over stuff 
that can be done with text to speech programs. I actually saw an advertisement for one that I was really impressed with.

This is such a nightmare. Everything.

There is an issue with posting youtube videos in iframes, they have to have /embed/ in the source path. 
headache. I thought that the video just wasn't totally live or deployed on YouTube, but it might be totally not going to work.

28

 It seems like my upload limit for my YouTube channel is 8 videos for any 24 hour period. Nothing I've produced 
 is particularly interesting, but, I'll come up with something.

Total War  ROME 2 Battle of Ephesus

The Spartans are on the warpath throughout Asia Minor, no one can stop them, except for the even more amazing 
Roman Military! They will be stopped! Even if they! are! Sparta!

30

I'm spending way too much time playing computer games. I'm trying to make something out of it by recording videos 
while I play, but the videos I make aren't all that amazing.

31

There is something that I'm thinking about right now.
well. sometimes I listen to music or a documentary
while I work on other things. sometimes as an attempt at 
multi-tasking.

but right now it just seems more appropriate to work on 
this epic and fabulous poem of mine!

32

Good Lord! I spent the entire day gaming, the entire past few days actually, and I've not gotten any real work done, 
or, well, I don't really feel like I've gotten any work done.

33

I worked on my blog a little bit, made a few videos of me fixing broken links on my blog. I have to work on Project 15, 
and I really haven't even looked at what's required. There's an issue with creating an embedded iframe, it's not really
possible to link just the YouTube page into an iframe as a regular source, and suddenly I realize why, 
you only want the video, and not the whole page that's on YouTube.

Walking Through The Grass (2019)

I remember walking 
to work, about a mile or so 
to a hotel where I worked, and
I had to walk through the grass
and the grass
was always wet, really wet, and 
my pants would get wet too 
and my boots would get wet 
and my socks would get wet.

36

I spent a lot of time on that project, I really enjoy the end result. I 
still want to make the contact modal work. These are comments removed from my GitHub files.
