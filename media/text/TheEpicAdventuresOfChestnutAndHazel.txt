I don't know where else to write this. I could write it on my GitHub page, but I kind of screwed up that page while reorganizing things, so I'll just write it here.

I'm applying for a number of programs as UNLV: the MFA Creative Writing Program, the MS Quantitative Finance Program, and the MS Computer Science program.

I didn't realize this until just now: each program has a different due date, the MFA application is due first, or earliest or whatever, in January.

They are all of the Fall semester of 2024. I have to get the MFA application ready before January. I wrote one poem recently, and I really can't 
remember the last time I wrote one:

"The Young Woman who is the Post Office" (2022)

The rural carrier associate is a 
young woman with a lisp that lingers
long enough to wreck your week, and
fiery jade eyes that burn in your
mind every subsequent week.

I try to buy stamps, twenty is too much for
one stamp, and she can't break bills, and
I can't have them all, I ask to trade stamps,
one for one, she's not sure that's okay,
so she phones a friend; she asks
if I have exact change and I say:
yes! I do.

"This Is Just To Say Something About The Young Housewife" (2023)

I totally ate all of the  so many    fried turkeys
that were hanging out
by the red wheelbarrow
you know     the one glazed with
soy sauce and beside the 
                      kentucky fried 
                             kung pao chickens
           which 
themselves were drenched in
              tabasco sauce

I request neither forgiveness
nor do I intend to apologize for
          my actions 

because 

I spent several hours
of quality time
with a certain young housewife

                    who

braless and dressed in negligee 

          and 

whose wild hair suggested
she spent even more additional
even higher quality time with
both the ice man
and the fish man

       either sequentially 
               or 
              simultaneously 
                     neither would surprise me

left me    breathless    exhausted
as well as      famished

I thought I gave a good
account of myself

but then along came 
          the milkman
and    she             still
   had enough energy 
       for 
    round four

I was there
I saw it all

I'm tired. What do I have due today? I have a few class assignments and a Project due. I've been working on 
the project for days, and I've had a really hard time with it. I'll insert a few iframes below.
