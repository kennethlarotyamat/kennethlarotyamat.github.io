I don't know where else to write this. 
I could write it on my GitHub page, but 
I kind of screwed up that page while reorganizing 
things, so I'll just write it here.

I'm applying for a number of programs as UNLV: the MFA 
Creative Writing Program, the MS Quantitative Finance 
Program, and the MS Computer Science program.

I didn't realize this until just now: each program has a 
different due date, the MFA application is due first, 
or earliest or whatever, in January.

They are all of the Fall semester of 2024. I have to get the 
MFA application ready before January. I wrote 
one poem recently, and I really can't 
remember the last time I wrote one:

"The Young Woman who is the Post Office" (2022)

The rural carrier associate is a 
young woman with a lisp that lingers
long enough to wreck your week, and
fiery jade eyes that burn in your
mind every subsequent week.

I try to buy stamps, twenty is too much for
one stamp, and she can't break bills, and
I can't have them all, I ask to trade stamps,
one for one, she's not sure that's okay,
so she phones a friend; she asks
if I have exact change and I say:
yes! I do.

"This Is Just To Say Something About The Young Housewife" (2023)

I totally ate all of the  so many    fried turkeys
that were hanging out
by the red wheelbarrow
you know     the one glazed with
soy sauce and beside the 
                      kentucky fried 
                             kung pao chickens
           which 
themselves were drenched in
              tabasco sauce

I request neither forgiveness
nor do I intend to apologize for
          my actions 

because 

I spent several hours
of quality time
with a certain young housewife

                    who

braless and dressed in negligee 

          and 

whose wild hair suggested
she spent even more additional
even higher quality time with
both the ice man
and the fish man

       either sequentially 
               or 
              simultaneously 
                     neither would surprise me

left me    breathless    exhausted
as well as      famished

I thought I gave a good
account of myself

but then along came 
          the milkman
and    she             still
   had enough energy 
       for 
    round four

I was there
I saw it all

I'm tired. What do I have due today? I have a few class assignments and a Project due. I've been working on 
the project for days, and I've had a really hard time with it. I'll insert a few iframes below.

5

anyway, I'm kind of lost and don't really know what to do, i need to go over this course material. I don't know why this most 
recent project has monopolized my time. I got tied down with front-end 
aspects that had almost nothing to do with the assignment, and I'm irritated about it.

My new restart version of project 14 did not go as well as I thought it would have gone. I don't know what to do. I'm in a bad mood. 

There are two things that I'm thinking about doing, forking project 14 version 2 to start project 14 version 3, making one more attempt 
at the iframe carousel, and then getting the JSON and asynchronous stuff into project 14.

the other idea is going back to project 14 version 1 and just shoving the 2 additional things into it, it's a mess, but it works, 
and the cleaner version 2 doesn't work.

Irritated.

6

i'm in class right now, and all this new material is going way over my head. I'm tired, and I haven't paid attention in class in weeks. 
most of the time I'm in class trying to figure out past assignments.

7

my nails are. and I swore I just cut them, but they are long enough to be interfering with my ability to type.

8

do I have any money?

9

I'm a little bit lost right now.

10

I'm trying to think. There are a number of things I need to get done today.
I finished project 14, there were a lot of things that I wanted to do with
it, but, I ended up just going with the leaflet integration option, and
even doing that took a mountain of time. I integrated leaflet to my
Hamburgers project, and Connections for Mobile assignment.

I have a few class assignments, and I also have
some kind of professional development project that I have to
do.

and
I think that might be it.

I think this was about my chestnut + hazel connections page for project 14.

17

I'm uploading content to my YouTube channel, I'm not sure how exciting these videos are. 
some of these videos are very long, and take a long time to upload as well, and I can't really upload all of them at once because 
my account doesn't have those permissions just yet.

18

my nails aren't that long, but I had to cut them because they are messing with my ability to type again.

I really don't know what to do about money.

Even with as much time as I've spent on this, and seemingly no closer to getting a JSON file working, I seem to have
made a breakthrough with this carousel. The iframes look like they are interactive in a way that they were not interactive
in the original Project 10 version of the carousel.

I'm setting up links to see if the iframes in the carousel work, and if they do, then that means this should work. and I can
get project 14 completed, even though this seems like it was kind of a long digression from the requirements of project 14.

-->

21

I'm spending some time today to work on my blog, as well as my YouTube channel. 
I don't know. I need to do something with these gaming videos, like add 
narration, or, say something, about what I'm thinking, about what some of my 
decisions are when I'm playing. I'm kind of thinking of going with the Vanilla 
version, rather than playing with so many mods, but, if there isn't one annoying 
issue with the game, there is usually some other annoying issue. One thing 
that takes up a lot more time than I would like it to, is the whole business of 
managing the faction and ruling dynasty.

22

This is one of my earlier videos from the channel, when I 
spent time reading poetry and all of that. It's 
interesting to see all of the voice over stuff 
that can be done with text to speech programs. I actually 
saw an advertisement for one that I was really impressed with.

"Here's to momma dollar, and poppa dollar!"

I don't know what to do about money.

26

This is such a nightmare. Everything.

27

There is an issue with posting youtube 
videos in iframes, they have to 
have /embed/ in the source path. 
headache. I thought that the video just wasn't 
totally live or deployed on YouTube, but it 
might be totally not going to work.

28

 It seems like my upload limit for my YouTube channel is 8 videos 
 for any 24 hour period. Nothing I've produced 
 is particularly interesting, but, I'll come up with something.

29

Total War  ROME 2 Battle of Ephesus

The Spartans are on the warpath throughout Asia 
Minor, no one can stop them, except for the even more amazing 
Roman Military! They will be stopped! Even if they! are! Sparta!

30

I'm spending way too much time playing 
computer games. I'm trying to make something 
out of it by recording videos 
while I play, but the videos I make aren't 
all that amazing.

31

There is something that I'm thinking about right now.
well. sometimes I listen to music or a documentary
while I work on other things. sometimes as an attempt at 
multi-tasking.

but right now it just seems more appropriate to work on 
this epic and fabulous poem of mine!

32

Good Lord! I spent the entire day gaming, the 
entire past few days actually, and I've not 
gotten any real work done, 
or, well, I don't really feel like I've gotten 
any work done.

33

I worked on my blog a little bit, made a few videos of me 
fixing broken links on my blog. I have to work on Project 15, 
and I really haven't even looked at what's required. 
There's an issue with creating an embedded iframe, it's not really
possible to link just the YouTube page into an iframe as a 
regular source, and suddenly I realize why, 
you only want the video, and not the whole page that's on YouTube. 

34

Walking Through The Grass (2019)

I remember walking 
to work, about a mile or so 
to a hotel where I worked, and
I had to walk through the grass
and the grass
was always wet, really wet, and 
my pants would get wet too 
and my boots would get wet 
and my socks would get wet.

36

I spent a lot of time on that project, I really enjoy the end result. I 
still want to make the contact modal work. These are comments removed from my GitHub files.

37

All the videos are now uploaded to YouTube. It took so long. i deleted my miscellaneous 
repository, but then, i created a new miscellaneous repository because I have the index to that 
repository linked elsewhere, so, I didn't want them to break, so I fixed it before it became a problem.

38

These videos that I've uploaded to YouTube today are taking forever to load. This time, I made the 
decision to upload the largest files, rather than whatever random videos occurred to me to upload. 
I figured that I could get these large files out of my 
storage space. but, yeah, they are taking forever to upload.

39

My software development course will be over next week. This comes as kind of a relief, but I'm also 
kind of sad about it, I really enjoyed this class. I don't know how I'm going to continue to stay 
motivated to work on web and software development projects without project being due, everything I 
work on after class will be a self directed project. Yeah, I've been spending way too much, 
mountains of time playing computer games.

40

There is kind of a chicken and egg problem going on here. I need to 
get an MMR vaccine to attend UNLV, I got my first dose something like 
5 years ago when I applied to the MBA program at UNLV, I need to get a 
second dose. I must have left Las Vegas before getting my second dose of 
the MMR vaccine. I thought I took it already when I applied at UTA, but 
the vaccine that UTA required was a meningitis vaccine. The funny thing 
about the UTA thing, the meningitis vaccine, was that they kept sending 
me notices to submit proof of vaccination for meningitis, but when I got 
around to getting the vaccine and uploading proof, it turns out I didn't 
really need to get it, it was for undergrads only. Waste of money.

41

So now I have to figure out how to get the MMR vaccine, the second dose. The 
chicken and egg problem that I'm facing is that I need my MMR vaccine to enroll 
in classes at UNLV, but I have to be enrolled in classes at UNLV to get a Student 
ID card, and use the Student Health Services and get vaccinated. This isn't a huge 
problem, it just means that I have to get vaccinated somewhere else.

42

I was experimenting with layouts for katastrophiena.com, and I really liked 
the layout that I selected, and I actually decided to apply it to 
chestnutandhazel.com. I think that it's really nice, and nothing 
really broke. I recently. I've been making all the measurements 
for the iframes percentage based, all the dimensions percentage 
based, because I figured that I might change layouts from time to 
time, and it seems to have kept things from getting messed up with 
the new layout, or, style.

43
 
I don't know what to do right now. 
I should be working on Project 16 right 
now. It's actually. I don't actually have 
to turn it in, but I should do it because 
I need the experience of doing it, and, 
well, I've just felt a whole lot less motivated lately.

44

My mind is kind of all over the place 
right now. I have a lot of things to worry 
about right now. I'm watching The Untouchables, 
Brian de Palma (1987), and this really is a good 
movie. Class starts in a few minutes. There is 
only one more day of class left, Saturday the 18th, 
but it's just a get-together kind of for the final day of class.

I have this other laptop, a second one, and it's 
extremely slow, and I use it for watching the live course 
via zoom, and I use my main laptop to do the work, but this 
thing, my other laptop, is taking forever to load, it's always 
slow, it's been slow since I bought it, and I'm really 
surprised with how slow it is. I bought it during one of the 
road trips, but, it's really super 
slow. so slow that it hardly functions.

45

I remember these poems from when I moved to Missouri from Las 
Vegas. I remember I didn't find work there for a 
while. In Missouri. I did get a job at the prison in town, 
but then, it wasn't really a job that was suitable 
for me, and, it wasn't a good environment 
for me either. I don't know what to do right now.

46

I'm using VS code right now, working on compiling the Adventures
of Chestnut + Hazel into a unified EPIC poem of the most EPIC 
proportions!

47

I am failing MIS 768. Some of this is my own doing. 
when is it not my own doing? but
one of the things
that makes this first semester different from the
web development course I took with Correlation One
is that I'm working right now. 

48

I decided to take work off during the Fall, but I've 
decided that I can't really afford to do that during the 
spring. Nightmare. 

49

I don't know. like. this might be 
the end of my educational pursuits.

I'm going to post some old poems I wrote, 
probably while I was at Mosaic, or during 
the first few months when I first came to Missouri.

50

I guess you could call it
something of a wooded area.

51

There are trees and stuff and
A little bit of other flora.

52

I really like it.

I want to put all the ashes there
and let the trees absorb the nutrients of
the ashes. Maybe someday there will be
a cure for whatever illness needs curing
in that tree.

53

After we burn the trash, we look for any metal
that we can sell to the scrap yard. Burnt Tires
leave wires of metal that can be sold to the
scarp yard. What metal is it. I don't know.

54

All the gaming videos that I've captured are either being uploaded to my 
Chestnut + Hazel channel, or my personal channel, so that's out of the way, 
but many of the files are very large, and they are taking a long time to 
upload, so I have to find something else to do in the meantime, I was supposed 
to update my browser either today or yesterday, but I forgot to do it, with all 
of this uploading I have to do, I have to keep my browser open. So I basically 
haven't closed it and re-opened it to update my browser.

55

My plans for the next few days are to finish uploading all of my gaming videos 
to my Chestnut + Hazel YouTube channel, and then hold off on gaming for a while. 
I could probably get all of that done today. I have so many videos uploaded already, 
and I think that I have about 20 more that I'm in the process of uploading. I scheduled 
them way out into the future, all the way until the end of 2024 because I didn't want them 
all dropping at once. Once that's done I'm going to focus on putting together my UNLV 
applications. I just noticed something funny, I noticed that when Slack loads, the 
screen says: Reticulating Splines, which is from SimCity.

I have 7 videos left to upload. A lot of these videos have just been sped up with 4x or 
16x to reduce the file size, and make the action happen more quickly.

56

I'm really happy about completing the Software 
Development course, and I'm really proud of 
this. Tomorrow is the last day of class, but it's 
not really a full class. I'm not sure what to do next.

57

Below I've posted an old video of a poetry reading video that I made years ago.

58

I'm not sure what to work on right now. Today is 
Sunday, and everything is kind of a free day for a 
while. I should look for work. Apply for a few positions. 
I made a few game playing videos where I have voice overs or 
narrations what what's going on, and what decisions I'm making. 
Even with the videos sped up to 10x to 16x, there still seems 
to be a lack of things to say.

59

so what am I up to right now? I'm really just making gaming videos and 
uploading them to YouTube. I tried making a YouTube short, but I think my 
video was over budget, time wise. I guess I'll find out. I could have sworn that 
I've seen YouTube shorts that are in the 4 minute range. I bought this down to 1:25 
minutes, but I'm not sure if that's short enough to be a short.

60

I'm feeling worried about the future. 
I went in for my entrance exam for the 
Spanish Translation program, and I don't 
really think that it went well: I didn't 
really study because I spent these last few 
days immersed in my gaming, and didn't do 
anything else really, and now, I'm sick of the 
game, and now I probably have time to do productive 
stuff. Part of the reason I wasn't really motivated 
to study was because I did manage to get accepted into 
the Entrepreneurship and Innovation program, and I already 
enrolled in as many classes as I plan to take, and my 
original goal was to get into one program or the other.

The thing that I'm worried about for the future is money. 
I've been out of work for 4 months, and I also 
haven't had any income, money coming in during 
that time. I tried to sign up for food delivery 
stuff, but that didn't really work. I don't really 
know what to do. I don't know what to do. I really 
don't know what to do. I would like to be working, 
but I really need to find the right role. I need to 
land the right role, the right position.

61

I'm not really looking for an employer right now.
and this comment is related to stanza 60 above,
this is akward because these are written right after
the other, but happened at very different times.
I was looking for a role last year, but not this year. 
four months later.

62

I have an exam tomorrow, and I'm not even really prepared. In 
fact I'm not even really prepared at all. I was working on this 
Spanish Translations project, but it really hasn't gone anywhere, 
and it's not even close to being done. I also have to find work; 
I thought about doing the food delivery and rideshare stuff, but, 
I had an incident today where I concluded that it might not really be 
something that is workable. There are major traffic issues in Las Vegas 
that make driving really frustrating, and I'm not really sure I would be 
able to do it. I still need to find work, though. Or some source of income.

63

there was an employer 
event at UNLV that I would have 
attended, and that I was going to attend.
but I did not attend the event. things weren't 
going well in MIS 768, so I scrapped any plans for 
that week, only for things to really go downhill 
in that class.

64

I shaved, and I think that my face looks a lot nicer than it 
does when I have facial hair, but I didn't shave my head, but 
I still think that I look a lot nicer when I have my face shaved. 
I exfoliated, and I had a lot of dead skin and all that. It was 
really kind of gross, but I was really happy to get my face clean. 
I worked on my translations project. 

The favicon stuff is annoying. sizing and stretching things. making 
it look right it the browser tab. important. but annoying.

65

I've been kind of not really doing anything lately. Nothing, other than playing on the computer, 
and really just playing from the start over and over, again and again. I bought a phone mount, 
like the kind for my car, but I mounted it on my wall next to my desk. This is kind of cool, and 
I've been thinking about doing this for a while, but didn't do it, because I didn't really want to 
spend the money on something like this, but it really helps because I usually watch movies on my 
phone, rather than my computer, and when my phone is just sitting on my desk I can't really see 
what's going on on-screen.

I have 1 more class I need to enroll in at UNLV. Just like at UTA, I have to request permission 
for pretty much every class I try to enroll in. I'm not sure how long I should wait before 
reaching out a second time. The annoying thing is, is that I didn't realize before hand that 
I needed to request permission for every class I need to take, so I didn't ask permission for 
both classes the first time, I only requested permission for the one class I thought that I 
needed to request permission for. I thought the other class didn't require it, so I'm waiting 
for the other class to be unlocked.

Spring (2023)

Translated from Primaveral (1888) by Rubén Darío

During the blossoming months, my
rhymes run in circles through a vast
forest to collect nectar and
aromatics from blooming flowers.

Come, my love! to our place: the hallowed
grove where an ambience of love floats
above the aromas of the foliage of Spring.

A bird flies from tree to tree and
greets you, and your face, blushing
and as beautiful as the dawn and the
superb oaks, tall and robust,

tremble as you walk by, its leaves
shake and its branches rise to give
way to the queen. My Love! It's the
sweet spring season.

67

There are a number of challenges I'm facing when it comes to monetizing my blogs 
or my other content. There are a whole bunch of Search Console issues that I'm not 
clear about how to fix, and then there are minimum viewer requirements on YouTube 
that will take a while to complete, and then there are content issues with Blogger 
that aren't really clear to me how to resolve.

68

I want to get a new gaming laptop, but I have to wait until next year. One that 
meets the minimum requirements for the games I'm looking to play, even the new 
ones, doesn't look too expensive, it's more than I would normally spend on a 
laptop for general use, but it seems less than what gaming laptops costs, or, 
what I'm used to seeing gaming laptops cost. One of the things I'm not too sure 
about is how long the deal will last, or if 
gaming laptops should drop in general later on.

I'm trying to turn my gaming into something like a business, but, yeah, I don't 
fully know how to do that. I seem to be getting more attention my my regular 
YouTube channel when compared to my Chestnut + Hazel YouTube channel.

69

These posts. and this is just a note. these stanzas, although 
they are numbered sequentially, the events they refer to are not 
in. they are not necessarily in chronological order.  

they might not even be in the order 
they were originally published in. and not in the order 
they were originally written in. so. good luck to anyone

There
are no words to 
describe
the agony of
eating too much
food at the buffet
when you go to
the buffet 
and eat all 
that you can eat.

There was a place that i came across 
today while I was out DoorDashing, 
and it was a place called ONO or 
something. Ono Sushi. I just looked 
it up. I think that I might want to eat there.

71

I did food delivery work today. I delivered 1 meal. It didn't take long to 
get the first order, but after that order, the zone I was working in dried 
up, so I switched zones, once I got there, there weren't really any orders 
to pick up, so I figured there wasn't really much work that day, so I went 
home. I've very rarely been able to make delivering food profitable.

72

If she asks me 
why I wasn't able to 
get anything done while 
she was away, I will tell her 
the truth: I was thinking about 
you, and when I think about you, 
when I started thinking about you 
I couldn't stop masterbating.
so I fell asleep. afterward.

I deleted my facebook, instagram, twitter (X), and 
linkedin accounts. I also think that deleted a 
number of other social media accounts as well, 
Pinterest. I'm not sure I really used that account.

One of the things that sometimes worried me about using. 
one of the things that often worried me about deleting 
these accounts is that. Maybe. someone might create a 
fake account using my name and all that. I don't know. 
I won't worry about that right now. I'm honestly. really. 
I'm surprised how many other Ken Yamat, and kenneth Yamat 
profiles are out there. I guess my name isn't all that 
special after all.

78

Door Dashing really can be a challenge. 
and. it's not always just a simple game of 
picking up and dropping off food.

i. honestly. really wish it was that easy.

79

Um. So I did Door Dash today, I had one order. 
for like 3 hours of driving, and I'm somewhat 
discouraged. After spending all that money to obtain 
business licenses, and getting a commercial auto policy 
that's way more expensive than what I was paying for a 
personal policy. I'm, you know. Not sure what to do.

The order that I did get was somewhat accidental, I was 
toggling between per order and per hours just to check 
it out, and the order I got was a per hour order.

and I'm thinking, it might make sense to switch between 
the two during certain times of the day. The traffic was 
really bad in whatever area I was in.

Anyway. I called it a day after trying for 3 hours, and only 
getting one order. Some days are better than others, and I think. 
on days where it seems like slim pickings, it might make sense 
to just go back home and work on something else.

80

Today. and I'm referring to the 18th, I often stay up 
overnight. Today wasn't a very fruitful day in terms of 
Door Dashing. The weekend wasn't as much of a money maker 
as I thought it would have been.

My conclusion is that it might be better to start later on 
in the day. Maybe around 8:00 PM or something. I've been 
pushing my start times back further and further. I 
thought 4:00 PM was already somewhat late.

If I'm going to work nights, then I need to buy a jacket.

82

DoorDashing. yeah. I'm really not looking 
for an employer right now. being self-employed 
is a challenge, but. I'm just really not looking 
for an employer right now.

83

I managed to buy a jacket today.

84

Money hasn't been this tight in a while, but there is 
one positive thing. I think that I'm able to stop pulling 
money out of my savings, and eventually, to start paying 
down my credit balances.

85

Life is extremely challenging right now.

86

I went on a road trip. not a very exciting one, but, 
I don't know. I'm in a slightly better mood than before. 
I went from Las Vegas, to San Diego, to Yuma, and back to Vegas.

87

Really not looking for an employer right now. I'm really not.

I went on a road trip. not a very exciting one, but, I don't

Las Vegas, to San Diego, to Yuma, and back to Vegas.

88

My focus right now is to work on my 
catalog of intellectual property.
my focus is not to find an employer.

89

If I were still filing a continued unemployment claim 
I probably would be looking for an employer, but since I'm 
not filing a claim, I'm not looking!

I went on a road trip. not a very exciting one, 
but, I don't know. I'm in a slightly better mood

91

as far as MIS 768 goes. I'm just not really sure 
what to do right now. and what I mean is:
I know that I'm failing the course. I know that I 
will have to audit the course. what I'm trying 
to figure out is how to salvage this situation? 
how do I, you know, still get something for the 
money I paid to take the course?

92

A few days ago I took a road trip from 
Las Vegas, to San Diego, to Yuma, and back 
to Las Vegas. San Diego reminds me of Austin, 
just older and larger.

93

There is a convention from MIS 768 that I like, and it's this:

/*		
Author's Name: 		    	Kenneth Larot Yamat

Purpose of Program:			To calculate the shipping 
                            cost of a parcel at a 
                            parcel service store
                        
Date Due:					March 3rd, 2024
*/

94

I don't know how I would use that in this document.
this is going to be registered as a Poem, like an Epic Poem 
of ancient antiquity!

95

Life is something of a 
nightmare right now.

I thought the bleeding would 
stop, that I'd get my 
budget in order during December, 
but that is something that did not happen.

I don't even want to make any remarks 
about what I anticipate for January, 
out of a fear that I might jinx it.

96

// /**/System.out.println(" Data for Package # 1"); // entryNumber// this number

School starts soon. Later on 
in the month. There are a few 
things I need to get done to prepare, 
but I've been so busy doing DoorDash 
that I haven't exactly come around to 
it, but I have to get it done today.

99

I'm in a really lousy mood right now. 
I'm kind of stressed out. I'm kind of 
frustrated about things right now.

I managed to finish quite a bit of the 
required tasks for school. Mostly 
orientation related tasks and online 
modules.

I need to go out Door Dashing and all that, 
but I'm really tired right now, but it's 
kind of a mood related fatigue.

100

When something is published. When something 
is pushed to GitHub. I really do considered 
published. because. it's avaiable to the 
public. it's just that not many people 
are on, you know digging around in repositories
reading text files and all that.

but I do consider this published.

102

Back in November I bought a vape pen a refillable one 
after trying the disposable vape pens for a while and this 
thing will not stop leaking I don't know what to do I'm 
thinking about getting a different type of vape pen I'm 
not sure I really like the disposable vape pens but it's 
primarily based on cost because the disposables are 
just so expensive

School has started and yesterday was our first day of orientation 
this semester I'm taking two classes both of them are MIS classes

I'm enrolled in the entrepreneurship program I'm not sure 
what kind of business I would start if I were to start one 
the other day I was trying to buy clothes and I just have 
so many problems with getting the correct fit and if I were 
to start something it would be like some kind of clothes 
business I thought about buying a sewing machine because 
like my pants are just too damn long but I don't know if 
I really want to start sewing stuff because it's such a 
headache I have all these pants that just don't fit and 
it never really mattered because I always wore boots so 
like if if my pants were too long it wasn't really a 
problem and I really didn't notice.

I'm using text to speech to write this. I don't really 
get much time to sit down and type so finding this feature 
on my phone has turned out to be really useful. nothing is 
punctuated and I guess that's just the way text to speech 
works, but I could always go back and punctuate this if I need to.

There are a few things that I realized while I was door 
dashing that made me start to use text to speech one of 
the things was that I can't really type if I'm driving 
but if I use the phone if somebody wants to access what 
I have to say they have to access their voicemail box 
like if I leave a message and so it just made more sense 
to use text to speech and send it by text the way they 
could just read whatever I said it's not like I'm really 
saying anything to complex when I'm using text to speech 
for the most part anyway

A while ago I think I wrote about how I wanted to buy 
a jacket and what ended up happening is that I ended 
up buying two sweaters two jackets and four pairs of 
pants after buying the sweaters I realized that I don't 
really like sweaters and part of the reason for that is 
that with jackets I have a jacket pocket and I don't really 
like having so many things in my pants pockets so I bought 
these sweaters and I'm not really planning on using them

I really like the sweaters but from a usefulness 
standpoint I just don't anticipate 
ever really wearing them

103

classes start on the 16th. the two orientation 
classes are over. I wore a tie for the second day, 
but, it was mostly for getting a portrait photograph 
taken, but, I seem to have missed it. I guess I thought 
that there would be a kind of designated time to get our 
portrait photos taken, but, it was more of whenever you 
have the opportunity to get one kind of deal. and. yeah, i missed it.

105

I bought a new toilet seat. The wood ones were 
less expensive than the plastic ones, which was nice, 
so, I bought a wood one.

106

I'm trying to think.

107

I bought a parking pass. I think that I only 
have class once a week, and it's after parking 
enforcement hours. so maybe I didn't really need to 
pay for a parking permit, but then again, I might be on 
campus to do this or that, and, I'm going to apply for 
positions on campus, so I might use it.

I need to get a new phone, my current phone is cracked, 
and, it's also kind of falling apart.

109

I finally bought a new phone. My last one 
cracked not too long after I bought it. It 
was weird because I hadn't cracked a phone 
that soon after buying it in a while. I think 
I had it for 7 months. My last phone was really 
falling apart, it wasn't just cracked.

110

I'm really frustrated right 
now. I really feel like 
going on a short road trip 
to blow off some steam, but 
I kind of scheduled an appointment 
for Monday, but there was no 
confirmation on the other side, so.

and

today is 
already monday.

so. a road trip is 
kind of out of the 
question right now.

and

i have to be prudent 
about how i waste my time.

maybe i could go out and

eat something ridiculous, but
i don't know of anything ridiculous
that's open at 3 AM.

the only kind of food that's available
at 3 AM is basically totally normal
kinds of food.

Let's see:

Hitchin' Post Saloon

I've actually been wanting to eat 
here for a while, but, I think this 
is some kind of steakhouse or something, 
and that's pretty much normal food.

Bourbon Street Sports Bar

I've eaten here before, and I think I spent like 30 bucks. 
I don't mind spending 30 bucks on a meal, but the meal 
has to be worth 30 bucks, and whatever I ate here really 
wasn't worth 30 bucks.

Northstar Bar and Grill

this place is close, but I think it's just 
normal food.

there are a number of taco stands and taco trucks, 
the last time I went to a taco stand I spent 47 
dollars. i think I ate 18 tacos, it was some 
multiple of 6. I think it was 14 tacos actually.

I want to eat some kind of
fish.

I'm still in a really lousy mood right now.

i'm trying to think.

I want to eat indian food.

Delhi Indian & Nepali Cuisine Express

the building that's on google maps 
isn't really all that sexy.
but the address

333 W St Louis Ave, Las Vegas, NV 89102

I basically have to eat there now.
and here's why

333 is simply one of my favorite numbers.

and west saint louis just kills me because

kansas city is in the west and saint louis is on the 
eastern part of missouri. kansas city is part kansas and 
part missouri, and saint louis is part missouri and part illinois.

place isn't open right now though.

oh. I realize what this is.

it's a
Virtual restaurant

it's basically doordash only kind of orders. 
like it basically only exists to fulfill doordash orders.

I'm still trying to think.

at this point i'm not even hungry anymore.

i'm in slightly less of a bad mood.

111

good god.

i need to get something to eat

i'm not hungry really

i'm just not really in much of a good mood.

i'm in a really garbage kind of mood.

i'm not even hungry.
and
eating something is not really
a solution

but i can't really think of anything else 
i enjoy doing

i don't feel hungry

112

so i ended up at saffron flavors of india

113

this is one of the few times i've ever 
successfully fixed a Google Search Console 
issue. but this also comes with . this also 
came with a seperate email stating that i 
had not resolved some other - seperate 
google search console issue.

114

i have to watch what i eat when i go out. i really
feel like i ate too much.
i have to get these small assignments done.
I don't know what to do for money. I haven't interviewed for anything in a while.

[Development Commentary]

<!-- [11/04/2023 23:10] Create a link for Chestnut and Hazel Connection, Mobile Version -->

Sometimes when I go into interviews it's not clear to me if the interviewer 
is just looking to kill time, or if they are actually looking to fill the 
role. When I went into this interview with Copart, it felt like the interviewer 
only had the intention of mocking my work history, and like, she didn't start the 
interview until an hour or so after the scheduled time.

I'm still really angry that my unemployment claim was denied, 
and that I'm not getting paid out on it.

but.

if they aren't going to pay me, then I almost see no reason to look for work.
I'll keep looking as long as I have an appeal outstanding, but, in many ways it
feels like looking for work is a total waste of my time.

I'm worried about running out of money before I get into college. 
I can't seem to put together
enough letters of recommendation, and, this is a real nightmare. A real nightmare.

I can't really leave Las Vegas, and UNLV is the only college in Las Vegas 
that has a graduate school.
All the programs at UNLV require more letters of recommendation that I can 
reasonably put together,
and. I don't know.

Total War ROME 2: Battle of Pella (2023) During the Macedonian wars of 209 BC The 
Julian Dynasty takes the bold move to attack the Macedonians at the very heart of 
their empire: The Capital of Pella. Defended by their own world renowned Macedonian 
warriors, and reinforced by their Epirot and Spartan allies, the Capital of Pella 
makes for a difficult battle, over the course of three separate major assaults on 
the city, Pella is finally captured by none other than Sextus Nerva himself.

I had to get 
rid of a bunch 
of this stuff for 
some reason.

115

I don't why my life always goes 
straight to hell every now and then.

116

what a nightmare. a total nightmare. 
I don't know what else to say. things 
are not going the way that I want them 
to. headache. nightmare. life oscillates 
between being a headache, to a nightmare, 
and back.

117

I'm not sure what to work on right now. 
Today is Sunday, and everything is kind of a 
free day for a while. I should look for work. 
Apply for a few positions. I made a few game 
playing videos where I have voice overs or 
narrations what what's going on, and what 
decisions I'm making. Even with the videos 
sped up to 10x to 16x, there still seems to 
be a lack of things to say.

119

so what am I up to right now? I'm really 
just making gaming videos and uploading them 
to YouTube. I tried making a YouTube short, 
but I think my video was over budget, time wise. 
I guess I'll find out. I could have sworn that 
I've seen YouTube shorts that are in the 4 minute 
range. I bought this down to 1:25 minutes, but I'm 
not sure if that's short enough to be a short.

120

I am failing MIS 768 right now. really 
hard too. I applied for the computer Science 
program, and. if i'm failing an MIS course. then.
well.

121

I've added some content below from my Spanish Translations 
project. I've recently got bogged down messing around with 
an old project that doesn't seem to work in it's new area. 
I don't know what's going on, or why it doesn't work except 
on my landing page. I did get rid of something that was 
making it kind of a headache, and the thing was the 
transform hover effect.

122

I'm going to forget about messing around with fixing the
project 11 contact form, for whatever reason, it does not
work. It's the same thing as what i have on my landing page,
so I don't know why it doesn't work. so dumb. I might try one
more thing. but then again, I really have to work on my
translations project, and this is just something I'm messing
around with.

123

I'm putting together the texts that I'll be translating for
this project. I'm also working on my YouTube videos. For video
editing, I'm mostly just consolidating and speeding up videos
and adding music, and uploading them, and I can't really do this
while playing the games themselves because my computer slows down
a lot.

Buying a new gaming laptop is something that I thought about, but
I think that I'll wait to do it. A gaming computer that can play
the games I want to play doesn't look too expensive, but I really
have to wait to spend that kind of money right now.


Two Spanish Language Authors have been replaced

César Vallejo with José de Espronceda
&
Pablo Neruda with Antonio Machado

I created a few additional JavaScript functions to allow
the contact forms to be visible inside the iframe and clickable
inside the list.

124

I think that everything has been set up, once everything is
deployed, then I can focus on making translations for the
pages that I've set up.

125

So I set up the .md files for the four authors that I'm going
to translate from English to Spanish, and the four authors
that I'm going to translate from Spanish to English. I selected
all authors whose work I expect to be in the Public Domain.

126

VS Code is such a great too. even 
for editing non-computer code 
documents.

127

Getting the Readme iframe and Document Title swap to work is complete,
the next stage in this project is to pick 4 authors to translate.

I'll pick four authors to translate from English to Spanish,
and 4 authors to translate from Spanish to English.

For English to Spanish:

William Carlos Williams
T. S. Eliot
Wallace Stevens
E. E. Cummings

For Spanish to English:

Rubén Darío
César Vallejo
Pablo Neruda
Miguel de Unamuno

128

This is awesome! it actually works, the title and the document
change when clicked! I'm going to come back around to this and
continue to work on it later.

129

There are a few other things that I need to work on, 
I need to set up katastrophiena to be eligible for 
AdSense, and, I think that the main thing is that 
I need a longer history of posts for this blog. This 
might take a while, and take away from all the other 
things that I'm working on. Anyway. I'm getting sucked 
into computer gaming right now, not with any games that 
are new, but games that I've had for a long time. I've 
been thinking about buying a gaming laptop, something 
inexpensive, and I came across one, but, I really 
have to hold out on buying anything like that right now.

I have to wait before spending money on something 
like a new laptop, at least until next year.

130

I'm working on a number of things right now. 
One is setting up a page on GitHub Pages for 
my Spanish Translations Project. I was having 
trouble with a contact forms section of my page, 
this isn't needed for my Translations Page, I just 
set it up so it works, or, I'm just been trying to 
make the links work. Basically, I took Project 16, 
my Project 16 page, and used it as a starting point 
for my Spanish Translations Project. One of the things 
I left from the old page and kept on the new page was 
a section for Contact Forms that I made throughout the 
course I took. There is one Contact Form that just doesn't 
really work. It's the one from Project 11 I don't know 
what wrong.

and I'm really not in the mood to work on it because. 
I just really don't really want to work on it right 
now. So I guess I wont.

131

There is one thing that I have found that helps 
with the video uploading process, for longer videos, 
it makes sense to speed up the video all the way up to 
16x speed, and the reason why is that, videos longer 
than an hour, and even longer than 10 minutes, are 
really slow paced, and it's much easier to get an 
idea of what's happening when the video is moving 
faster. This also reduces the file size, and makes 
uploading quicker.

There are some games that are really slow paced, 
like the tower game that I'm playing, but also, 
the same is true for many other city building games as well.

132

I need to come up with a better workflow for uploading 
gaming videos to YouTube. They take a hell of a long 
time to upload, especially larger files, I would reduce 
the file size, but it's not really clear to me how to do 
that. There is an issue with gaming videos, they often 
need to be high resolution, a lot of these videos need to 
be high resolution, I don't even have a very large screen 
on my laptop, and in many cases, the videos seem to be 
blurry. On the other hand, I'm not sure if these are 
going to be viewed mainly on a large screen, or a small 
screen, like a phone.

133

I'm thinking about how everything seems to have been falling 
apart for me over these past few months. I lost my job, I 
haven't found a new one, and I'm burning through my money. 
I'm a little bit demotivated. or unmotivated. or just basically 
lacking very much or even any motivation. I'm cutting it close 
it terms of money. I need to find work. Land a job or something.
 
The Internet connection here is slow, it's not normally this 
slow, but for whatever reason, it's slower than syrup. I'm 
working on a number of things right now, but I'm also kind 
of bouncing around mentally from idea to idea, from worry to 
worry.

Somewhere in the back of my mind I'm wondering if I'm cursed 
or something. Like, there's nothing I can do, and this is just 
the way things are going to go for me, but I have no idea why 
I would be cursed, or what would be the cause of the curse, or 
why I would be cursed, or who would want to place a curse on me.

134

I've added some content below from my Spanish Translations project. 
I've recently got bogged down messing around with an old project that

137

I haven't even looked at the Spanish Translation 
project in a while. After not passing the Spanish Entrance 
exam I more or less figured I would put it on the back burner.

I have to wait before spending money on something like a new 
laptop, at least until next year.

I'm working on a number of things right now. One is setting up 
a page on GitHub Pages for my Spanish Translations Project. I 
was having trouble with a contact forms section of my page, 
this isn't needed for my Translations Page, I just set it up 
so it works, or, I'm just been trying to make the links work. 
Basically, I took Project 16, my Project 16 page, and used it 
as a starting point for my Spanish Translations Project. One 
of the things I left from the old page and kept on the new page 
was a section for Contact Forms that I made throughout the course 
I took. There is one Contact Form that just doesn't really work. 
It's the one from Project 11 I don't know what wrong.

and I'm really not in the mood to work on it because. I just really 
don't really want to work on it right now. So I guess I wont.

143

There is one thing that I have found that helps with the video uploading 
process, for longer videos, it makes sense to speed up the video all the 
way up to 16x speed, and the reason why is that, videos longer than an 
hour, and even longer than 10 minutes, are really slow paced, and it's 
much easier to get an idea of what's happening when the video is moving 
faster. This also reduces the file size, and makes uploading quicker.

There are some games that are really slow paced, like the tower game 
that I'm playing, but also, the same is true for many other city 
building games as well.

144

I need to come up with a better workflow for uploading gaming videos 
to YouTube. They take a hell of a long time to upload, especially 
larger files, I would reduce the file size, but it's not really clear 
to me how to do that. There is an issue with gaming videos, they often 
need to be high resolution, a lot of these videos need to be high 
resolution, I don't even have a very large screen on my laptop, 
and in many cases, the videos seem to be blurry. On the other hand, 
I'm not sure if these are going to be viewed mainly on a large 
screen, or a small screen, like a phone.

145

I'm thinking about how everything seems to have been falling apart 
for me over these past few months. I lost my job, I haven't found 
a new one, and I'm burning through my money. I'm a little bit 
demotivated. or unmotivated. or just basically lacking very much 
or even any motivation. I'm cutting it close it terms of money. 
I need to find work. Land a job or something.
 
The Internet connection here is slow, it's not normally this slow, 
but for whatever reason, it's slower than syrup. I'm working on a 
number of things right now, but I'm also kind of bouncing around 
mentally from idea to idea, from worry to worry.

Somewhere in the back of my mind I'm wondering if I'm cursed or something. 
Like, there's nothing I can do, and this is just the way things are going 
to go for me, but I have no idea why I would be cursed, or what would be the 
cause of the curse, or why I would be cursed, or who would want to place a 
curse on me.

One of the issues I have with what I post on chestnutandhazel.com is that It's hosted, or whatever, it's really just an account
on blogger.com, so since it's basically a social media account, I have to comply with the community guidles of blogger.com, and
since I have adsense active on that page, I also have to comply with any adsense advertiser standards, so I have my hands tied 
in many respects. chestnutandhazel.com continues to get flagged over and over and over, and in many cases I don't really want to 
deal with it right away.

the other issue is that I also have to post what I write somewhere, so that I can use the standard copyright registration form,
rather than the unpublished copyright registration form, so, that's another issue. so you know, it's kind of whatever.

I'm feeling incredibly scatter brained. I have a project 
due for my software and web development course today, and 
I haven't even started. This should be simple, so I'm not 
too worried about it, but, at the same time, I know from 
the past that these things could take quite a while if I 
hit a brick wall.

There are other issues that I'm facing, especially on the 
income front. The temp assignment was not a particularly 
good fit, and, I really get the feeling that I should avoid 
any kind of warehouse or factory work, even though, that's 
sort of what I've been doing for the past five years, but I 
don't have the slightest clue what to look for.

Life is such an unbelievable struggle. I don't really know 
what to do about money. Somewhere in the back of my mind 
there's this voice telling me that I should stop looking 
for a job or employment or whatever, and, that I should 
focus on trying to make money doing stock market shit.

Reflection # 714 by Chestnut and Hazel

I don't know exactly what I've been spending on buying lunch and soda at work, 
but I know that it is too damn much, I want to say it is around 15 dollars per day. 
Too fucking much. I have to cut down on that for sure.

By Chestnut + Hazel at June 11, 2019 

Notes written on 10/10/2023 @ 10:19 AM, 
originally posted on GitHub

I think that I wrote this post while I was working 
at Case New Holland. I'm surprised that I was 
really spending that much. I 
Wonder what I was buying? I don't really remember. 
I think that it was mostly energy drinks. I don't 
remember my exact hours. 
It was overnight is as much as I remember. In 
Cameron, MO there isn't really much to eat if 
you're up at odd hours.

I'm working on Project 11 for my Web and Software 
Development course. I'm not really getting much 
done. I'm getting sidetracked
with other things. I'm really amazed that I get so 
little done, especially considering that I've had 
few other obligations other
than class these past few months. I really 
wonder what I've been doing.

Earlier in the course I would have a 
lot of fun playing around with our 
daily assignments, but, I haven't really 
done that in a
while, even though there have been plenty 
of opportunities to do so.

155

I don't really remember what those
old posts are about.

156

not off the top of my head anyway.

157

Life is such a nightmare right now. My expenses have increased, 
and my income has decreased, and I'm really not seeing any 
kind of light at the end of the tunnel.

Life is such a nightmare, but I'm not sure it's really ever been easy.

158

I'm trying to think. Today is Sunday. I feel like I wasted the 
entire day. In fact, it's actually already Monday.

159

I kind of blew off one of my professional development projects, the 
last one, but I didn't realize that it was required for passing the 
course, so I requested a redo of that project.

160

I feel like there is something that I need to do 
right now, but I'm not sure what that is.

161

I'm failing MIS 768
I'm going to audit MIS 768
I don't know if the instructor would 
allow me to re-take the course, but 
even if she did, I don't know if I can 
take a risk like that again. 

162

I feel like there is something 
that I need to do right now, 
but I'm not sure what that is.

163

I was thinking about the 
aphorism: "the hardest part is getting started"

i thought that it was actually 
a quote from Robert Coover's short 
story "In be one night and other brief encounters"

but um it's something people actually 
say, you know, people say that the hardest 
part is getting started.

anyway

the more i thought about it
the more
i thought that

you know
that it could mean two things

on the one hand. it could mean that
the most difficult part in any process is 
getting the process started

and also
that 

the most difficult part of the process is about to get started.

i'm working on project 9 for my class. i'm almost done.
the hardest part. was actually realizing the fact that I 
have to reference my javascript file in the body of my html 
file, and not the head. it was working fine, but, um. the 

i'm taking a break.

164

I should be starting a new position 
soon. Thank god. I've been bored out 
of my mind, and kind of losing focus. 
it's been about a month and three weeks.

165

I'm so tired. My sleep cycle has shifted over the 
past few weeks. I'm still worried about not landing 
a position yet. I'm depleting my savings, and for me, 
that's not really ideal.

166

I still haven't landed a position yet, and I'm under a 
little bit of stress as a result. I can't believe I 
didn't get approved for unemployment.

167

best of all the places you've been
are better than the places you haven't been.
and you won't go anywhere new for the foreseeable future.

now and then you will
find something interesting.
and most of all they are more interesting
than the things that you haven't come across.

and you will drive across the country and find new things
that are interesting
and that you will be happy to see and 
you will enjoy them.

I know what to do now, like going 
forward and stuff. I'm going to say this:


"Yeah, I know a whole bunch of stuff, 
all the craziest dirt and everything. 
Basically. I have all the information 
you need, even the things that other 
people don't know, and even the things 
that other people couldn't even imagine."

maybe you know the things that you haven't
already learned so you will learn them.

here
and again
you see it over and
over and think that
the new things are
nonsensical, but they
actually make sense.

168

what is one of the things that makes Door Dashing hard?
customers who say they never got their order. 
one thing that almost all of the refund fraudsters that I've 
had to deal with is that during the drop off, they make 
a variation to the original instructions. if they say they 
want it to be a contactless delivery, you'll see them standing 
right at the door or at the street waiting for there order, or 
if they say hand it to me, they ask you to leave it at there door.

169

I don't really have much to write about. 
I'm writing because. I guess. I want to keep this 
updated, but I really don't have anything to write 
about. I had a few interview over the past few weeks, 
but, nothing has really materialized.

170


Where are the times
that the people who
where here
are not here anymore

when they left to the other side of the
universe.

171

I removed Steam from my taskbar. Nightmare. I can't get 
anything done when I get so distracted by other useless 
stuff. This is silly, but I have to stay off there. 
There are other things that I could be doing, and should be doing.

The current module in class is WordPress. I had trouble, or, 
maybe just hesitation at first, but it's actually a whole lot 
easier than I initially thought, so I'm not as overwhelmed as 
I was at first. It's not always clear what I'm doing is basically 
my issue with WordPress, but, I almost want to say it's the same 
way when I make pages using HTML and CSS to make them, it's just 
that I've gotten more familiar creating pages by writing them, 
and grabbing and dragging is somewhat new.

172

What do I have to do? I don't have any major assignments 
due tomorrow, but I have to get these modules on WordPress 
done because we are going to move into new content.

173

For some reason I can't seem to really get my thoughts together 
to get very much of my course work done. I did get the last two 
projects completed, but only after quite a bit of procrastination, 
followed by quite a bit of pressure from an impending due date. I'm 
not really behind, but I'm not really ahead, and I'm not really 
getting ahead.

The pressure to land a position is increasing. It isn't clear to me 
where I stand with the temp agency, I did get new hire paperwork, but, 
I'm not sure if that necessarily means I have a position, or a paid 
assignment just yet. I've only worked with a temp agency a few other 
times. Each one is kind of different.

other times. Each one is kind of different.

178

I managed to get my project finished, although, 
not without a lot of procrastination. For some 
reason I keep getting sucked-in to playing 
computer games. Huge waste of time. Today is 
after Labor Day. I had an interview with a temp 
agency and a logistics company the other day, but, 
I don't know where I stand. I'll follow up when I get a chance.

I get less and less enthusiastic about this 
blog as time goes on. Well, maybe that's not totally 
true. I guess. I just really have less time for it right now.

179

I'm getting worried about coming up on a 
second month out-of-work. I didn't get 
approved for unemployment, so, I'm basically 
just staying home for now. Not doing anything 
other than my course work and. I did a little 
day trading yesterday, but, it didn't amount to 
much. I didn't lose anything, and that's always good.

Caffeine keeps me up, 
but it doesn't give me 
motivation. I've been 
procrastinating with some 
of the stuff for class.

180

Today is labor day and I've stayed 
up overnight, and I haven't had any 
sleep, and I haven't got any work done.

181

Today is the first day in a long while 
that I've been up during the day, where 
it wasn't, where I wasn't just carrying 
on from the night before. I'm still worried 
about the next few weeks and months, since, 
I'm not working, but I'm not as stressed out 
about it as I usually am, or, as stressed out 
about it as I was a while ago. I almost had 
an interview the other day, but the recruiter 
never confirmed the interview date and time. 
I thought about just showing up, but then, 
I later thought it would be weird.

183

I missed my appointment with my career counselor 
the other day, and I was so tired, that I didn't 
show up for class, even though it was just a Zoom 
session. Same thing, I was playing Sim City, and 
that was an issue, and the other thing was that I 
was staying up late trying to set up my GitHub 
website, it took forever, and the issue turned 
out nothing that I was able to fix, the issue was 
that my account was messed up, so I had to create 
a new account. I don't know what the specific cause 
of the issue was, but as far as I can tell, it had 
something to do with the email address that I used 
to sign up for an account. It's less likely to get 
flagged if you use something like a signup with a 
Gmail account. So that's what I did, the other issue 
may have been with my account name, which had hyphens. 
and it was really long as well.

184

I've been wasting a little bit of time playing 
Sim City. Well. It's actually a lot of time that 
I've wasted playing the game. I've been in an 
unhappy mood these last few days, and I'm not 
really in any position to do anything super 
interesting. My fortune cookie the other day. 
I went out for Chinese food. Said: There are no 
bad journeys, only lessons learned. I don't know 
if that was supposed to encourage me or what.

185

I'm feeling a little better than I was earlier. 
I've applied for a few more roles. a few more positions. 
I'm worried about things. about the next few months. I'm 
annoyed by how often. like. my plans to get ahead always 
seem to hit a brick wall. things just aren't really easy 
for me. this is such a headache. such a disappointment. 
I'm feeling somewhat discouraged.
 
186

My head is in a million different places 
right now. I'm in such an absolute funk right now.

187

I have my hearing today. yet another nightmare. 
I'm frustrated right now. Irritated.

188

I'm so tired. I don't think that I really 
did anything today. after the first application, 
I went on to complete 2 more, and an assessment. 
I went to the buffet around the corner. I don't 
know. I feel like I do the same stuff over and 
over. but oh well. I guess that's the way it is for now.

I don't know why I didn't but more sodas when 
I was at the gas station earlier. Right now 
I'm more thirsty than I've ever been. So thirsty.

Guess what? I drank water! it was so good.

I'm in a weird mood.

Everything is kind of a 
nightmare right now. like 
a real nightmare. I wish 
things we easy. or at least. easier.

One thing I made easier for myself 
is to keep my keyboard backlight on. 
this is nice. since I'm always up at 
night. during the day, though, I'm always 
working kind of in the dark.

What do I still want? Like. Is there anything 
I still want that I've wanted for a while.

189

I submitted 1 application 
today. i think one of the 
things that kind of makes me nervous 
is when there are a number of programs 
or applications listed in the post that 
I'm not familiar with. A lot of these 
positions, or, at least the positions 
that stick out to me, have to do with 
casino games, or slot machines.

190

I need to look for work, and I need to 
find something, I need to land something. 
I feel a little bit worried. well. I actually 
feel a little more than just a little worried. 
I haven't looked for work or applied for a job in  
a while.

191

I need to land a job, and I'm 
starting to worry about it. I 
need something that pays. like 
real money.

192

Some things are just too weird. 
some coincidences are just too 
coincidental. sometimes things 
line up in strange ways that seem. 
weird. like i wonder how that happened.

193

Version 4 - 7 of my project is 
responsive. It fits mobile screens.

194

I was able to find something to eat.

195

It's midnight and I'm really 
kind of hungry. I want to go 
out to eat, I want to find 
something to eat.

196

I don't really have much to write 
about. I've just been working on 
my coursework and assignments and 
projects for my class. I've been 
basically goofing off with this 
Jennifer Connelly project. All day, 
and a few hours from the previous day. 
I think that I worked overnight on this.

197

I don't know what to do about my MIS 768 
Repository. I'm thinking about dismatleing it 
and relocating the material to my main repository.

198

I need to land a job,

I've been basically goofing off with this 
Jennifer Connelly project. All day, and a 
few hours from the previous day. I think 
that I worked overnight on this.

204

I created an aspect ratio of 8.68 / 6.08

205

I'm not really in a good mood. I'm tired. 
I'm cranky. I'm worried about the future 
and all that. This is a headache.

206

I'm super tired. I didn't really do 
anything today. I attended class, 
which is via Zoom, so, it's not like 
that's really physically demanding, 
but, I'm otherwise really tired.

207

I don't. a little bit of hard stuff. 
trouble. this is difficult. nightmare.

208

I woke up at around 2 PM this afternoon. 
I was really tired, so I went to the buffet 
to go out and eat. I bought and drank a 
few energy drinks, but I'm not any more 
energized or awake than I was 2 hours ago, 
it's 4 PM as I am writing this. I'm thinking 
about taking kind of a long shower or 
something. doing my homework.

209

I'm trying to think right now. 
I'm in a strange mood right now. 
I'm irritated about a few things.

210

I'm a little bit hungry right 
now, and I want to eat something. 
kind of. I want to eat something 
from the gas station. 

211

I feel like going out and doing 
something. Like real. I feel 
like going out on a road trip 
or something.

212

I don't know what kind of a day this is. 
Lazy. I'm feeling lazy. and that's pretty 
much it. I'm going to apply for a few more 
roles. but I don't know what to look for.

This most recent assignment was really cool. I had fun.

213

these are really
the most boring things 
that I can think of 
right now.

214

I'm trying to get my energy 
together to get myself to work 
on something, but, I'm just not 
there yet. I'm tired. I usually 
work from maybe 10 PM to early in 
the morning, last night I stopped 
after being kind of discouraged, 
and then, sort of 
figured out the issue.

215

I'm incredibly tired. I just came back 
from the museum, and I went out and did 
a bunch of other stuff as well, but 
nothing major, I just went out to eat. 
and that's it.

216

Today is my birthday. I booked a visit to 
the natural history museum. I actually wanted 
to go yesterday,  but for whatever reason it 
wasn't available. I wanted to go Sunday, but 
Sunday wasn't an option. maybe it's not open 
on Sunday? who knows. I really don't want to 
go anymore. I'm not really feeling okay. I'm 
experiencing quite a bit of anxiety about the 
future. I don't even want to go to the museum today.

217

I'm already tired compiling this massive poem.

It's impossible to get anything done 
during the day. for me anyway. I'm about 
to go to sleep. and I feel like my 
Monday is already gone. total nightmare.

Well. it turned out not to be too bad of a 
monday. I went into chinatown and ate a few 
sandwiches. but I am tired, and, most of the 
monday is gone.

221

Quite a bit of stress. There are a lot of things 
on my mind right now. This. is a nightmare. I guess 
that the only thing that I have to worry about is my 
class, my web development class, and, well, I don't 
know what else. Oh man what a total nightmare. I'm 
worried. What a disaster. What a nightmare. I'm super 
tired. I applied for something through LinkedIn. I want 
to go do something. Get out of the house, but I haven't 
gone anywhere more than a few blocks away from home. The 
gas station. The other gas station. The grocery store. 
Such a nightmare. Such a disaster. I'm in a lousy sort of 
garbage mood. I sent out a few resumes and applications 
through LinkedIn, and I've never done that before, so this 
is new. Life is a total nightmare for me right now. I feel 
so discouraged. I know that I should be thinking of things, 
these difficulties, whatever is going on right now, as an 
opportunity. but I'm really discouraged.

Monday and Tuesday are free for me. My birthday is coming 
up. I haven't done anything for my birthday in the longest 
time. It's just something I haven't celebrated in a while. 
I just can't stop thinking about how everything is a disaster 
right now. a total disaster. I'm really hoping this is all for 
the best. It's just that it might be a while before I'm at that 
point, where I can say this all happened for the best. When my 
nails are even just a few days long, when they've been growing 
for just a few days, or when I haven't cut them for a few days 
I find that it's hard, or, maybe just awkward, to type. It's 
hard. It's uncomfortable to type when I have just a few days 
of nail growth. Job search. nightmare. I'm worried about these 
next few months. I'm worried about these next few weeks. 
constantly anxious, and I can't really get my thoughts together.

222

I had quite a bit of fun with my most recent class 
assignment. I have to figure out what the requirements 
for the 3rd project, but I think that everything that 
is due tomorrow, all the homework assignments, are 
completed. I also have to get around to filing an appeal 
of my termination, and I have to think about where to apply 
and how to apply for work, and I have to prepare for some 
kind of thing regarding unemployment.

223

A nice clean laptop screen is now mine. It's nice. I like it. 
I can really see now. I'm really surprised with how good it looks. 
I rubbed it with rubbing alcohol, and it's really clean, and 
everything looks really visible. Years ago, when I moved to Missouri, 
I cleaned my computer with water, and it fucked things up, and I didn't 
really have money for a new computer for a while. I still get emails 
from coin companies, marketing emails to see if I want to buy anything, 
and, the answer is kind of yes, but for whatever reason, I think that 
silver coins are sometimes bad luck.

224

What did I work on today? well, the course has a kind of running project 
that I'm working on, and that's basically what I worked on today. Visually 
speaking, my fourth version of my project, Project 3-4, isn't very different 
from my third version of my project, Project 3-3, but for whatever reason it 
feels like I spent a lot of time doing the things that I did manage to do.

Visual Studio and GitHub. I have to set those two 
things up for my class and coursework. I'm so 
hungry right now. I need to get something to eat.

I went out to eat. I thought about heading to 
Chinatown and finding something to eat there, but, I'm 
just too tired. and at the time I was just too hungry. 
I'm so tired. I hung out last night. In retrospect I would 
have been better just staying home. Last night was a disaster.

Well, I have a real desk. This is nice. I'm trying 
to get all my thoughts together, finding focus. 
I like rolling over my 401k into my IRA. I don't 
like switching employers, but I like roll overs. 
It does give me more control and flexibility with 
things. I'm trying to think about worst case 
scenarios for the next few weeks to come, for the 
weeks and months ahead. One thing I don't want to think 
about are those times with things are worse than I thought 
they would be in a worst case scenario.

228

What do I do? I got an email from. you know. 
the company that fired me stating that I can 
request an appeal to my termination. I'm going 
to do it, but I have no idea how to approach the 
whole thing. This is a headache. I got my final 
checks from work, or, well, I saw that they were 
issued today, I didn't actually get them, in my 
bank account or anything. I've been spending too 
much money over the last few days, and my spending 
is something that I really have to take down to, you 
know, something lower than it currently is. It's hot, 
I'm always sweating and I always feel somewhat greasy.

229

There are a few things in life that are just a little 
bit too strange. Like what? well, I applied for unemployment 
here in Nevada and I see that the last person I contacted 
for work was. someone. not here in Las Vegas, maybe a while 
ago, but not any more. or maybe. I wouldn't really know. 
I've tried to stay away from that part of town. I don't 
know what to do about the job search. I want to try using 
LinkedIn to look for work. I don't want to do anything too 
physically demanding if I can avoid it. How to stay in shape? 
I don't really know, I was getting fat anyway.

234

Going on a road trip is kind of on my mind right now. but it's not really a 
good idea when I think about it. I just got canned. I should be looking for 
work. but what kind of work should I be looking for?

235

Totally got canned today. by email. and in this case the nightmare is over, 
because the nightmare already just happened. there's like, impending doom, the 
moment of doom, and what happens after the moment of doom, and that's where 
I'm at right now: post-doom. I don't know what to do. This is a disaster. 
Total nightmare. I have no idea about what to do. I worked on one of the other 
assignments for my programming class, and it looks really cool. I don't know 
what to do work-wise.

236

This last assignment for my software and web development course was 
just too fun. It took me forever, but I was able to get everything 
working, and I think the iframes below should work. I'm really dreading 
going back to work, and I'm also really dreading the idea that my last 
day at work is just around the corner.

237

I have no idea what kind of position to be looking for. I really 
want to take a nap right now. I don't know what's going to happen 
as far as work goes. I have to remember that this could be an opportunity 
to do something new, and, that's something I should look forward to. 
I don't have a resume. I haven't been to an interview in forever. I don't 
know where to begin. This is a nightmare. I was able to track down some 
old files on an older laptop that I have. I don't know why this older laptop 
is so slow, I bought it last year, but from the very beginning it just didn't 
work very quickly. Moving the files took about an hour, and I want to say that 
the total number of files was around 20,000 at maybe 200 GB, and I really don't 
think that's a lot of stuff to move, it was just from my computers internal storage 
to an external storage device. an hour. really.

238

I am already tired of compiling this document
or putting together this massive, epic poem of mine!
tired really tired.

239

Not really feeling all that fabulous. I've been using 
some of the dating apps again, but, being on those things 
makes me unhappy more often than it makes me happy. They 
depress me more than they elevate my mood in any way. This 
dating app stuff really makes me unhappy, and maybe that's 
the whole idea. I don't want to do it, I want to get off 
these dating apps, and I think that I will.

Working and and reworking some of my course projects 
turned out to be very enjoyable. I think that I took 
it in one direction, and then wanted to go back and 
take it in a slightly different direction. I want to 
continue to try a few things, but we are already moving 
on to new things, and I still want to play around with 
it. I think that if I started on it sooner, than I could 
have spent more time playing around with it, but I more 
or less just started on it this morning.

There are 3 copyright registrations pending, 
and 1 trademark registration pending for 
Chestnut + Hazel. This should be kind of cool. 
I'm really unhappy about all the dating app 
stuff. I really want to delete these things. 
I'm not happy with them. I don't know what to 
do with them, mothball them maybe. I'm really 
not feeling well, at all, everything is just a 
total nightmare. dread. everything. is not going 
well. I don't know what on earth to do about work. 
My inclination is to wait until I'm canned before 
I do any job search kind of stuff. My suspension 
ends on August 8th, and at that point I'll know if 
I'm going to get canned, or if I'm going to go back 
to work. I haven't done well in the 8 or whatever 
weeks I've been at this new location.

and it's not like starting today with any job search 
is really going to give me any kind of advantage. 3 
or 4 days or whatever is not a huge head start.

240

So Chestnut + Hazel officially has a trademark 
pending. It might be a year before I hear anything 
back from the US PTO. There are also a few copyright 
registrations that I have pending, and in my 
experience, those could take about four months to process.

With all the other stuff I have going on, the disasters, 
the impending disasters. I'm going to dig into my homework 
that's due tomorrow, and see where that goes. there are so 
many things going on, so many things going wrong that I 
really don't know where to begin. So close. I had these 
credit cards on the way to zero, and now this. I'm frozen 
right now, not in the sense that I'm immobile, or stuck 
in place, but I have things to do that I just haven't 
done yet. so. I'm just here.

So I'm working on one of my class projects, and it was 
pretty interesting. I spent too much time on this last 
thing, working with padding, margins, and borders. I 
integrated the new concepts into a previous project, 
and created and messed around with some of the buttons 
that I created.

241

This chair that I'm sitting on 
right now is falling apart 
structurally.

242

What a mood I'm in! I don't 
really feel all that great 
right now. I did laundry, I 
cleaned my card. I registered 
a copyright and a trademark, 
or, it has to be awarded, so I 
guess I submitted the applications 
for registration. I'm worried about 
the prospect of getting canned from 
work. Getting canned is something 
that I should take as an opportunity, 
to do something else, to try something 
new, but it's not something I'm really 
prepared for. Credit Card wise, I'd be 
back in minimum payment mode. I was so 
close, and now it all falls apart again. 
I need to finish my homework for class. 
The thing is. I have no idea what to 
do about class if I have to start 
looking for work again, because, I 
prefer working nights, but it isn't 
clear to me what else is out there working 
nights.

243

Years ago, like a decade ago really, like ten years ago or more, 
I remember wanting to work at a casino, but I never did it, this 
was when I was living in San Jose, CA, and there were a number of 
card houses in the area, and, I think at the time a new card house 
completed construction. I don't really go into casinos, I don't really 
gamble, and so I don't really no much about them. Last year when I went 
on my road trips from Texas to Michigan I came across tons of casinos, 
it's really surprising how many there are, there's not the concentration 
of casinos out there like there are here in Las Vegas, NV, but they are 
out there, and you see them every so often.

244

This is kind of a headache. I think that I bit off more than I can chew.
I don't know what other things to put into this Epic Adventure Poem of mine.

245

There was one in Michigan, I think, somewhere close to Battle Creek, MI 
that I stopped at and checked out, mostly for the restaurants, I stayed 
at the less expensive motel across the street. I played a few games of 
some kind of card game, but, I don't remember what it was called, or what 
it was or what the rules were, I just chatted with the card dealer and 
kind of got a feeling of what the role is like.

246

This is a little bit of a nightmare. I can't really think right now. 
There are so many things on my mind right now that I'm worried about, 
and my thoughts skip from one thing to another. I want to finish my 
coursework today, but I also need to finish my course work today.

247

So it's kind of back to square one, I'm kind of back to the drawing 
board on the Chestnut and Hazel logo or trademark. Some of the newer 
things that I've tried don't really succeed as a favicon, and that really 
plays into it. The success or the failure of the design of the trademark 
logo hinges upon whether or not it looks nice as a favicon, and there 
really isn't much to work with when it comes to a favicon. I'm working 
on this design pixel by pixel, by hand, and part of the reason I'm doing 
this is to make sure that I can obtain a copyright, and eventually a trademark.

the rules were, I just chatted with the card dealer and kind of got a feeling of what the role is like.

251

This is a little bit of a nightmare. I can't really think right 
now. There are so many things on my mind right now that I'm 
worried about, and my thoughts skip from one thing to another. 
I want to finish my coursework today, but I also need to finish 
my course work today.

252

So it's kind of back to square one, I'm kind of back to the drawing 
board on the Chestnut and Hazel logo or trademark. Some of the newer 
things that I've tried don't really succeed as a favicon, and that 
really plays into it. The success or the failure of the design of the 
trademark logo hinges upon whether or not it looks nice as a favicon, 
and there really isn't much to work with when it comes to a favicon. 
I'm working on this design pixel by pixel, by hand, and part of the 
reason I'm doing this is to make sure that I can obtain a copyright, 
and eventually a trademark.

48 Logos and Logo Elements for Chestnut + Hazel

Updating titles to some of my blog posts, mostly just 
taking posts that are Archived Content posts and shoving 
them into the nearest series of posts, Reflections from 
Chestnut Street or Letters from Sanford Street or whatever. 
There is the issue of work. I was at two write-ups, and now 
I'm on suspension. I don't know what on earth to do, even if, 
somehow, I end up keeping my position, there is still the issue 
of things not really becoming easier at work. Things just 
haven't become easier.

255

Around 2 PM yesterday I stopped at a motel about 100 miles 
outside of Las Vegas and stopped to rest. It's 3 AM right now. 
I thought about heading home early but there's no key drop off 
so I guess I'll finish out my stay. I missed 2 days of work, 
this isn't the end of the world, but it's definitely sub-optimal. 
I wanted to see the Utah Natural History Museum, but I couldn't 
figure out how to get tickets from their website, and 3rd party 
websites didn't offer them either. Plus, it wasn't open at 6 AM or 
whatever, so I headed back home because I was really in a shitty mood. 
I did consider continuing on to Boise, Idaho, thinking that I might 
still be able to go in to work, well, I didn't make it. I might try 
this again, but who knows.

256

Maybe I'll just say it the way it is. 
I'm feeling unbelievably depressed. 
Like real bad. An unshakable melancholy 
that won't go the fuck away. I'm really 
glad I did this because as soon as I get 
back to Las Vegas I'm setting up a doctor's 
appointment. There's no reason for me to feel 
this unhappy. None. 

But right now, I don't really know what 
to do. I really want to take. Nap but 
check in isn't until 230. I could be back 
in Vegas by that time.

I'm so unhappy. 
It comes out of nowhere. 
I don't know what the fuck causes it. 

It has to be some kind of chemical imbalance. 
If I have no reason to feel sad, 
and feel sad out of nowhere, 
then there's really no other fucking explanation.

Anyway. Salt Lake City is kind of nice, 
between Provo and Salt Lake City there's a 
town that really felt like Overland Park, Kansas.

That was quick. my phone is now covered in cracks, and it looks like a spider web.

The Best Haircut (2023)

Hello Earth! Moon! Mars! & Venus!
What I thought was a haircut turned out
not to be a haircut. it was. actually.
just. hair.

hiding behind the neck.
hair hides behind the neck
and plays

hide and seek.
or maybe
MARCO ! POLO !
no hair is the same as hairless
no hare is a tortoise.
FASTER! slower. FASTER! FASTER! FASTER!

Harder? like the shell of a tortoise?
NO! just FASTER!
My home
is on Audrey Hepburn Street!

where else could I possibly live?

Things I like about my home
foremost among those things I like about my home

is that Audrey Hepburn is always here

and in the neighborhood I like that we have

places Audrey Hepburn likes to eat
places Audrey Hepburn likes to go
places Audrey Hepburn likes to see

The Best Haircut (2023) by Kenneth Larot Yamat dba Chestnut + Hazel
"The Best Haircut" is actually a poem about Marianne Shaffer

Letters to Katastrophiena # 6
Publication Date 07/21/2023

I really would like to file a copyright for just 
that one poem, rather than having it ride inside The Epic Adventures
of Chestnut + Hazel.

I'm trying to think. I have class until noon today, then I go into 
work at 6 pm, or slightly after. there is really no time for me to 
do anything until the weekend. or, well, my weekend, which is in 
the middle of the week.

kenneth

what?

what are you working on?

i'm not working on anything. 
i know that i should be working on 
something, but, i'm goofing off. 
well. i'm working on my blog. so 
i am. actually. working on something.

are you doing anything next week?
i'm thinking about the salt lake city thing again.
i'm not sure if it's as exciting as you imagine it to be.
so?

if you're trying to enjoy yourself, you should 
aim to have the most fun with the least effort.

263

i thought
that it was
entertaining that
you were
in time
for cornflakes

i never really
thought you
liked cornflakes

i thought that
you were more

"The Best Stuff is not Stuffing" (2023)

The Best Stuff is not Stuffing
The best things that are for thanksgiving

could be called green bean casserole and
candied yams,
but not stuffing
you see, stuffing is a verb

and not a noun
and therefore not a thing
and therefore cannot be among the best things
because stuffing is a verb and it is not a noun

and therefore not a thing
and as a consequence cannot be among the best things

265

when those things are 
changed and transformed into
the new things that
have been or where
or what
have you been
when the test of the
multiple choices

266

hear the things
that have been said
before
and here 
are the things that are
written on the back of
where you were when you had been the best

267

how are the best things
that you can think of being
used to be the best of the things
that you think are the less of the 
comparison

and that's what the things
you think of as being the best
of the least common
aspects of things you hear
when you taste the
you know what.

268

Lately I haven't felt the really deep sadness 
that I've been struggling with for quite a 
few months, but right now I feel like it can 
head in that direction.

269

One of the pairs of jeans that I bought is 
just plain white. They were already dirty by 
the time I got home and put them on, but they 
are very comfortable for some reason. I think 
that dyes can change how cotton fabrics feel, 
I'm not sure if there is a difference when it 
comes to synthetic fabrics.

Yeah, these jeans are really comfortable. 
I'm really surprised with how comfortable they are.

270

I bought two pairs of jeans, two pairs of 
pants. three shirts, two of which have 
shirt pockets, and two pairs of shoes.

271

I bought a shirt. It's kind of small. 
well. Actually. It is small, but it's 
smaller than I thought it would be.

272

Kenneth. write this down. Forget about salt 
lake city temporarily. Stay local for now. do 
some in-person shopping to get out and explore.

273

Lately I haven't felt the really deep sadness 
that I've been struggling with for quite a few 
months, but right now I feel like it can head 
in that direction.

274

Kenneth
what
did you notice anything today
yeah
what did you notice?
tabasco sauce.

and where is tabasco sauce made?
i'm not going to answer that.
yes you are

louisiana
remember that.

anyway. I usually eat my burritos with sweet and sour sauce.
yeah, that bothers me.
why do you care?
i don't.

275

Right now I'm not feeling unhappy, 
or angry, or manic, or anxious, or 
worried. I'm kind of centered right 
now and this is kind of nice.

276

I've been up for about 2 hours, or 
what feels like 2 hours, it's actually 
only been an hour and a half, but it feels 
like I haven't done anything. I tidied up, 
and took a shower and did some grooming and 
laundry, these don't always feel like real 
accomplishments, but they are things that 
need to be done, and I honestly want to spend 
more time, I want to dedicate more time to 
looking good. or at least looking like I actually 
put in time to. look more or less. I think I 
want to look like I put some thought into it, 
and I put some effort into it, but not in a way 
that's extremely high-maintenance or anything and 
in a way that's clearly not high-maintenance.

277

Maybe to put it another way. I want to look 
very nice in a way that is very efficient and 
also looks very efficient. One issue I'm having 
right now is actually. Pants.

278

I really want to file 
a patent for some kind of 
useful software program.

I'm failing MIS 768
and I'm trying to salvage whatever 
time I've spent and whatever money 
I've spent to take the course. 

There isn't an absolution clause in 
the MIS 768 syllabus that states:
"All your academic sins are washed away 
when you file a patent during the course of 
this class."

when I say that I'm trying to salvage the situation 
what I mean is. Getting a good grade, like an A in 
the course would be an asset, but obtaining a patent 
after creating something useful from the knowlege I'd 
obtained while taking the course would create an actual 
asset.

I good grade is an asset in a figurative sense

280

So many emails and I'm 
really nobody notable.

Anyway, pants. I kind of want to 
have a 2 week supply of pants, but 
I'm not sure I really need that many. 
It's just that some times. I don't 
really need 14 pairs of pants, It's 
just sometimes I don't always have 
the time to do laundry every week.

281

I guess what I want in a pair of pants 
is a shorter inseam and more of a taper, 
without it being a slim fit. The length 
of the inseam isn't something I worried 
about when I wore boots, but I don't really 
wear boots that much anymore so the inseam matters.

282

It's midnight, lunchtime, and I feel kind of unhappy. 
There is a brick inside my chest. A stack of bricks. I 
don't know what causes this. It oscillates. My mood 
oscillates from irritated to unhappy. Over and over. Sad 
to grouchy and grouchy to sad and over and over and I have 
no idea why.

287

To the Divine One who
holds dominion over
all those things
that can and usually do go wrong 
for me

yesterday was agonizing
and
i'm sure there's a time 
and place
and purpose 
for everything

i'm sure there are times when it's
appropriate to torture
kenneth

but i'm also sure there's an
appropriate time
to show kenneth mercy

things have been more or less downhill since february of 2022, and, 
maybe things have become a little bit better since i left texas and 
came back to nevada, but it has been at kind of a snail's pace and i 
honestly consider this a form of torture. i think. that. the time for 
delivering mercy. unto kenneth. is at hand. divine one.

anyway. i registered the domain katastrophiena.com and um, i think i'll 
finally get around to registering a few trademarks.

I didn't get much sleep this morning. I was busy 
setting up the new domain and emails for it and 
doing a little writing that I found that it was 
noon before I even got a chance to lay down and 
rest. So I'm at six hours of sleep for the day 
which is a lot less than usual but I'll see how 
this goes.

The fact that I had so many energy drinks the day 
before may have also played into it as well. It's 
hot. Really hot, and it's hot enough that the AC in 
my car accomplishes almost nothing when it's running. 
I don't remember it being this hot the last time I was 
in Vegas five years ago.

No ideas but inside 
every idea is a new idea 
and there are shells of new ideas 
and there are no ideas but inside 
things called brains and there are no 
images except in a PNG format and
she was not wearing any panties and 
for one reason or another I did not 
make a move on her.

293

This is the way it goes. and this 
is the way it will always be.
and this is the wonder that's keeping 
your thighs apart: I carry your panties.
I carry them in my left pocket!

294

Anyway, I'm blank right now. I can't 
really think about. I can't really 
figure out what to do. I don't really 
know what I would do in the event that 
I had to, or would have to look for a 
new job. I really don't. I don't really 
even have a resume. I think. I haven't 
really been motivated to look for anything 
new, and I haven't really been interested 
in looking for anything new.

295

Before I left Arlington I applied for and 
received an offer for an outside sales role. 
I don't know if it's still referred to as 
outside sales. I didn't take it because it 
would have. I wouldn't have been able to go 
to college and work. The scheduling wouldn't 
work. That one incomplete semester set me back 
ten thousand bucks, and, in retrospect I probably 
should have taken the job. I remember seeing their 
headquarters building in Nashville during that first 
road trip through the Midwest. I can't really do 
anything this year. I'm so damn far behind.

Yeah, I don't really know what I would 
do if I had to start looking for work again. 
I did take a look the other day, but, I didn't 
send out any applications, and, no resumes since 
I don't have one. There was one opening that 
really caught my eye, but I kind of just want to 
stay where I'm at and see what develops. If I 
were to get canned I'll just take it as an 
opportunity to try something new.

296

I'm trying to figure out where to start. 
I'm thinking that I should look at a number 
of positions, and seeing what qualifications 
are required, and then seeing what kind of 
educational or technical or vocational 
training I need. I'm really kind of averse 
to working during the day.

297

This is the last day of the work week. 
That went really fast. It usually doesn't 
go by that fast. I did sign up for 
overtime this week. A half shift in the 
middle of my weekend, and that's both a 
good thing and a not-so-good thing. It has 
positives and negatives. On the one hand it 
breaks my weekend, but on the other, it doesn't 
lengthen my workweek the way it would if it were 
at the beginning or at the end of my workweek.

I've been thinking about going somewhere, 
not anywhere too far, but I'm not really 
sure if I should or not.

298

i imagined you called me
and asked me to coffee
i imagined zero things i'd rather do

I went to the buffet yesterday. 
I got a fortune cookie and I feel 
like fortune cookies are my, secondary 
of course, but almost a second primary 
reason for going to the buffet. I was 
disappointed with what it said because 
it didn't feel like it really meant 
anything to me. it said something like: 
an optimistic heart clears the path to 
victory. and I'm not even sure how that's 
relevant to me.

My work week isn't that long. 
I work four days a week. nights.

My work
week isn't
that
long.

302

here you are again. I see you.
you are looking at me, but guess what!
I AM ALSO LOOKING AT YOU!

303

It's the last work 
day of the week.

304

These Facebook memories feel 
weird to look at. Fort Smith, 
Arkansas; Azle, Texas; Beaverlick, 
Kentucky; Holladay, Tennessee; Cameron 
Missouri; Sunnyvale, California.

It's weird because maybe life really 
does happen in cycles. I thought 
about taking a road trip the 
other day, not because I 
wanted to, but out of 
frustration, to kind 
of blow off steam.

I realized that I 
really don't go anywhere 
or even get out of the house 
unless I'm frustrated with something.

305

Well, 
I put it all in an index fund, 
and, 
I'm just going to leave it where it is.

306

I don't think I created a good 
faith violation with my IRA, but 
I'm not really when I'll know for 
sure. Well, two days from now I guess. 
I'm going to day trade tomorrow, but 
I'm going to take it slow, play it safe, 
and not let my emotions get the better of me.

307

not sure but there 
are more spiders than there are 
insects in the mouths 
of birds that fly 
around and eat spiders 
and other insects. it's true!

I'm thinking about what 
to do about my IRA, like, 
I'm thinking about what I 
should do next. Now that 
I've closed out my position 
in VFC, I can really do 
something else. I'm not here 
trying to grind my way into a 
profit, or, out of a loss or 
whatever. I'm irritated because 
I spent so much time trying to 
make it work, and now it's just over.

308

On the one hand I'm thinking that 
maybe this is the point where it 
would have turned around, and I 
could have existed without a loss, 
or, even have made some money, on 
the other hand, VFC could just as 
easily have dropped to 8.00 a share, 
in fact, I think I was strategizing 
on how to deal with that exact situation, 
but, then it started turning around.

What did the fortune cookie say?

"The universe is aligning 
to bring you a soulmate connection."

and I'm just thinking: 
yeah, sure it is.

When I think about how that all 
turned out, like, I would have 
been better off just getting a 
second job or something, but that 
wouldn't work either because I'm 
really just too tired to work two jobs.

309

I've cleaned 
up my car quite a 
bit, but I still 
have quite a bit of 
stuff in there that 
I don't know what to do 
with, or that I haven't 
made a decision on how to 
deal with. I had shoes and 
clothes in there that I hadn't 
taken out for months.

So after cleaning up all of the posts that were flagged, 
I got another notice that the issue has been flagged again, 
and so I have to spend time looking through my blog again 
and figure out where all the offending posts are.  

This is somewhat difficult given that there are so many 
posts for me to look through.

314

So it's everything after the Letters from Sanford Street 
that I can add to this Epic Poem of the Epic Adventures of 
Chestnut + Hazel.

315

Here are the best of the
worst of the last of the 
newest and the most recent
of the latest and the greatest
and the most trending stuff

and if you slay when you
get things done or maybe things
you try to do fall flat or
maybe you slay when you fail
or maybe you do well or maybe
you

don't do what you think about
doing when the best of the
orange juice turns into a horse
the size of a tangerine.

316

I think that everything 
with my blog has been taken 
care of in terms of content 
decency or content restrictions, 
and so I guess I was able to put 
the ads back on my blog. I finally 
finished it. It wasn't that hard or 
anything. I don't know why I didn't 
finish it for several months. The ads 
have been of since March 16th, and it's 
May 16th. There were several posts that 
I had to fix, and I think that I was 
debating between just making minor 
edits to each post, or just making 
entirely new posts.

They went to the store
and they bought a bag
of fruits and with the fruits
they made a bunch of different
drinks depending on what kind
of fruits they had

if they had oranges they
would make orange juice
and if they had grapes
they would make grape juice.

317

and I have to ask if you 
knew who the people were
who changed the fruits into

different kinds of drinks
if they knew that grapes
could become grape juice

and pomegranates could
become
pomegranate juice

did they
know or
did they
not know

318

These are where
the oranges are turned
into the paste 

and the pulp
becomes part of the orange
juice 

and the lemonade 

and
the fruit punch makes
things and drinks that you
can enjoy.

These are the drinks that
are enjoyable to drink.

Project Proposal:				

To create a program that automatically creates
trading tickets for a security, for example, buy 
and sell orders for shares of an exchange traded fund.

A user would only manually enter the first order, either to 
buy or sell a security, the program would populate and submit 
a new ticket based on the fulfillment of the previous ticket, 
the chain of tickets would continue until the user decided to
cancel the chain.

Another application of this program would be to serve as a
treasury management solution.

There's a Little Caesars Pizza close to where I live. 
I went there a few times to get pizza, and I want to 
say that the last two times I went there, nothing was 
Hot-N-Ready, so I would go to the grocery store, or 
7-11, or something, I don't remember exactly; I clearly 
didn't starve to death. Anyway, I went again today, and, 
not wanting to leave empty-handed, I decided to place my 
order through the Little Caesars app first, and then head 
over there, and it worked. There's the option to pay through 
the app, and the option to pay in person, and there is also a 
guest check out, that way I didn't have to set up an account 
or anything. I really wasn't in the mood to set up an account, 
or enter my credit card information into the app or whatever. 
I ordered a nicer pizza that I would ordinarily buy from 
Little Caesars.

321

What Was Originally Here?

I don't remember what was originally here
but whatever it was, I guess it must have been
interesting. There were a lot of pictures and
screenshots of this or that. I don't know what
to do with all of these photographs I'm amassing.

I took of all of the photographs, and saved them.
but I don't know what to do eventually. Where
to put them or post them.

322

Background and the needs:
		
This program is needed because there are many securities
that are difficult to trade because they are illiquid as
a result of large bid and ask spreads, or because they lack 
volume. 

The goal is to reduce spreads while increasing volume.

Another need is due to the fact that manually performing this task
is laborious and prone to error.

323

but i don't really know if i really want to deal with ONEQ. 
There is really a whole lot of bull shit on a lot of these total 
market index funds, and i really don't want to deal with a lot of them. 
stupid. stupid. I know. there's just a lot of shitty ones on the index. 
zombie ticker symbols on the index. some of them never fall off the 
index. well. i don't know. a lot of them are garbage.

I did manage to take care of a few things with my old. With my 401(k). 
and that was kind of nice. I don't know. what else to do. there were a 
few student loan, student aid, and student grant related stuff for school. 
I don't recall. exactly what the deadline is for the application period. 
I want to say that it is.

I guess my day was okay, I did a bunch of 
stuff on the las vegas strip today, but at 
some point i had trouble finding where I parked my car.

326

If there is no overtime this week 
I kind of want to do something. I don't 
know what, but I want to do something. but 
then again. I also kind of don't want to do 
anything. I don't really know. I think about 
things that I want to do. Things that I enjoy 
doing. and sometimes I'm not really sure that 
there are any. I have this idea for a road-trip, 
and it's basically Las Vegas to Carson City to 
Salt Lake City and back.

It's the same distance as the Louisiana Road Trip 
I took back in 2022, and I remember what a disaster 
that turned out to be, but I went on a whole bunch 
since then and they just weren't as much of a disaster, 
so. I'm kind of one-way-or-another. I don't really know.

Question Number One:

Do I really want to go on a long ass drive?

Question Number Two:

Do I really want to stay in bed all weekend?

I just don't have the same kind of stamina and endurance 
I had just a few years ago. I really don't. and I really 
don't want to take any huge risks. at the same time, I'm 
just kind of not in any kind of good mood. I don't know if 
going on a long drive will alleviate that or anything.

Think about how you
on the basis of your 
skills and your mastery
of the nonsense of being
the best of the greatest people
in the entire universe

think about how you
on the edge of the universe
how you
on the fringe of the tablecloth

and waste the best of all your
orange juice reserves

the orange juice
is very special

the orange juice
is also
old
and pale

think about the best of the taste of all
the orange juice and how

each one of your balls
is the size
of a tangerine.

329

is either of your 
testicles
individually 

the size 
of a tangerine?
or is your ballsack
when taken together 
as a whole

a ball sack the size 
of a 
tangerine?

I saw one guy kicking 
the other guy 
in a ballsack the size 
of a tangerine.

is your testicle sack 
the size 
of a

I slept for something like 3 hours and 
I feel fully rechanged. This is really weird. 
Usually I'm dead tired even if I stay asleep 
an hour before I start work, and that's 
usually a hell of a lot of hours of sleep.

333

Trying new things. Well, I want to buy a new 
computer game, but none of the ones I'm looking 
at are games that I'm familiar with, and I'm not 
even really sure that I'll enjoy them. Why or why 
would it not matter? Who knows.

334

I've decided not to go on any kind 
of road trip this week. There isn't 
any overtime, but there are other 
things that I can keep myself occupied 
with for these next few days off.

Well, I guess I spoke too soon, 
there was a short extra shift 
available. So I signed up for it.

335

I was up most of the day. I went to 
get pizza. I played Civilization 6. 
I really only play Civilization 6 as 
Phillip the Second of Spain. I left 
work early yesterday. I capped out on 
Paid Time Off, but for how long? I have 
no idea. I hope I didn't cap out for the 
year. The allocation is about 2 hours per 
week, so it's been about 40 hours I've 
used, and that sounds about right, but 
I'm surprised that I've used it all already.

336

I don't take very many pictures. 
I haven't taken very many pictures 
ever, but I guess I just haven't been 
anywhere new, or, maybe I just haven't 
thought to take any pictures of anything 
I've seen recently. The photo upload 
quality on Blogger is kind of garbage.

337

I left work early twice this week. One day I took VTO, 
and the other day I took PTO. I went to a buffet in 
Chinatown, and I ate only about 2 or 3 plates of food, and then left.

I've been feeling kind of discouraged about how much 
progress I've made paying down my credit cards, 
because I haven't really made any progress paying 
down my credit cards, but then I remembered that it's 
only been two weeks since April, so I've only been at 
it for two weeks.

338

The other day the dogs 
took my athletes foot cream, 
and I think they took it again today.

339

After setting up my phone fully, 
it seems to be working better than 
it had. This new phone seems to work 
better than my previous phone. The 
connection seems to be better than 
it was earlier, so I guess it's not 
that bad, maybe the only issue was 
setting it up.

340

How can a person have athlete's food, and. 
well, sometimes a person develops athelet's balls.
and the balls 
are in a sack 
that's the size 
of a tangerine!

Revision Notes:

D:\GitHub\MIS76810032024Sprg\src\MIS768\edu\\unlv\mis768\kly\individualassignment3\redo\ParcelTerminalDemo.java	

I have a new phone, my old phone cracked and I've gotten 
around to replacing it. I haven't changed service providers. 
It's horrible. I can barely connect my phone to anything. 
The connection is terrible. I don't know what the hell to 
do. Absolutely horrible.

343

A while ago I was donating 
stuff to the thrift store in 
an effort to get rid of anything 
that I didn't really need, or at 
least, get rid of anything I didn't 
think that I would need, and I think 
I donated a set of unopened wood-chisels. 
I didn't really need them because I really 
didn't think that I would take up wood-working 
or anything, and I'm not taking up 
wood-working or anything, but I recently 
came across a use for them, and when I 
looked for them, I couldn't find them, and 
realized that I had donated them a while back. 
I was going to use the wood-chisels to shape the 
tree in the yard. Nothing major, just chip away 
at some of the knobbing that develops when stray 
branches are removed.

I got rid of most of the stray 
branches with a hatchet, a throwing 
axe, and I bashed some of the knobs 
on the tree using a hammer.

This is where the
lucky ones and the
unlucky ones 

eat the oranges and
place the best of the worst

and the pomegranates
are opened up and

you like persimmons but
in my opinion, persimmons really aren't

all that great.

345

I stil don't have the slightest clue what.
That's the thing. I have no idea what I
was searching for. There was something
that I wanted to see if I forgot or not, but
I have no idea what it was or what it is that
I should be looking for.

I put in an order for a new phone,
and
I'm in the process of deleting my OKCupid account.

the issue is that the delete button doesn't work.
and so
I'm not able to delete it.

// formats the color of the text to be green and bold.

347

There's something that I think I 
should take care of, but I have no 
idea what it is. I don't know what 
it is. I'm sure it will come to me later, 
but I have no idea what it is, there's 
just something that I think I'm forgetting 
right now.

// this is the main argument

349

I got rid of a pile of coins, 
loose change, at the grocery store 
earlier today, I think it turned out 
to be about one dollar and fifty cents 
or so. I have work later today. This 
week I signed up for a few extra shifts, 
but there were only half-shifts available, 
and I'm kind of happy about that. I just 
haven't had a ton of energy for full-length 
extra-shifts. Even though, obviously, it's 
better to have a whole shifts pay rather 
than just a half-shifts pay, I'm not too 
sure how much I'm worried about all of that right now.

350

these are a few of the things that I like the best 
and when they are always with the next 
of the best of the worst of the nearest 
and when they come over to the end of the 
chickens feet are cooked in a box.

351

I don't really 
have much to write 
about these days.

I've been meaning to 
re-monetize my blog, 
and I did a little work 
on that, but, there is a 
lot of reviewing and stuff 
that I have to do. Most of 
the time I just erase 
whatever was there before, 
post it somewhere else, 
and then write something 
new where the old post was.

I don't really make a whole lot of 
money blogging, so it's not critically 
important that I re-monetize. The main 
issue is just making everything look 
more professional.

352

These are the things that you are thinking about
when you were sitting on the toilet
and then remembered later when you
were hanging out at the urinal.

you can make thing easier for
yourself or you could potentially
make things more difficult and
listen to what you've been doing.

I want to see things escalate in a way
that is more interesting than the way
they've currently been. I haven't

been very motivated and I think that
things are just more or less useless as
they have ever been.

it's not that my life has been uneventful
because my life is usually uneventful
I just don't really have anything to write
about. everything

seems to be a repetition of things that
have happened before, and documenting
the present is often just a reiteration of

what has happened in the past. things that
are happening now are just things that
have happened before, and are happening
again.

in so many ways i just haven't been 
particularly motivated

in so many ways i've just lost interest
in so many things.

i've been losing motivating
and i've
been losing interest.

I've been experiencing an 
elevated level of stress. 
I don't know what it is. The 
whole time I've been in Las Vegas 
I've been experiencing stress and 
fatigue. I really don't know what's 
causing this. I've tried to make changes 
like drinking more water, and I've noticed 
a slight improvement, but, a very very 
slight improvement. I've been drinking 
slightly less soda, but still quite a bit of it. 
I don't know what else to do.

355

As far as taking any road-trips goes, 
I haven't really planned anything or 
made any definite commitments to go on 
one. I just have that idea of a road-trip 
to Carson City then Salt Lake City and 
then back to Las Vegas.

357

I did a minimal amount of 
working on my blog today. 
I changed a few of the titles 
on the Sanford Street series, 
just a few posts where the 
title was [NUMBER] Sanford Street 
to Letters from Sanford Street # [NUMBER]. I've 
been meaning to do all of them, but it honestly 
really doesn't matter. It doesn't look like ads are 
completely removed from my blog, it just looks like 
they are limited in some way, but it isn't clear to 
me how they are restricted. It's strange that my blog 
is flagged for being adult content because most of this 
is all text. It's not like I have pornographic videos and 
pictures on here.

and then we thought that we would 
see eachother again but we never did 
or at least. it was me who never saw you again.

359

One thing that created a bit of anxiety 
for me was the Chase Checking Account glitch 
where payments were being processed twice.

I actually didn't 
notice the issue at first.

When payday hit, I saw that my 
checking account balance went up, 
but not as much as I expected, 
especially considering how much 
overtime I worked that week. I 
figured that I had a bunch of 
outgoing payments and transfers 
since I usually schedule outgoing 
payments or transfers on a payday, 
and that it was simply due to that, 
and I really didn't look into it any further.

The other reason no alarm bells went off in my 
mind is because the transaction that was 
processed twice was approximately the same 
amount as a few transfers and payments that 
I was sure were going to process around that 
time that I made, so I really just thought 
that it was the payments and transfers that I made.

I was nevertheless stressed out because I started 
to feel that maybe I didn't really plan correctly. 
or something. Anyway, I saw a prompt by Chase about 
the double transaction glitch, and, what do you know, 
it turns out that I was a victim of the Chase Double 
Payment Processing glitch.

when we met 
we said to eachother

My main short term goal is to 
get my credit cards paid off before 
the end of August. This has been my 
goal since the beginning of the year, 
and I think it's a realistic goal. The 
end of August is when my student loan 
repayments start, and I don't want to 
be crushed by student loans and credit 
cards at the same time.

Well, I wonder if someone 
is helping me out here, but, 
who knows. I want to say 
someone is obviously helping 
me out, because something 
kind of funny just happened.

365

I want to write something 
here, but I'm not sure what 
to write, and it's not for a 
lack of things to write, it's 
just that I have no idea what 
I should write about, 
considering the number of 
things that I could write about.

367

I know that it's just cookies, but they don't know that. 
you know. it could have been anything. it could have been 
anything it really could have.

I don't really have very many opportunities 
to write down what's going on, or how things 
have been. There's just other stuff I've been 
doing. I've been playing computer games and 
stuff. tangerine

I have to set aside time to re-monetize my 
blog and get the ads back up, they've been 
taken down due to some obscenity related 
complaints, but I just haven't gotten around 
to remedying the issue.

368

I still have to finish cleaning up 
my blog. There was a signup for overtime 
that came through, but I missed it by two 
hours. This has happened a few times, but, 
I guess it's not as important as it used to 
be. I mean, I guess I don't need the overtime 
money as much as I used to. Well, that's not 
really true. I always need the overtime 
money as long as I have bills to pay.

369

I haven't had a phone break in a while, 
but a few hours ago I dropped my phone 
and the screen cracked. This is a headache.

on my computer

i uploaded all of my
stuff and wiped my drive

I got a minimum amount of 
stuff done during the week. 
I almost want to say I got 
nothing done during the week. 
I don't know. I just didn't get 
much done. I played on the computer. 
I dealt with some money orders that 
I've had sitting around, and I did a 
few things with my investments. Well,
my retirement investments anyway. I don't 
have any non-retirement money right now. I 
have to get started on my taxes, and I have 
to go donate things to the thrift store. 
I'll do that next week. 

375

right now I am very tired and I don't 
think that anything will get any better 
and things will only get more amazing. 
things will turn around for me in a major 
way and things will get better and everything 
will work out and I will thrive and I will do well. 
and I will be happy with myself. and I will be pleased 
by what I accomplished.

376

Something interesting came in the mail today; it was 
marketing mail for business checking accounts from 
Citibank and US Bank, and they were addressed to Chestnut & Hazel. 
I wouldn't mind setting up business checking accounts for Chestnut + Hazel, 
but I really don't have any steady income from Chestnut + Hazel yet.

377

I have to tell you this because
it may be
relevant to
the question

You seek to answer and it may
be what you
need to know
to satiate the
obsessions that

are eating away at your mind and
every thought
you have:
GUESS WHAT! 
BUTTER! IS!
NOT THE!
ANSWER!!!

when there is mail in the mailbox and 
there is new mail in the mailbox and there 
are letters that can be read and there are notices 
from where you are and where you are not. 
and you were happy with what you've done and 
how you did it and where you did it and.

379

I made an effort set up an account to self publish a book. 
It would be the Chestnut Street series. I have to take a 
look at it and see what changes I would make to the text.

It's midnight. I'm hungry, and I don't know where to go to eat.

I went to the Cannery Casino to eat at the Victory Cafe, 
but it wasn't open. Google Maps said it was open 24 Hrs, 
but I guess that wasn't accurate, so I ended up at Bourbon 
Street Bar and Grill. I had wings, but I wasn't too excited 
about them, they just seemed excessively battered, but I was 
really hungry and I'm really not sure what other options I had.

380

These are the things I think
about when I think about 
butter: well, first and foremost
butter is not what makes the
world go round. Something.
some kind of force makes
the world go round, and I 
think that the force in question
would be called momentum,
or maybe it would be called 
inertia, but whatever the force
is called, I doubt that it
is called butter, and therefore!
when people ask what force
makes the world go round
just be aware that butter is 
not the answer to that question!

Sometimes when I go out to eat I get the feeling 
that the food was microwaved after being pulled 
out of a bag from something I could have purchased 
from the frozen food section of the grocery store.

I went and got an oil change, which was something 
I've been meaning to do for a while, and when I was 
getting the oil change, the technician recommended 
that I get my transmission fluid changed, so I did 
that as well. I really don't want to spend more than 
I need to right now, but I know that I've put a hell 
of a lot of miles on my car over the last few months, 
so I need to weigh being cautious with my spending 
against the risks of unexpected car problems from 
skipping on maintenance now.

382

I have to think. I was thinking about pursuing a graduate 
certificate in Spanish Translation at UNLV. One issue is 
that out-of-state tuition would make this cost prohibitive, 
but it's possible that my time in Nevada during 2018 would 
count toward my status as a Nevada resident, this is something 
I have to look into, and I'd probably have to request records 
from the Nevada DMV.

That UTA thing was a total disaster. I'm trying to squeeze 
as much out of the experience as I can by going through the 
course material, but. Yeah, that was a real interesting way 
to flush $3,500 down the toilet.

I need to explore as many programs at as many universities as 
I can. I really would prefer an in-person program rather than 
something remote, or online. I'm still kind of hesitant to look 
at anything. I'm hesitant to pursue a different graduate program 
unless I know that it will be the right fit for me. I don't know 
if there is any possibility of heading back to Texas for one semester, 
and just taking two classes or whatever, but, who knows.

I really want to buy new pants, and 
a new belt, but I also really want to 
hold off on doing either, and yet, 
even though I really want to keep my 
spending as low as possible, I went out 
to eat earlier today and I went out for 
drinks the other day. I went out for 
drinks the other night, and it was supposed 
to be a kind of date, but, we didn't end up 
meeting up. I went to the place she wanted 
to meet up at, but she wasn't there. I waited 
for about an hour, and then went home, and 
like five minutes after I was on my way home, 
she said she was there, and that I should turn 
around and come back.

386

That was discouraging, so I'm going to take a break from online dating. 
This is the second time I deleted, second or maybe third time I've deleted 
a dating profile in the last month. I switched accounts for some of my 
autopay expenses, and I'm kind of just waiting until the switch over becomes active.

Queen of the Goths

she's cute, 
and. 
she's kind of talking to herself, 
and. 
it seems like a very 
engaging conversation,
but 
maybe she's singing,
and
she doesn't have a headset on,
so
she's either singing
from memory
or
talking to herself.

388

what a nightmare. it's night time right now. 
I think that I've been putting 
this together for the past 4 hours or so.

389

I settled the account with UTA. That was a fucking pain in the ass. 
I don't know how many times I've gone over this situation on my blog, 
but I'll go over it again. I was originally awarded 10500 in student 
loans, but after withdrawing from the MSQF program, that amount was 
reduced to about 8500, these are all rough numbers but they're close 
enough, anyway, I was asked to return 2000 dollars to the University, UTA, 
and I just remitted the payment of 2000 bucks a few minutes ago. Headache. 
I really wasn't prepared for this. Anyway. I was really going to put this 
whole ordeal off for a while, but when I looked into my student loan account, 
or the account that services my student loans, I noticed that they adjusted 
the student loan amount from 10500 to 8500, so I figured since the issue that 
I was worried about most has been fixed, then I guess I'm comfortable settling 
the balance with UTA. The issue that I was afraid of was paying twice, so to 
speak, but if the loan servicer adjusted the amount due, then there is no need 
to worry about paying twice, and that's why I figured I'd settle the tab at UTA.

390

One of the issues I'm dealing with right now 
is that I have a balance due on my student 
account at the University of Texas at Arlington. 
This is because I dropped all of my classes and 
withdrew from the MSQF program. My student loan 
allocation for the Fall 2022 semester was reduced 
retroactively, and now I have to pay back one-thousand 
eight-hundred and sixty-five dollars. I was originally 
awarded about ten-thousand in student loans, but that 
award has been reduced retroactively to around eight-thousand 
three-hundred. This is a fucking nightmare.

I'm making quite a few changes to my blog. It is just 
going to be text, mostly. and pictures I'll put somewhere 
else, or I'll create a new page for photographs that I've 
accumulated over time.

391

I went to the gas station 
to get a fountain drink, 
and by the time
I get home, my soda is
gone? Where did it go?
I think I drank it all!

I went to the buffet at the Wynn and even though 
I thought that the buffet was really nice, I don't 
think that I got my money's worth, I just didn't eat 
enough. I went in the morning, around 10 AM, and it 
was really crowded, and then afterward I went driving 
around town looking for something interesting. I tend 
to take this blog in different directions and revise 
things here or there depending on my mood, and as a 
result it's changing constantly, and it keeps changing 
and it will continue to change and I'm not sure how to 
feel about that. things were going well and things were 
all about to go even better but they did not and when I 
think about where everything went they went worse than anything.

392

I'm pretty light now in terms of personal possessions. 
I'm wondering what else is sellable on Facebook Marketplace. 
I kept two hammers that I really like, they're really new, 
and they are both really well made. Well, I think that it's a 
total of three hammers that I kept, one is a jeweler's hammer. 
I'm worried about the next few months. I could potentially have 
a huge tax bill, and I have a limited number of options to reduce 
my tax liabilities before the end of the year. Maybe this is one 
of those years where I just have to eat it.

remember the citrus (2022)

This is where the things 
that you think that you 
remember turn out to be 
memories that you yourself invented

You enjoyed the taste of
the lemonade but really
what you drank was orange 
juice and you think that you
tasted citrus but you really enjoyed 
the taste of oranges and not 
lemons

She told you to drink from the tap
like a man, but you just really weren't 
into that, you really didn't want to drink
from the tap, you are okay drinking from
the fountain you are okay when you drink
fountain drinks but you are not okay
drinking from the tap

Lemonade does not come from
the tap, even when the tap is loaded
with lemonade,

lemonade only comes from the soda
fountain, even though lemonade is not
soda

we can be friends
actually we can't even
be friends 
you're just too fucking weird

you do weird shit and i 
don't want to be associated
with you in 
anyway

These wilted flowers shedding 
petals blissfully in the sad faced sun.

sure it was totally harmless and

There was a minor disappointment the other day. I asked someone 
for a letter of recommendation, and she didn't want to do it. We 
met at some bar in Kentucky back in June, and we chatted, and I 
asked for her phone number and email address, stating that I might 
need a letter of recommendation at some point in the future. I sent 
her a message on LinkedIn the other day, asking for the letter of 
recommendation and she basically isn't familiar enough with me to 
really make any kind of recommendation one way or another. She also 
asked me not to ask her again.

395

I did get a letter showing that my registration for an 
Assumed Name has been recorded with the Tarrant County Clerk. 
The Registration for my copyrights for some of my Letters from 
Sanford Street haven't been dealt with by the U.S. Copyright Office, 
and my Assumed Name registrations haven't been recorded with the 
Secretary of State of Texas, and, other government related bullshit, 
well, the Town of Panama Called me about a speeding ticket that was 
issued several months back, they weren't aggressive or anything, but 
they just told me that I can pay the ticket over the phone, so I did 
that. I tried paying it online, but I received an error message, and 
I wasn't able to pay it online, so I sent the Town of Panama, or maybe 
I sent it to the County of LeFlore, but I sent a letter with screenshots 
of the issue, or a printout of screenshots of the issue.

396

I did something interesting the other day, well, a few things actually, 
I sold additional stuff on Facebook, the previous day I sold a sledgehammer, 
axe, and pickaxe, I'm really not sure why I bought those things, but yesterday 
I sold eight hammers, smaller ones than the ones I sold on Facebook a few days 
before. Another thing that I did that I would say is interesting is that I bought 
US Treasury bonds. Well, US Treasury Bills actually. There are a number of 
different securities that you can buy from the US Treasury, there are savings 
bonds, and those are why I was setting up the TreasuryDirect account, it seems 
that I can only buy US Treasury Savings Bonds through the TreasuryDirect account, 
but anyway, the other day I bought US Treasury Bills through my Fidelity account.

I went to the DMV, and they don't take walk-ins anymore, 
everything is by appointment only, and this works, because 
I set up my appointment already, and it's for next month, and 
I have everything I need, the emissions inspection, my insurance 
has been changed to Nevada, I have documents with my new address 
on it, and, I had the VIN inspection performed. Is there anything 
else that I need to get done? I don't think so. I did set up a 
TreasuryDirect account, or, I mean, I got the process started. It 
isn't as simple as setting up an online account, setting up the online 
account is only part of the process, the other part of the process is 
mailing in another form that needs to be reviewed by your bank. I went 
to Citibank on Aliante Parkway. One of the strange things about the 
Dallas / Fort Work area is that I don't remember any Citibank branches 
in the area.

My schedule for tomorrow, Monday morning, is to 
head to the DMV to get my Driver's License, and 
Vehicle Registration complete, and I was also 
informed that I need a VIN inspection to be performed, 
which is something that I was told while getting my 
Emissions inspection performed. The guy at the Emissions 
inspection place informed me that the number of times a 
vehicle has been registered refers to when a vehicle is 
purchased, and when the vehicles registration is renewed, 
so if a person owns a car for 3 years or whatever, there's 
the original registration, as well as two subsequent renewal 
registrations, which would count for a total of 3 registrations. 
Anyway, after I get that done, there is some paperwork that I 
need taken care of at the bank to open an account with the U.S. 
Treasury to buy savings bonds. I'm not sure how useful setting 
up this account will be, but I think that I'll go ahead and do it.

401

I went to the buffet with my mom earlier, and we just got back. 
The fortune cookie said: Opportunity always knocks at the least 
opportune time, and I thought to myself: that's almost always true, 
but how do I overcome that tendency for things, for opportunities 
to be available when I really can't capitalize on them? and what 
opportunities should I be on the lookout for, and be prepared for?

I'm reading spam messages from one of these bogus dating websites 
I signed up for. It's one of those dating sites where you have to 
pay per message. The obvious thing is that I'm getting tons of 
incoming messages, and I doubt that these women are really paying 
a dollar a message to reach out to my incomplete profile. If they 
were, then I'm making that website a whole bunch of money with my 
incomplete profile.

Valentine's Day in October (2022)

but what
is there
to do now
that you are bored
and what
can you tell me
now that you
have nothing
else to say

and try sending
me a candy bar
and try sending me
a chocolate
bar and
try sending me a greeting
card and try sending
me something romantic
and try sending me something
that I might like
and try sending me
something that might have
meaning to you
and try telling me
something

try telling my something
that I didn't know before
and try saying
something to me
that would

flatter me
and try flattering me
try getting me to
get interested in you

and try getting me to
want to see what
you are having
for a snack
and what fruits are out
of season.

you know what my favorite color is!
and you know what color
your favorite color is
and you know who my favorite person
is and you know who 
your favorite person is!

and this is what I've been wanting
you to say to me this
entire time and you
just haven't come around to
saying it to me.

you really
can't tell me
that everything
is bad right now
because I know
that you're happy

you can't tell me that you
are unhappy because
I know what you like
and I know what 

makes
you 

happy and
I know what pleases
you and I am aware
of your likes and
dislikes.

Some
of the things
that you like are
kind of odd
and
some of the things
you like
are kind of strange
and some of the things
you like are
acquired tastes

and some of the
problems that
you get yourself
into over and
over are things
that you could
refrain from
getting yourself
into.

i had no idea
that someone had
a crush
on you
and i had no idea
someone was somewhat
obsessed
with you and i had
no idea that the feelings
were true and genuine
and i had no idea
that someone would
ever be attracted
to you and i had
no idea that jealousy
was an issue
that you would
have to deal with

she really liked you
and
you didn't realize it
and
you seemed to think
that
everything was not
what
it seemed and you seemed
to
imagine that you were
in 
control when really you
were
something of a puppet

do you like being
back there do you
like being back where
you were and did
you like visiting other
parts of the country
and did you like seeing
places that you've never
seen before and do you
remember what it was
like to be here and do
you think that you'll
ever do that again
and do you think that
you will ever do that

again 

and do you feel
that the rest is more
interesting and do you
think that the rest
of the world is rounder

but I'm not sure if I ran into
you at the Pizza Parlor and
you pointed out to me that the
toppings are beneath the cheese
or if the cheese is placed on top
of the toppings the bartender
asked me to leave and I'm 
really not sure why

i don't know if it's because i missed
you when i most definitely should have
noticed you and 
i don't know if i missed you when
i kind of set myself on a different path
and i don't know what the hell was
going on there
and i don't know if I forgot to
wash my hands before eating
and the
pizza seemed to arrive sooner
than i expected.

she actually really liked
you and it's obvious
that you really cared about
her even though she was
obviously a trouble maker
and she clearly would 
make life difficult for you
if she didn't get what she
wanted from you and now
you are out of college and
now you are lonely and now
you have to start all over again

an update to how things
are going right now. again
it seems I'm being demonetized
for something on my blog. I'm
getting rid of the suspected content
but there really wasn't anything
specific pointed out. and so
I'm going around deleting what
could be offensive.

it was weird. before i left she
came over and asked me to
take her out for dinner, and
i had been wanting to take her
out for dinner for a while. we
went out a few times. i don't 
think that she really liked me.
maybe she did, but i always
felt that she felt that she had
a better option, or that she liked
someone else more. sometimes
i'd be somewhere in the neighborhood
and then BANG she was there too.

we went to dinner. she came over
and asked me to take her out
to dinner, and we got into kind of
an argument when we were there.

and now the Nevada DMV website
is down, it's actually down and the
whole department is actually taking
time off until the issue is resolved.
so, even if I new what documents to
bring to a walk-in, i couldn't even
go if i wanted to because the offices
are closed.

i'm spending additional time cleaning up things here and
it just never seems to end there are so many
dirty things here that are not appropriate for the rules. the
rules
say that this stuff is not
okay
it is not okay to have yourself saying
and writing what you are saying and writing about

i went all the way across
town to go to a buffet called
imperial sushi and seafood.
it was a long drive. the food
was really nice, and, for 36
bucks it was worth the money,
but the drive was a nightmare.
maybe i just haven't ever been 
used to rush hour traffic. I don't
know why.

403

What the hell opportunity should I be on 
the lookout for? I'm thinking that I really 
want as much overtime as I can get these next 
few months, and I really think that overtime 
opportunities are the opportunities that I 
should be looking out for. When I think about 
other opportunities that just didn't happen at the 
right time, graduate school was one of those 
opportunities that just didn't coincide with the 
optimal time period in my life to be going to graduate 
school. I did just get out of the mental health institution, 
and things were just difficult all around. Then there was the 
opportunity to get into the software developer program at Amazon, 
and for some reason there was just always something else that 
popped up, usually just overtime opportunities.

There is something that I found that I might actually be 
interested in using some of the software development skills 
for, I might be interested in using some of my software development 
skills to convert my blog entries into integer sequences that I can 
post on OeisWiki or the OEIS Wiki. I vaguely remember how to do this, 
but it's something like, when the code comes across a certain letter, 
or character, it returns a specific integer, but there were other 
things that I remember that I think I can do, like, I think I'm able 
to turn images into integer sequences.

I'm trying to think. I did look up the subject of DanishCookieUXorious 
while I was clearing out my old bookmarks, and this was interesting 
because I really remember her being blonde, and for a minute I wanted 
to look up that poem I wrote about the bartender on Collins. I could 
have sworn. It happens over and over again. I could have sworn that 
person was blonde.

This free time that I'm having is an opportunity, free time is always 
an opportunity that's. It's the kind of opportunity that I'm unfamiliar 
with capitalizing on. What do I do?

that someone had
a crush
on you
and i had no idea
someone was somewhat
obsessed
with you and i had
no idea that the feelings
were true and genuine
and i had no idea
that someone would
ever be attracted
to you and i had
no idea that jealousy
was an issue
that you would
have to deal with

she really liked you
and
you didn't realize it
and
you seemed to think
that
everything was not
what
it seemed and you seemed
to
imagine that you were
in 
control when really you
were
something of a puppet

do you like being
back there do you
like being back where
you were and did
you like visiting other
parts of the country
and did you like seeing
places that you've never
seen before and do you
remember what it was
like to be here and do
you think that you'll
ever do that again
and do you think that
you will ever do that

again 

and do you feel
that the rest is more
interesting and do you
think that the rest
of the world is rounder

but I'm not sure if I ran into
you at the Pizza Parlor and
you pointed out to me that the
toppings are beneath the cheese
or if the cheese is placed on top
of the toppings the bartender
asked me to leave and I'm 
really not sure why

i don't know if it's because i missed
you when i most definitely should have
noticed you and 
i don't know if i missed you when
i kind of set myself on a different path
and i don't know what the hell was
going on there
and i don't know if I forgot to
wash my hands before eating
and the
pizza seemed to arrive sooner
than i expected.

she actually really liked
you and it's obvious
that you really cared about
her even though she was
obviously a trouble maker
and she clearly would 
make life difficult for you
if she didn't get what she
wanted from you and now
you are out of college and
now you are lonely and now
you have to start all over again

an update to how things
are going right now. again
it seems I'm being demonetized
for something on my blog. I'm
getting rid of the suspected content
but there really wasn't anything
specific pointed out. and so
I'm going around deleting what
could be offensive.

it was weird. before i left she
came over and asked me to
take her out for dinner, and
i had been wanting to take her
out for dinner for a while. we
went out a few times. i don't 
think that she really liked me.
maybe she did, but i always
felt that she felt that she had
a better option, or that she liked
someone else more. sometimes
i'd be somewhere in the neighborhood
and then BANG she was there too.

we went to dinner. she came over
and asked me to take her out
to dinner, and we got into kind of
an argument when we were there.

and now the Nevada DMV website
is down, it's actually down and the
whole department is actually taking
time off until the issue is resolved.
so, even if I new what documents to
bring to a walk-in, i couldn't even
go if i wanted to because the offices
are closed.

i'm spending additional time cleaning up things here and
it just never seems to end there are so many
dirty things here that are not appropriate for the rules. the
rules
say that this stuff is not
okay
it is not okay to have yourself saying
and writing what you are saying and writing about

i went all the way across
town to go to a buffet called
imperial sushi and seafood.
it was a long drive. the food
was really nice, and, for 36
bucks it was worth the money,
but the drive was a nightmare.
maybe i just haven't ever been 
used to rush hour traffic. I don't
know why.

405

I think that I have everything I need to get set 
up with a driver's license and vehicle registration 
in Nevada. I needed statements from a bank or credit 
card, and I have that now, I had to print them up, so 
I went to the UPS store, but they wanted quite a bit 
of money to print them. Like five bucks, so I went to 
the library instead. It was still more than I wanted 
to pay, but it was two dollars total, one to renew my 
library card, and another dollar to print the documents 
I needed.

I feel funny, that I pinch pennies with certain things, 
but I spend money on some of my bad habits. I got a letter 
from Coppell, Texas. It wasn't anything Texas related. 
Strange. I don't know what was going on those last few months 
in Texas, but I swear, everything was spiraling down the 
shitter. It really was. Everything was really spiraling 
down the shitter. Nearly everyone I came across, or, 95 
percent, seemed to be in a mood to start some kind of an argument.

406

what could I be doing right now? i can't really 
think of anything, and I don't really want to rush 
into anything. I have time, and I should be using 
it for something, but what?

407

I have most of everything that I need to complete 
my change of residence from Texas to Nevada, and 
to request a Nevada Driver's License and to register 
my vehicle in Nevada. The main thing that helped me 
was an account that I set up with Bank of America 
on a whim, just a savings account. Like I said, I 
set it up on a whim, and I'm not sure why I set 
it up, but the statement cycle just finished, most 
of my other accounts have statement cycles that 
would end later in the month, and so, if I were 
to have waited for any of the other accounts 
to issue a new statement with my updated address, 
it would probably be another week. The issue that 
I'm having, right now, however, is that the Nevada 
DMV website is not working. It's down or something. 
It's not loading.

408

that was a garbage kind of a thing a 
kind of disaster kind of a nightmare 
a kind of worst than anything a kind of 
thing that didn't go well a kind of horse 
that cannot be ridden. a kind of donkey.

409

What was the first issue that I was facing when 
it came to graduate school? Group work, and group 
projects. I just really hate doing them, and they're 
rarely ever a collaborative effort. Most of the time 
there's this dynamic of establishing a pecking order. 
I don't want to make a contribution if I'm just going 
to be discredited for any work that I do. In this case, 
the person that I was originally assigned to work with. 
She was positioning herself in a way where, I would basically 
work on something, and I would have to run it by her first, 
and she would either say yes or no on it, and I thought that 
was shitty, like, fuck that, why doesn't she just do all the 
work, and I have the final say on it.

410

This was back from UTA. 
I still really do not 
like doing group work.

There was a group project for MIS 764
and. well. there is a group project for MIS 764 
and you know. it's something that's going on right now.
but I still really wish that I could be working 
independently.

Valentine's Day in October (2022)

but what
is there
to do now
that you are bored
and what
can you tell me
now that you
have nothing
else to say

and try sending
me a candy bar
and try sending me
a chocolate
bar and
try sending me a greeting
card and try sending
me something romantic
and try sending me something
that I might like
and try sending me
something that might have
meaning to you
and try telling me
something

try telling my something
that I didn't know before
and try saying
something to me
that would

flatter me
and try flattering me
try getting me to
get interested in you

and try getting me to
want to see what
you are having
for a snack
and what fruits are out
of season.

you know what my favorite color is!
and you know what color
your favorite color is
and you know who my favorite person
is and you know who 
your favorite person is!

and this is what I've been wanting
you to say to me this
entire time and you
just haven't come around to
saying it to me.

you really
can't tell me
that everything
is bad right now
because I know
that you're happy

you can't tell me that you
are unhappy because
I know what you like
and I know what 

makes
you 

happy and
I know what pleases
you and I am aware
of your likes and
dislikes.

Some
of the things
that you like are
kind of odd
and
some of the things
you like
are kind of strange
and some of the things
you like are
acquired tastes

and some of the
problems that
you get yourself
into over and
over are things
that you could
refrain from
getting yourself
into.

I should probably just forget about graduate 
school altogether. I don't want to be in a 
position where, the only thing I do is spend 
all of my time working for someone else, or 
doing someone else's work, pay tuition and 
shit for doing so, and in the process get 
discredited for any work that I do.

413

These things have not been here 
the whole time, and they have 
not been the best of the best, and 
they have not been the sticks of the butter.

She asked me to send a photograph
of me, stroking a stick of butter, and
I had to tell the girl that it wasn't
really what she was after, and she
really did not want me to send her
a photograph
of me stroking a stick of butter.

What she really wanted was a video
of me making a duck bill with my hand
and sticking my duck bill hand into
a bowl of butter, sticks of butter
are not the answer!

Places that I think about. 
I might not see them again, 
but places that I've been to, 
that I might not see again, that 
I think about. Gallup, New Mexico, 
Somerville, Tennessee, and 
La Vergne, Tennessee.

and while some people wish upon a 
star, it's totally possible that I would
have to wish upon a stick of butter
and tell people that the butter, that
praying to a stick of butter, that
wishing upon a stick of butter is 
not the solution to the
it's not the solution to whatever issue
you are having.

414

I bought a carton of eggnog and drank it all. 
I'm kind of just hanging out in my car and I'm 
probably going to go back in and get something else. 
There's nothing to do at home, but I'm not bored to the 
point that I really want to go prowl the streets. I think 
that I've taken care of most of the stuff, the preliminary 
stuff related to relocating, I have to change my addresses 
in my accounts first, then once I have statements, then I 
can go to the Nevada DMV to request a Nevada Driver's 
License, and then I can request Nevada Vehicle Registration.

415

Yeah, I really don't know what to do. 
I don't have any specific plans for the 
future, and maybe I should just leave it 
that way. Maybe I should just go with the 
flow until something comes up, or an 
opportunity comes up. 

These are basically the things I need in Life to Eat the
butter, but I already established that 
Butter is not the answer, and
yet you did not listen to me.

Stay where the people are rather than
going to that place where the invisible
people are. That's where the nest is and
where the birds go.

416

Yeah, I really don't know what to do. I don't have 
any specific plans for the future, and maybe I should 
just leave it that way. Maybe I should just go with the 
flow until something comes up, or an opportunity comes up.

417

Well, I guess I can think of today as the 
date that I've moved to Las Vegas. Today is October 8th, 2022

from the Chestnut + Hazel archive, and I honestly found it very funny, but, also very sad and depressing as well. I don't know what I was thinking about when I wrote this poem. I really don't. I really think that it's funny. Right now I'm working on just cleaning up my blog and that's pretty much it.

Porn Videos

I'm thinking about creating a new genre of adult films.
Basically they will involve normeenas and gorblanas
engaging in shorblanification of their adamantios moogies.

It will be so nasty, that search engines will not run ads
involving normeenas and gorblanas doing anything at
all, even regular stuff like fishing and flying kites because

The association that people will have with normeenas and
gorblanas will be inherently pornographic, and the acts that
they engage in will be so disgusting that there will even be

Congressional hearings, all on C-Span, discussing the prospect
of regulating the acts that normeenas and gorblanas engage
in. Senators will run on platforms to regulate the normeenas

and gorblanas. Judges will be appointed who are strictly
opposed to sexual relationships between normeenas and
gorlanas. Anti-miscegenation legislation will be on the dockets

of every legislative body to restrict how normeenas and
gorblanas interact. Adoption agencies will be prohibited
from facilitating the adoption of progeny from these unions.

No one will be able to adopt a normeena-gorblana child.
Normeena-gorblana children who are not adopted will grow
up on the streets, selling teleomarkinites and shamdoobies

to make ends meet. They will steal mammyonography from
the adult bookshops and resell them at the swap meet and
flea market and on amazon and ebay and craigslist and letgo.

The normeena-gorblana rights commission will fight the 
oppression of the people, but the commission's funding will
come primarily from the adult film industry, and they will

not be taken seriously, or they will be seen as perpetuation
the perversions of the normeena-gorblana fetishists. A new
political party will emerge to protect the normeenas, and a

separate party will emerge to protect the gorblanas, and new
adult films will feature dirty talk between the two parties and
hardcore magazine will be sold, but buyers will need a permit

from the decency agency in order to buy them. A test will be
administered to see whether or not a person qualifies, only the
most sane and normal people will be allowed to but these books.

430

It's hot, and I'm fucking tired. 
I went out to eat, just fish and 
chips like I usually eat when I go 
out to eat. What the hell was I 
thinking about? I have to drop off 
my mail at the post office.

431

there was a woman at the post office 
and she said to me 
she asked me if 

i knew how to lick stamps.
if i was good.
at 
licking stamps?

how would I know that?
how would I know if I'm good at licking  
stamps?

What the hell do I have to do right now?

I'm glad the weekend is 
just a few hours away. 
it's hot.

the world burns the world 
the atmosphere is starting 
to turn into a kind of oven 
and we will all be cooked!

436

It was fried and that is just 
the way it is when things are cooked 
they are turned into food and have they 
been cooked or not have they 
been turned into a kind of food or have 
they not been cooked?

437

I think about times in my life where 
I'm going through the kinds of things I'm 
going through right now. I don't know how to 
describe how it's different this time, but it 
is different. It's different because things are 
confusing; I'm confused about how to deal with; 
I'm confused about how to move forward, and I'm 
confused about what to do next, but things aren't 
really all that bleak right now, things really aren't 
all that hopeless. Things are just confusing. I just 
really don't know what to do next.

438

maybe there is something else out there 
for you. something that you can do 
you are too dumb for this!

do you really think

440

no, i do not think you are too 
dumb for this.

441

I think that I'm just going to operate 
under the assumption that Nevada is where 
I'm going to be for now, and I'll just go 
through with getting a Nevada Driver's 
License, and Nevada Plates.

fabio was 
at the grocery store
his hair flowing
and his tits were
perkier than ever
he reached for a
stick of land o' lakes
and i told him
straight up
fabio
butter
is not the answer
and he said to me
a suave as ever
that he couldn't believe 
that butter is not the answer.

443

I keep coming across this 
poem called valentines day in october.

444

fabio was 
at the grocery store
his hair flowing
and his tits were
perkier than ever
he reached for a
stick of land o' lakes
and i told him
straight up
fabio
butter
is not the answer
and he said to me
a suave as ever
that he couldn't believe 
that butter is not the answer.

445

i did get back on the dating
apps today
and i'm actually not even telling
the truth in this case
but i've already had tons of
flirtation bots 
hitting me up
believe me
i know what this
woman is up to
she's the kind of woman
who puts butter on
her pancakes
but a woman who
puts butter on her
pancakes is not the
answer
and butter
is still never the
fucking answer.

446

is there anything 
else you would 
like to tell me?

447

no, you will find out 
the hard way!

448

what do you mean by that?

449

you can search the whole world
for the fucking answer
but
butter
is not the fucking answer.

there are so many questions in life,
and one of those
questions might be
whether or not
butter is the answer.
butter is not the answer.

450

You can see what the
majority of us see and 
you can tell me what you
are looking for, but most 
of the things that we are 
looking for are irrelevant to
the objective we are
trying to accomplish,
and these are not what
the people want, and these
are not what the people
are thinking of.

451

what people really want
and what people are really 
thinking about
is that butter. is. the answer to
all of the problems of
the human condition,
but really,
butter,
is never the answer.

452

I don't want you 
to tell anyone
this because it gives 
us a competitive advantage
over the competition, and we
want to have an advantage 
over the competition
because they
are incompetent, and do

not deserve to defeat us
in this highly competitive
environment.
Well? What it
it that I want to tell you
that I don't want 
the competition
to be aware of?
It's this, and this alone:
BUTTER IS NOT THE ANSWER!

453

I'm thinking. I have no idea 
what I should be doing right now.

454

but what
is there
to do now
that you are bored
and what
can you tell me
now that you
have nothing
else to say

455

and try sending
me a candy bar
and try sending me
a chocolate
bar and
try sending me a greeting
card and try sending
me something romantic
and try sending me something
that I might like
and try sending me
something that might have
meaning to you
and try telling me
something

456

try telling my something
that I didn't know before
and try saying
something to me
that would

457

flatter me
and try flattering me
try getting me to
get interested in you

and try getting me to
want to see what
you are having
for a snack
and what fruits are out
of season.

458

you know what my favorite color is!
and you know what color
your favorite color is
and you know who my favorite person
is and you know who 
your favorite person is!

and this is what I've been wanting
you to say to me this
entire time and you
just haven't come around to
saying it to me.

459

you really
can't tell me
that everything
is bad right now
because I know
that you're happy

you can't tell me that you
are unhappy because
I know what you like
and I know what 

makes
you 

happy and
I know what pleases
you and I am aware
of your likes and
dislikes.

460

Some
of the things
that you like are
kind of odd
and
some of the things
you like
are kind of strange
and some of the things
you like are
acquired tastes

and some of the
problems that
you get yourself
into over and
over are things
that you could
refrain from
getting yourself
into.

461

i had no idea
that someone had
a crush
on you
and i had no idea
someone was somewhat
obsessed
with you and i had
no idea that the feelings
were true and genuine
and i had no idea
that someone would
ever be attracted
to you and i had
no idea that jealousy
was an issue
that you would
have to deal with

she really liked you
and
you didn't realize it
and
you seemed to think
that
everything was not
what
it seemed and you seemed
to
imagine that you were
in 
control when really you
were
something of a puppet

462

do you like being
back there do you
like being back where
you were and did
you like visiting other
parts of the country
and did you like seeing
places that you've never
seen before and do you
remember what it was
like to be here and do
you think that you'll
ever do that again
and do you think that
you will ever do that

again 

and do you feel
that the rest is more
interesting and do you
think that the rest
of the world is rounder

but I'm not sure if I ran into
you at the Pizza Parlor and
you pointed out to me that the
toppings are beneath the cheese
or if the cheese is placed on top
of the toppings the bartender
asked me to leave and I'm 
really not sure why

i don't know if it's because i missed
you when i most definitely should have
noticed you and 
i don't know if i missed you when
i kind of set myself on a different path
and i don't know what the hell was
going on there
and i don't know if I forgot to
wash my hands before eating
and the
pizza seemed to arrive sooner
than i expected.

I just applied for a position here in Las Vegas, and, 
I'll continue to look for work. I don't think that I'll 
be heading back to Arlington, it just seems like it's really 
not going to happen. I'm putting a few other things on the 
back burner for now. Like continuing to work on Chestnut + Hazel, 
more specifically, business registration aspects of it. I tried 
looking for positions at Amazon, but there was nothing available 
in the area. I was thinking that, since it's somewhat easy to 
transfer between locations with Amazon, that maybe I'd get in 
at a location here, and then, if something were to bring me back 
to Dallas / Fort Worth, that maybe I'd transfer back there. There's 
just nothing really in Dallas / Fort Worth, though, other than college, 
and even that was kind of falling apart. 

I did file a copyright for a few of my posts from the Letters from 
Sanford Street series, I used the "Online Literary Works" form, and 
it was somewhat more involved than using the Standard Registration 
process, but it does allow me to have claims on each individual post, 
rather than having a single claim one gigantic series. In this specific 
case, even though there is a single application for the 14 posts that 
I registered, each post is registered as part of a larger registration, 
using the previous method that I used, I would have to compile all the 
posts into a single post, and then register that single post as 
a "Collective Work" that I'd have a claim on. 

This distinction probably 
isn't obvious to someone who doesn't 
register copyrights, but an analogy 
that might make this easier to understand, 
is that it's like having 14 
different deeds to 14 different 1 acre plots of 
land, rather than having 
1 deed to a single 14 acre plot of land.

465

another issue when registering copyright
that I'm kind of coming into right now is 
the issue of a work that has multiple authors.

I want to register some of the things that I worked
on for MIS 764, but, technically everything was a group 
assignment, so technically everything has three authors.
and technically, everything has three owners, since I think 
in this case authorship and ownership would be the same.

similar to the analogy above, if a 10 acre plot of land has 
three owners, each owner has a 33.3% interest in that 10 acre 
plot of land, they don't have 3.33 acres each.

466

I also set up a mailbox at the UPS Store for my business, 
Chestnut + Hazel, and, even though I'm putting off registering 
the business in Clark County for the time being, I'm sure that 
I'll come around to it at some point.

467

What I'm I dealing with right now? 
I tried withdrawing from the MSQF 
program at UTA, but it's not as simple 
as clicking a button and withdrawing, 
and dropping out, if it was that easy, 
that's probably what I would have done; 
on the one hand, I don't really want to 
drop out, and on the other hand, I don't 
really see myself going back to the 
Dallas / Fort Worth area.

468

I really don't see myself ever going back to the 
Dallas/ Fort Worth area, but it's possible that one circumstance 
or another might lead me right back there. It was one circumstance 
or another that brought me to the Dallas / Fort Worth area in the 
first place, maybe one circumstance or another might bring me back 
there, but I really don't see that happening.

469

Who knows what could happen between now and December? 
Anything in the universe could happen between now and December, 
and so it might make sense for me to keep my options open, and 
that's kind of why I'm seeking "incompletes" for my courses, 
rather than withdrawing from the courses completely and 
dropping out of the MSQF program. 

While I'm here in Las Vegas I should probably find 
work. One of the issues about finding work here in 
Las Vegas is that once I start looking for work and 
once I start really setting myself up here in Las Vegas, 
it becomes less and less likely that I'll return to 
Dallas / Fort Worth. I didn't really have anything 
going on for me, other than graduate school, that was 
really keeping me in Dallas / Fort Work, and I was 
facing a number of issues in addition to not really 
being able to get anything done in terms of course 
work and in terms of studying, I had a number of 
problems going on that I really would rather not mention.

It feels strange being back in Las Vegas, 
passing by the city skyline it just seems small 
in comparison to the DFW area. I really only saw 
the Dallas skyline a hand full of times, a few 
times when I moved to Dallas in 2020, and then, 
usually each time I left the area on a road trip. 
I feel funny. This feels really weird. Being back here. 
It feels different, it feels really different this time. 
Being here. Well, guess what is on my mind? it isn't 
popcorn, and it isn't corn on the cob! the only thing 
that I'm thinking about right now is how butter is simply 
not the answer.

When I think about it, I wonder what it would have been like to stay in Gallup, New Mexico, 
if I would have started a life out there. It wouldn't have been clear to me what I would 
have done for work, or if there really was any work out there for me to do. I'm still so 
unsure about this whole thing about being back in Nevada.

66 miles outside of Las Vegas. I'm at a gas station just unwinding for a little bit. Hum
back in Arizona I stopped at a Napa Auto Parts store and changed my wiper blades.
I'm about 160 miles outside of Las Vegas. I emailed my graduate advisor about my situation,

I stayed in Gallup, New Mexico for just one

I really think that I liked her. I really would 
have considered staying in Gallup, New Mexico, still. 
I'm not sure what I would have done for work, or where 
I would have stayed or, whatever. There was something 
interesting at the hotel I stayed at. The hotel was 
actually somewhat fancy, and some of the other hotels 
in the area, the ones that seemed abandoned, or worn 
down, or otherwise kind of lousy, were the ones I really 
wanted to stay at. I wanted to stay at a cheaper motel, 
or cheaper hotel or something that was cheap, and also 
looked cheap. The desk agent was actually a person who was telecommuting.

I'm leaving Texas and heading back to Las Vegas. I'm taking the time to sit down and write something. 
I remember 
coming down here. I mean, to Texas, years ago when I first moved here, and I almost headed back to 
Las Vegas 
after the first few nights here. I remember just driving around the state for a while, and then 
staying in 
the DFW area, and then tried to head to Vegas, but for some reason I ended up staying here. 

I completed 
the dba stuff at the UPS store when I got back here, it's the same place I set up an address at when 
I first 
came to Texas. Well, there are two separate governing bodies that dba registration have to be filed 
with, Tarrant 
County, and the Texas Secretary of State, I did the registration with the Secretary of State when I 
was 
in Little Rock, Arkansas because it didn't require being notarized by a notary in Tarrant County.

I head all the way back to Tarrant County, 
and then I head to Vegas. I feel like my life 
is nothing but a series of going in one 
fucking direction, and then back-tracking. 
Let's just figure out this dba bullshit first.

i have 2 
fucking days.

I have to head all the way back to 
Tarrant County, and then figure out 
where to go from there. I mean. I 
guess I'll head over to Vegas. I mean, 
I have to figure out the whole school 
thing, and I really think it might be 
easier to just go to UTA, and somehow, 
you know, express the extraordinary 
challenges that I've faced these last few weeks.

butter is something that comes from a cow 
when you squeeze the cow in a very specific 
way and when you have an olive and you squeeze 
the olive in a very specific way you get olive oil 
and when you find yourself eating breadsticks and you 
find youself asking if the breadsticks were coated 
in butter, it is possible that butter is not the answer.

probably what I would have done; on the one hand, I don't really 
want to drop out, and on the other hand, I don't really see myself 
going back to the Dallas / Fort Worth area.

504

there were things 
that I discovered 
out there in the wilderness.
and there were things 
that I saw that I 
didn't want to see.

things that were there were 
things that were always new 
and were things that were doable and 
we cannot have a meeting because 
you are not available to meet with me 
during a time that would work 
for us both but when there 
are times that work for 
you there are times 
that may or may not work
for me.

one thing that I often face that 
impedes my ability to get anything 
done is the avalanche of emails that 
I have to deal with, or that fall into 
my mail box. I obviously don't read them 
all, but I usually scan them to see if they 
contain anything important. or are just useless.

509

most of the time they are just useless 
and they just ask me millions 
of various questions.

510

you are not allowed 
to be a mean person.

Thinking. I'm going to hold off on 
looking for work right 
now. or looking 
for an internship or anything like that.

I really should just be

512

there were a bunch of things that I 
saw the other day that really scared me.

there was an orange on the table 
and there was a man squeezing the orange 
and putting all the juice inside 
of a cup.

i dont know what happened the other day. 
but i seemed to have irritated the 
bartender at this pizza place i went to. 
I really didn't understand what happened.

she seemed upset about something. she said that she wanted me to leave. so i paid and left.
a guy chased after me, and said: "No one here thinks that's funny."
and i still have no idea what i did, or what offense i committed.

i remember, i asked where the basil was, and a woman behind me said:
"the toppings are placed underneath the cheese here."
and i responded: "you're right about that, i've eaten here before."

and then i just sort of went at it with my pizza,
and then the bartender became upset.
my nails were dirty, really dirty, and i was eating two slices of pizza at a time. like a pig.
and maybe that was the thing, she was irritated that i was eating like a pig.

but.
i think that i was eating with a fork and knife first, and then
i started eating with my hands.
maybe i should just change my major or something.
i really fucking wanted to go to school, but, i don't really know what the hell to do.

516

there was something 
funny at a restaurant the 
other day. I ate 
tacos with chorizo as meat 
for the first time ever and the 
guy asked me 

what do you 
normally eat chorizo with
or he asked 
how do you normally eat chorizo 

and i said that I normally eat 
chorizo with rice. 
i really do.

I try to buy stamps, twenty is too much for
one stamp, and she can't break bills, and
I can't have them all, I ask to trade stamps,
one for one, she's not sure that's okay,
so she phones a friend. she asks
if I have exact change and I say:
yes! I do.

520

I would later tell her that I need 
way more than stamps.
way more than just stamps I need 
way more than what you have to send
letters with.

i told her that i needed it all 
that I needed everything. 
i need it all I need everything.

but she didn't hear me she was already in 
the other neighborhood and she was delivering 
parcels and letters and she 
couldn't hear me because i was really just talking 
to myself.

One of the companies that I looked at for 
internships has internships that I'm interested 
in, but it also has open positions that I'm 
interested in and that I think I'd be a good 
fit for. Several years ago I was considered a 
strong candidate for and received an offer for 
a position at a similar company when I was in 
Missouri, but I didn't take it, and the decision 
for not taking it is kind of complex.

to make friends, or catch up 
with family, or shoot the shit 
with random strangers. There's 
really just too much shit to do. 
There's really just too much fucking 
shit to do. People get made if you don't 
waste time, but there really isn't a 
hell of a lot of time to waste. Why 
don't we watch TV all day? Why don't 
we play computer games all day? Why 
don't we chat about politics and 
all this other shit? All fucking 
day? Well, for one thing: I have 
all kind of other shit that I need 
to do all fucking day. and if I'm

here is where the wild things get wilder where 
they are stranger than they were where 
they get to be the best of all things.
and how they are nicer than they would have been.
Okay, so I fixed part of the problem

I haven't had a lot of time to do 
anything lately. maybe. maybe this 
is my opportunity to do something different.

608

I remember something funny. I remember, when 
I was working at Amazon, I applied for a position 
that one of the managers though I was underqualified 
for, so he gave me a hard time about it. I went to. 
I guess. The manager of all the managers at the site, 
and tried to clarify that I was just kind of. I guess. 
Trying to amuse myself by applying for one of the most 
awesome positions in the company that I could think of, 
and that I usually do this sort of thing when I'm unemployed, 
but I haven't been unemployed for the longest time, so I 
figured I would just do it anyway.

609

I didn't know that there was an election 
on 05/07/2022. I was asleep, and I didn't 
find out about it until the day after.

610

So. What am I going to do?

I'm going to file for unemployment. 
I doubt that I will have my claim approved, 
but it's. I think that it's important to file 
for unemployment, considering that I'm unemployed, 
um, because I think it's important to be part of 
the headcount of people who are not working, but 
looking for work. This is a nightmare, because, 
it feels like it just adds hassle to my day. I 
think of filing unemployment as similar to 
participating in the census. I guess. Maybe, 
filing for unemployment is kind of a waste of time, 
considering that I'm unlikely to get benefits, but, 
the maybe the same could be said about the census.

611

When it comes to dating. it seems 
that there is a kind of testing 
stage, with a subsequent authentication stage.

612

I don't know what to do. 
as far as work goes. I really don't.

orange juice was made with
all of the best sauces and all of the best
things that were all of the best 
things and all of the best fruits and 
all of the best things that were 
all of the best waters.

Do you have a minimum of two (2) when you told them.
I don't I really don't have what you need.
years of e-Commerce Global Data Synchronization 
when you ask me a question do not already be ready
Network or similar product do not tell me how these 
are the worst things that you can think of how these are the best 
things that you can do that these are the test that these are the 
limits of the toast. content platform experience in a private, 
public, government or military environment?
can you? eat everything that there was when you did.

613

Gibberish. pure gibberish is the answer 
to your question and it is how I will deal 
with this question that you are answering to me that you are telling
me that you are asking me that you were wondering about.

614

So today is my first day of 
the work search. I applied for 
the position ANLY DIGITAL ASSET 
PRODUCTION at 3M. do you want to be
where you are and how you have been doing it. 

and true that I don't have the qualifications 
that you are looking for but what's so amazing 
about really great qualifications.

615

I'm sure that I have the qualifications 
for this role, in fact, I'm sure that 
I can add more value to the company in 
this role than 15 asteroids of pure gold.

anyway.
I have to think.
I kind of like looking for work. 
I kind of like work prospecting.

I have to start looking for work.
What are my thoughts? Well, I put in my 
resignation at Amazon. My figuring is that: 
the company will probably return staffing 
levels, or head-counts, to pre-pandemic levels, 
like the newspaper says, so, in a way I'm saving 
someone else's position in the process. I think 
that if I hadn't resigned, I probably would have 
continued exploring the company.

616

I haven't been on a job hunt in a while.
Tired. Quite. Tired. I remember reading a while ago.
Never mind.
I'm fucking tired. I tried to 
delete my Plenty of Fish account, 
but it doesn't appear to be a possibility.

617

I left work about an hour and a half early.
I might be stuck in town.
I thought about. Someone. the other 
day. during one of these restless 
nights. and I just couldn't sleep.
I filed a copyright for my #putinpullout! series on Twitter

I wonder where the hell this came 
from and how it ended up in my current document.

Spam Stanzas

619

Asian beauties, Russian Beauties, and pills
   to enlarge your penis, a lottery
   check is waiting for you, and unpaid bills,
   and deals on ancient Chinese pottery.

A handful of rice and a slice of spam
   and a sheet of nori: wrap it around
   and you have spam musubi, then you cram
   it into your throat and swallow it down.

Spam is something that en masse you delete
   because everything caught by the filter
   is useless. Spam is something that you eat
   unless your stomach feels out of kilter.

Spam is a nuisance, and also a food
one is deleted, the other is stewed.

Every day there's a new barrage of text
   messages queued inside my SMS
   box telling me of all the greatest shit
that I need to know: Tesla's not indexed
   to the S&P 500, new sets
   of rockets where shot into space with kits

of Chinese terrariums filled with plants
   in an attempt to colonize the moon:
rice so good that caterpillars and ants
   have reallocated all their doubloons into

a new space rice rocket landing mobile
   and lunar rice paddy REIT's, while roaches 
   have a position on rice terraces
on Martian mountains and hope to double
   rice shipments with interstellar coaches
   powered by Lockheed and L3 Harris.

621

And then there are notifications from 
the webcam ladies on Pornhub asking
for another round of seed funding, some
kind of boob photograph monetizing

algorithm that basically turns boob
photographs into cryptocurrency
called titty coins that every single N00B
playing Call of Boobies can use to see

the exact location of the knocker
exposure device, which will debrassier
all the dudes and chicks with great boobs faster
than a mechanical hand. Yet, we fear

a high degree of illiquidity
for any cryptocoin based on titties.

622

The calls that come in from some random chick
from some far away place where call centers
dot the landscape and everyone is sick
from the COVID lockdown that our betters

have forced upon us. She keeps asking me
for donations for the starving lions
of the Kalahari Jungle, and pleads
for donations in cryptocoins, tying

the success of her crypto nonprofit
to the results of the latest death stats
issued by the local health department

my GMAT book arrived.

624

it turns out that I never 
retook the GMAT again. never.
I never got around to it. I never

I wonder what would have happened if I 
retook the GMAT.

   Fuck You! and pay me you dumb fucking mink!

632

I thoguht that you 
were resting but you 
were not resting and you were 
not sleeping or anything like that.
and you were doing all the things that 
were the worse of both world that were
the best of every world.

and tell me how you 
came to the conclusion that the best of all these are
not the best of everyone.

633

Countless messages from random ladies 
   on Instagram, most of them telling me
   how naughty their webcam streams on OnlyFans
are, the best positions and poses, these
   days, with modern cosmetic surgery,
   all the chicks are hella fine, pale or tan,

it doesn't matter, spray one on, or bleach 
   one off, there are coupons in your spam box
that you can economize with, and each
  tanning solon has TikTok whores galore,
     each and every one a big titty fox
  that I really want to make nice and sore.

I don't need tanning, I'm already bronze,
except for my Johnson and his bon-bons.

634

There were a few things 
that I was looking for.

635

What am I working on.
Yeah. I think that I'm done with the #putinpullout! series
especially considering that
i filed a copyright for it.
a best of all worlds.

636

and I don't want to 
work on it right now.

637

Is it true?
You are the aribol for the shorganda leebo?
no
I am not the shorganda Leebo? or the aribol for
the shorganda leebo, please do not
ask me that again, because

yesterday i was naked 
and I ate an entire bowl of the
frutiest peebbles in the
jornebromarri tola

638

here we go again. I told 
you over a thousand times
not to eat my punani, and yet 
you ate it anyway!

639

What. exactly. is  a  queef
and bean burrito?

well, it's kind of a dual fart. where
one fart exits the front door, and another
fart exits the rear door.

when i was in moscow the other 
mellenium. i went to st petersberg
square, and there
at the center of the square

was vladimeer purtin!

640

but the best of how
things go wrong 
is where it all goes crazy 
I figured it out. Figure out .
Think about what you wanny. 
Think about what you want. 
And that's what youll get.
Okay
Go take a nap!
Happy mother's day mom. I've been busy, so, I'm writing this a few days ahead.
Try to understand that I have time to do this now, and, I might have to work, 
at somepoint, in the future. So.
Alright mom. Since you won't stop nagging. I faked my death. I'm still alive. 
I didn't die on August 15th, 1987. I'm writing this to you on May 6th, 2022. 

641

Why did I fake my death? What was 
I supposed to do? Let you nag me to 
death? That kind of environment would 
have killed me. I probably would have 
died as a result.

I'm still having nightmares
I cant sleep.
This is a nightmare. A real nightmare.

Should.
how were they and how were 
things going? when they were good and when 
they got better.
What should I do?

Kenneth.
Thats just the air conditioner.
It's not the aliens!

Dont worry!

642

I cant sleep.
This is what I imagine
him saying is:
Lets play a game
Where i lose once,
And you lose once.

You don't need to go to the hospital. This isn't a real problem.
Okay, it really isn't.
You just need a guidance consuler.

you are very rotten. I wouldn't.
I would not do that.

Some ideas for a working title?

These are a few of my idea. right now. i'm really tired..
my idea. don't worry too much about the imperfections
in your writing, like. let it come out however it comes it
and let someone else fight over the meaning, and
create.

let someone else edit it,

get some rest. write about it.

you will enjoy it. 
writing. don't worry too much about all
that other stuff you are worrying about.

so here was the experience I had tonight. 
i realized, that. sometimes i'm such a loner, 
that. i feel like sometimes people want to help me, 
but i always want to be able to stand on my own two 
feet, to provide for myself.

and maybe that's not always the easiest thing to do.

it really is hard.

Kenneth.
So here is one thing

I took a nap
I took time off of work to nap during may the fourth, and cinco de mayo
althou

although the precision of that statement isn;'t entirely correct.
Here is my idea;
I would like to take a nap.
I'm at work early. I left work early the other day. I'm tired. 
I'm a monster. Or. I was. In many ways... I just need to get some rest. I'm so tired.
This is a nightmare.

669

S9 here.
So here is what I've concluded about Marxism.
I'm decic8ng.
I'm decieving myself.

I'm not part of the proletariat.
I'm actually kind of. Really doing well for myself.
And. im going to create intellectual property. Called. Poems. They're already called. That. Of course.

There is one other possible way to deal with this email thing. and. it's an approach that I really don't want to take. 
I want to do this the right way. You know. the way that is the longest and hardest way possible.

the easiest thing to do would be to have submissions@chestnutandhazel redirect to info@chestnutandhazel, rather 
than set up submissions@chestnutandhazel as a stand alone email. or i mean, setting up submissions@chestnutandhazel all on it's own.
alright let's see. I think that I did it.

670

There you do. I think that I did it.
So I guess at some point I'll have to upgrade the services I use for my pet project, known as Chestnut + Hazel.  
theres Google Workspace, AWS, and Microsoft 365 or Azure or something.
I haven't figured out what to do about this. I don't want to spend any more money on this than I'm currently spending.
and.

my domain doesn't expire for a while, so. I might not be in the market for an upgrade for about 10 years.
anyway. I have the submissions@chestnutandhazel.com email set up. so that's done. I guess I can go back to whatever I was doing.
What else? nothing else for right now. I'm at my apartment, enjoying Bushmills, the rest of the bottle. I kind of want to play a computer game.

I think that everything that I need to get done, is done. so. I'll goof off for what's left of the day.
I'm getting together my college application. This is the third fucking time I've done this. UNLV, UMKC, and now UTA. I have to go.
What's one challenge that I'm facing? Well, I hardly know anyone out here. I don't want to get in contact with anyone from before Arlington.
Maybe I can ask the land lady for a letter of recommendation.

I just don't know. This is a nightmare. I don't know anyone.
I'm sure that I'll need a letter of recommendation. 
I don't. fucking. know anyone. I haven't made any friends or connections. maybe my land lady can write one.
One problem. Is. Running out of money before I get this started, or before I can get student loans. The general consensus is that going to 
graduate school is less prudent than going to a trade school or vocational school, but I definitely can't seem to get into a vocational school. 
I tried 3 times and I just couldn't do it. I have no idea what the fuck to do. This is a nightmare. A real nightmare.

Thinking about the issues that I've faced in the past. I think. I had an opportunity to go to UMKC, there was a position at the Post Office in 
Kansas City, that I declined, because it would have been less, in total, than what I was making working at the Tractor Warehouse and the Hotel.
but I remember thinking, that, maybe not going to UNLV or UMKC worked out for the best. The COVID-19 Pandemic hit, and, had I attended either 
UMKC or UNLV, it just wouldn't have worked out, or, it would have been disrupted in a major way.
With expectations of a recession, it might make sense for me to go to college now, this might be the. I don't want to think that this will be the 
last time that I do this. Running out of money is the biggest concern, right now.

671

but I have enough, don't I?
there are tests that you can 
take to find out what an idiot you are

there are tests that you can take
to determine how idiotic you are

silly you are so silly!

Norfolk is pronounced like Knorr, the soy sauce, and fuck, like the sexual act.
Knorr-Fuck is sex. using soy sauce as a lubricant.
Ennui is listlessness? or boredom.

I'm tired. I hardly got anything done today. 
I went to the post office, and ended up goofing 
around in Downtown Arlington, Texas. It's already the 
morning, the day after. and I'm still kind of tired.

So this position would require relocation, but I already 
renewed my lease for 1 year, so, I don't know how this 
position would be feasible. I applied anyway since it 
was on my list of places to apply at.

For a building company, however, I would actually be 
interested in a sales role. Or. I think that this is a 
building materials company.

What am I thinking. I still have to figure out the whole school 
thing. Mainly just getting my transcripts. I don't know why I 
don't have copies of these already saved. nightmare.
I think that I may have had them on my previous laptop, or the 
laptop I had before my previous laptop.
Fucking tired. Heat fatigue. When it's hot, you'll fell tired. that's just how it goes.

I was reading, in a Thomson Reuters newsletter, about a desalination plant in 
California that was blocked by environmentalists, and one things that the 
environmental group pointed out is that, water recycling is much less expensive, 
less energy intensive, and less destructive to marine life. and, even if the 
desalination plant is stopped, i'm sure that it can be retooled as a water 
purification plant anyway. or something. i don't think of myself as an environmentalist, 
I just happen to find the argument that they made compelling.

673

I haven't used ebay 
since I was last in Las Vegas, 
meaning. Back in 2019.

674

and I only used it for one thing. to buy 
a console. a gaming console. and it was 
kind of a bad purchase.

I'm coming across a large number of tasks 
that are incredibly time consuming. It isn't 
always really easy to make friends, or catch up with 
family, or shoot the shit with random strangers. 
There's really just too much shit to do. There's 
really just too much fucking shit to do. People 
get made if you don't waste time, but there really 
isn't a hell of a lot of time to waste. Why don't we 
watch TV all day? Why don't we play computer games all 
day? Why don't we chat about politics and all this other 
shit? All fucking day? Well, for one thing: I have all kind 
of other shit that I need to do all fucking day. and if 
I'm going to waste time, I'm going to waste it the way I want to waste it.

675

It always annoys me when someone tells me that I look tired. I am 
tired. In fact: I'm really fucking tired. Those people who don't 
look tired, they have privilege: Round Eye Privilege. Privileged Round Eye Individuals.

I'm usually really fucking tired. Those people who don't look tired, 
they have privilege. Round Eye Privilege. Privileged Round Eye Individuals.

I remember not really using Twitter until recently. I used 
Facebook for the longest time. Switching over from platform 
to platform isn't really all that easy. and signing up for 
new ones is usually a nightmare. I just don't want to sign 
up for any more of these. where they have been and the tree.

676

Okay. All of my bills are paid up through the end of 
June. I start work at the end of May. I think I might 
be okay, even if I don't get anything from Unemployment. 
I just need to make sure that I start working. Okay, what 
else? Let's see. I really don't want to tap my investment 
accounts more than I really need to.

team into a verloren hoop charge at the Wehrmacht's

678

I remember some of these twitter posts
I don't know why I was using twitter or 
why I started using twitter back when I wrote these. 
I guess. Maybe I was excited about it about twitter.

679

I fought for the Allies at Stalingrad as part of the 
Fried Rice Auxiliaries of the Red Army, Ho Chi Minh 
and Emiliano Zapata were my Comrades in Arms, but the 
Soviets had logistical problems then, as now, and we 
were given only one rifle for the three of us.

The reason I'm not entirely in favor of student loan 
forgiveness is this: education expenses receive a tax credit, 
a portion of student loan payments are tax deductible, so anyone 
receiving student loan forgiveness is triple dipping at the tax-payer's expense.

681

well, now that I have student loans.
you can guess what side of the discussion 
I am now on.

682

One of the reasons I'm not entirely in favor of student 
loan forgiveness is that: qualified education expenses 
receive a tax credit, a portion of student loan payments 
are tax deductible, so anyone receiving student loan 
forgiveness is triple dipping at the tax-payer's expense.

If Vladimir Putin thinks he's going to win: he's got another thing coming! Anglozilla and Danezilla are coming for Sovietzilla!
Another reason is that many employers offer tuition and education reimbursement incentives. It's not really a huge indignity to 
bag groceries, or pour coffee, or pack boxes, or count cash.

Spam emails. Some of this stuff I probably would buy, but right now. 
I kind of have to relax on any additional spending. when I think about 
what could possibly go wrong over the next few months: it just kind of 
makes me want to be cautious. and then there are the pictures. of the

Project Proposal:		To create a program that automatically creates
                                trading tickets for a security, for example, buy 
                                and sell orders for shares of an exchange traded fund.
                                
                                A user would only manually enter the first order, either to 
                                buy or sell a security, the program would populate and submit 
                                a new ticket based on the fulfillment of the previous ticket, 
                                the chain of tickets would continue until the user decided to
                                cancel the chain.
                                
                                Another application of this program would be to serve as a

I just completed the codewars version, and I'm coming back here to my leet code version, and it just. the solution I came up with seems 
so alien to me. there's so much stuff going on outside of the function. the two versions are different. obviously. but one. in one case. the 
leet code case, it's more for numbers, there's even a follow - up challenge where, they suggest trying to solve the same problem using 
some kind of mathematical formula. that's not something that can be done with words.

but the word version, the codewars you have to deal with upper and lower case letters, which is something that isn't a problem or 
something to be concerned about when working with numbers. in fact, when i realized. well, it wasn't the only problem, but one 
problem I was having was the to lower case part of the function. Anyway. I'm really glad that's over.

on to the haccker rank palindrome problem.

711

I just completed the codewars version, and I'm coming back here to my leet code version, and it just. the solution I came up with seems 
so alien to me. there's so much stuff going on outside of the function. the two versions are different. obviously. but one. in one case. the 
leet code case, it's more for numbers, there's even a follow - up challenge where, they suggest trying to solve the same problem using 
some kind of mathematical formula. that's not something that can be done with words.

Good Lord. I can't believe it finally worked.

If the Druidic Council approves reimbursement for 
Marijuana, I want to submit medical expense reports 
for medicinal blowjobs. You wouldn't believe how 
therapeutic blowjobs can be.

713

So I have an interview for a position tomorrow, and I'm actually 
kind of excited about it. The pay is in line with what I was making 
at Amazon, and sometimes I think: I'm probably more useful as a 
customer, than as an employee, although, I'm certain that I'm the 
most amazing employee of every company that I've ever worked at.

714

function isPalindrome(x) {
let reverse= x.split('').reverse().join('')
if (reverse.toLowerCase()==x.toLowerCase()){
return true;
}
else{
return false;
}
}

this looks the most like something I would have done, or 
the approach I would have taken, but it isn't clear to me 
why this works, and mine didn't

715

I don't know how overtime would work. 
I am serious about going back to college.

i'm annoyed that I'm having trouble with something 
as basic as this. annoyed. really annoyed.

i'm looking for something that looks like something 
i would have done, because, even if these solutions work,
it's not clear to me how they work. or why they work.

716

still slogging along on this trivial problem. part 2 is a calculator problem, and I'm really just 
not there yet. my idea is to convert the 4 function calculator into an options pricing calculator,
and it feels like doing this is an eternity away.

I really would like to go back to work. actually. I wouldn't mind collecting 
unemployment, but so far it has been a nightmare. the whole process. and. it's 
easier just to go back to work. they might not approve me anyway.

717

and, I guess in that vein, I guess I should no longer refer to 
my 7.5 inch Johnson as a form of currency, even though it is surely a 7.5 inch money maker!

718

I'm really tired. I've only gotten this far. the second problem out of the three.
I've been goofing off, but even goofing off is exhausting. I'm attending class, but 
I'm still working on Project 13. I'm actually just trying to figure out basic stuff.
I remember the leetcode version being for numbers, and this palindrome problem 
in codewars is more like the version I had in class, it deal with letters rather 
than numbers, a text string rather than a string of numbers.

719

I received a marketing email from Viator earlier today. I read it, 
but later marked it as spam and tossed it. i think that. part of the 
reason that I liked her was that. meeting her and working for her 
coincided with kind of a turning point in my life. i was homeless 
during my last year in San Jose, and i was struggling, and spending 
all my money. i don't have all bad memories of San Jose, and not 
everything was bad in las vegas, and things weren't really all that 
terrible in Missouri.

these are the things
that make the world sputter.

that other github account just. really isn't working. so. I guess I'll wait. I deleted all the other repositories, then
deleted the main repository, the created a new main respository for that account. and I'll wait to see if it publishes
to GitHub Pages. I tried deleting that account, but, to no avail.

I still haven't started on the testimonial,
and I more or less haven't started on Project 13, and
I honestly haven't been able to fall asleep.

I want to get some rest first, and then start
on Project 13, but I'm having a really hard time
falling asleep. I spent mountains of time on project 12,

but honestly, I really think that what I came up 
with was worth every minute of the hella-ton of hours
that I spent on it. I really love the customized responses.

720

This whole thing of a respository within a repository did not work. Remember this.
this is actually pretty cool. i set up my other repository as a directory 
with in my main repository.

"I WANT TO BE A WRITER!" in 
re "I WANT TO BE A WRITER!" by Ashley Frangipane (2020)

okay, so. sometimes
my poems are
corny or trite or pompous.

sometimes your poems
are slutty and bitchy.
give me a break.

722

I've come back around to project 14 to update the map links to 
leaflet, to give all the pages a customized location. project 14 
hasn't been graded yet, so I figured I would spend a little 
more time on it, plus, it is my project, and I want it to be 
interesting. I also Kind of need to get myself into work mode, 
since I've just been playing computer games for so many days, and 
not really doing anything else.

I'm almost done with this, and it was somewhat quicker than I 
thought that it would be, I actually have to redo a Professional 
Development Project, the last one. and I also still have to get back 
to project 15. Alright, so all the maps are done and updated for 
project 14, I don't think that it was necessary to do 20 different 
leaflet pages, but, I think it looks nice, plus I have a few
leaflet pages for the hamburgers project I did a while ago.

but, getting back to project 15. I think that I'm going to start with a 
few simple things that just use the CDN before I start using all those 
packages I installed. That's all done, project 14 
is done in a way that I like it. DONE!

This was not too exciting, boring, a few stuff using the React CDN, 
and all of this stuff is stuff from the React Website itself. I'm 
going to test out a few more CDN React things, and then try something
else with react. This should be really useful, when I think about my 
most recent update to the Chestnut + Hazel Connections project, I had 
to create 20 seperate Jennifer Connelly Pages, and 20 different Meet 
Me at our Spot pages, that's 40 pages that I had to create, and 
supposedly I wouldnt have to do that if I could set up create for that 
project.

723

Even with as much time as I've spent on this, and seemingly no closer to getting a JSON file working, I seem to have
made a breakthrough with this carousel. The iframes look like they are interactive in a way that they were not interactive
in the original Project 10 version of the carousel.

I'm setting up links to see if the iframes in the carousel work, and if they do, then that means this should work. and I can
get project 14 completed, even though this seems like it was kind of a long digression from the requirements of project 14.


One possible nightmare is that it might not be necessary for to really target huge population centers to create a lot of havoc, 
key logistical infrastructure, telecommunications infrastructure, energy and electricity infrastructure, food infrastructure and 
transport infrastructure. He doesn't have to create very many casualties to create a lot of collateral damage.

724

there isnt anyting else other than getting through the day.
Life is so f****** boring. But then. What else is there?
dont know why. Bored as s***.
these past few day have been s***. Or felt like s***.
im feeling sad for some reason.

725

This folder is where I will put any notes and course material related to our earlier javascript lessons. 
I really have to start from the beginning because there are so many things I just, either forgot, or didn't 
fully understand.

I was having nightmares of people in SWAT or Special Forces gear.

Adventure # 6 - 10/12/2023 20:47
I am exhausted. I have a meeting tomorrow regarding admission to UNLV. I have to figure this out. It's not
clear to me what we will be discussing. I don't know how many times I've sent transcripts and submitted
applications to UNLV, and all that.

729

I don't know what's on my mind exactly. I'm tired. Going back to work for those two weeks or whatever. It made
me realize that. I don't know. Like. Working in a factory or a warehouse is going to be just another dead end.
It's never really gone anywhere, and, as far as I can tell, it's not really going to go anywhere.

730

I remember going into one interview recently and, there was this kind of weird moment where, the interviewer
seemed to. Well, she stated that she was looking for someone who was looking to stay with the organization for
the next 20 years or something. and I was thinking. I was thinking later, but. do I really plan 20 years ahead?
do I have a 20 year plan? because I already know that I don't have a 20 year plan, but if I did have a 20 year plan
or, something. I sure as hell wouldn't be interviewing for your company.

731

you know.
if I have to plan for the next 20 years, the most obvious thing to do is not to work for some company that I don't
see myself working at for 20 years. you know. like I don't really see myself working there for 20 years, or even 2 years.

You know. There isn't a single company that I've ever worked for, or that I've ever applied for, that I really saw myself
working at for 20 years.

I mean the most obvious thing to do, if I'm planning for the next 20 years. is. to go back to college. develop some
new skill or whatever.

732

Adventure # 5 - 10/12/2023 02:48
So what am I thinking about right now. I got sidetracked from putting down my thoughts for Adventure # 4. Well.
I don't know. I tend to be bombarded with stuff. Various stuffs. Various things. This or that. Whatever. I started
obsessing over the color of the buttons on my landing page. made a little bit of progress. realized I don't know
jack about javascript. figured I'd get around to it later. and then I started 
obsessing over my project carousel. so that's basically what happened. I'm tying to recollect about what happend 
yesterday, and the things I'm thinking about for the next couple days. The forseeable future, which as of right now.
can be measured only. in days.

733

I got sidetracked yet again. I don't know where I was.
Quam pulchra es sicut ibi stabat Qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet consectetur 
ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem Quae te dementia cepit Forsan et 
haec olim meminisse juvabit Militat omnis amans  omnia vincit amor  

734

I got sidetracked yet again. The above text should read something like 
How beautiful you are standing there! who gullibly believes you are everything? 
who seeks pain to derive some pleasure from pain? What madness
posesses you? We will remember this fondly: every lover is a fighter: Love conquers all.
This is basically just a collage of different latin quotes. Famous ones. including the most famous latin text of all: 

lorem ipsum.
This is supposed to be funny. The most famous latin quote should be omnia vincit amor, love conquers all, but I don't think that it is, i mean, more
well known than lorem ipsum. the other funny thing is that, delorem ipsum, is from, i guess, cicero, but his most famous line should actually be:

Carthago delenda est
and um, I guess I came across: Militat omnis amans, from Ovid
which translates to:

every lover
is
a fighter

Which is really funny because that's clearly a response to the phrase: "I'm a lover not a fighter." 
and he does this to omnia vincent amore as well, where he say something like:

Love conquers all? so too will I triumph over love!
but I couldn't find that quote online, or at least, I had a lot of trouble finding it because all searches for
Omnia vincent amore, ovid come up only with virgils original line.
anyway.

735

I got sidetracked again, I had an ititial version of project 8 that I was having a lot of trouble with, so, I stopped working on it and
started completely over. There is a screenshot of it in my media folder. I don't know what the issue was. or. I don't remember since project 8
feels like it was something I did such a long time ago, but whatever it was. I think it was that I was having trouble changing things. so I started with
a different templete or whatever it's called in wordpress, and deleted more or less everything but the color scheme, and re-did the entire
thing element by element. so. that's how it went. super easy and I really enjoyed it.

I feel like there was something I'm supposed to do today, but, whatever it is, it's clearly slipped my mind.

Adventure # 4 - 10/11/2023 23:04
There are a number of things on my mind, but I'm not sure what to write about first.
I might be able to get into UNLV. I have no idea how many times I've applied there, and for how many
different programs, but finally getting in would be nice. I feel so bad about dropping out of grad school
at UTA a year ago, and, if I ever get around to making it up to Yibing Du and Thomas Thompson, I'll reapply 
at somepoint in the future and get a degree at UTA.
anyway.

I'm glad it's still, only Wednesday, even if, at 23:13, it's pretty much already Thursday. I have a metting with,
I don't know exactly, the admissions person, or, well, it's critical that I meet with him in order to get into the program.
I'm glad it's still Wednesday.

One of the issues I have with what I post on chestnutandhazel.com is that It's hosted, or whatever, it's really just an account
on blogger.com, so since it's basically a social media account, I have to comply with the community guidles of blogger.com, and
since I have adsense active on that page, I also have to comply with any adsense advertiser standards, so I have my hands tied 
in many respects. chestnutandhazel.com continues to get flagged over and over and over, and in many cases I don't really want to 
deal with it right away.

the other issue is that I also have to post what I write somewhere, so that I can use the standard copyright registration form,
rather than the unpublished copyright registration form, so, that's another issue. so you know, it's kind of whatever.

This is a photograph of a mixed media composition. I took two paintings that I bought by a local artist, put a Zoloft pen 
on top of the painting of Jack Torrance, and then took pictures of my masterpiece, and then photo edited the result. 
The paintings are by Vanessa Callanta. what stood out to me about Callanta's Painting "All Work and No Play" was how 
calm Jack Torrance looked. i think it's the use of blue. Jack Torrance typically wore red shirts in The Shining.

I'm more tired than ever. More than

I consider this published, even if it's unlikley anyone will come across this
or read it. There are times when I want to write things, but, less and less I feel
the desire to write them on chestnutandhazel.com I don't know what it is, but, I'm
starting to feel more "On Stage" when I write and post things there.

745

Maybe a few years back it seemed, it 
felt like there wasn't anyone really, you know
reading it.

746

I'm really feeling unhappy.

I need to be working on Project 11, but for some reason I'm just not really getting anything done.
I've managed to figure out where my Contact Form is. It's something that I haven't really messed with
in a while, but Project 11 entails messing with it. So. That's what I'm up to.

There's a lot of cleaning up that needs to be done with the index page of my Github Repository,
and a lot of that cleaning up, with the code, cleaning up the appearance of my code wouldn't
really change the outward appearance of my page. It would just make it easier to change things around
but, considering that the course is almost over, I'm not really sure how much it makes sense to really
do anything about it.

I really have to get Project 11 done. I was reviewing the recording of the class session, and
it looks easy, and, I remember it being easy when I was doing it. I don't remember, but I 
think that I napped through part of the class, and came back around to it later.

One of the things about the class is that, I'm much more open to distance learning, or online coursework, or virtual classrooms,
or whatever, now that I've done it, back in 2018 or 2019 I think that I was really skeptical about it, and
I kind of brushed off a recruiter for an online degree program, but um, I think that I'm more open to it now.

I tried to get the favicon to work on GitHub, but, I can't seem to figure it out, and, since it's not an assignment,
I really didn't pursue the thing past the point of absolute frustration.

The favicon is more vanity than any kind of practical kind of a thing. Like I don't have a practical reason for setting 
up the favicon on GitHub other than the desire to have one.

I'm exhausted, and I really haven't done anything for project 11 yet.
I want to take a nap, but, that's a little bit of a risk considering that it's due today.
and, I really have to get to it because, in all probability, it's something that can be done in an hour or two, at most.
I'm so tired. I want to get a soda.

747

I don't know what to do about CodePen. Migrating things to github is a small nightmare.

<!-- 10102023 1008 I got sidetracked with a number of other things and I'm still working on this. -->

I'm feeling incredibly scatter brained. I have a project due for my software and web development course today, and I haven't even started. 
This should be simple, so I'm not too worried about it, but, at the same time, I know from the past that these things could take quite 
a while if I hit a brick wall.

There are other issues that I'm facing, especially on the income front. The temp assignment was not a particularly good fit, and, I 
really get the feeling that I should avoid any kind of warehouse or factory work, even though, that's sort of what I've been doing 
for the past five years, but I don't have the slightest clue what to look for.

Life is such an unbelievable struggle. I don't really know what to do about money. Somewhere in the back of my mind there's 
this voice telling me that I should stop looking for a job or employment or whatever, and, that I should focus on trying to 
make money doing stock market shit.

Reflection # 714 by Chestnut and Hazel
I don't know exactly what I've been spending on buying lunch and soda at work, 
but I know that it is too damn much, I want to say it is around 15 dollars per day. 
Too fucking much. I have to cut down on that for sure.
By Chestnut + Hazel at June 11, 2019 
Notes written on 10/10/2023 @ 10:19 AM

I think that I wrote this post while I was working at Case New Holland. I'm surprised that I was really spending that much. I 
Wonder what I was buying? I don't really remember. I think that it was mostly energy drinks. I don't remember my exact hours. 
It was overnight is as much as I remember. In Cameron, MO there isn't really much to eat if you're up at odd hours.

I'm working on Project 11 for my Web and Software Development course. I'm not really getting much done. I'm getting sidetracked
with other things. I'm really amazed that I get so little done, especially considering that I've had few other obligations other
than class these past few months. I really wonder what I've been doing.

Earlier in the course I would have a lot of fun playing around with our daily assignments, but, I haven't really done that in a
while, even though there have been plenty of opportunities to do so.

"Clothes 28" by Kenneth Larot Yamat By Chestnut ﹠ Hazel 
at January 19, 2019 originally posted at chestnutandhazel.com
I watched two documentaries.
One on the Sino Japanese war.
The one that morphed into world
War 2. And one on the Japanese
Industrial revolution.

So. I wanted to think about why
Things ended at the OTA. It's been
A while. And I think. Deserves some
Reflection.

Lets say that all decisions can be
Simplified. That all decisions
Come to a fork. Bifurcate or
Whatever. Like. You are faced
With a decision. And your choices
Are always two. At first.

Think of this. In a standard road.
You have two choices when you
Reach an intersection. You can
Continue down the road. Or turn.
Two choices. If you choose to
Turn. You can choose left or right.
Two choices. And so on. Some
Might think of this as three choices.
You can travel straight. Left. Or right.
But you can also think of it the way
I did. Of two choices. One choice
Having two sub choices.

750

Which way of thinking is more
Simple? Which way of thinking is
Less convoluted? Which way of
Thinking is cleaner. I have no idea.
But I think. That bifurcation allows
Points in the decision making
Process to be more clearly marked.
And either way. You can still account
For all possible decisions.

So back to my former boss at the
OTA. She could have extended me.
Or she could have decided not to
Extend me. We already know what
Decision she made. But let's figure
Out what she was thinking.

Now. It didn't bother me that I wasn't
Formally employed by the OTA.
Who cares right? Some people do
Though. Some people do like to
Be official or whatever.

And I'm not being dismissive
About the desire to be official.
I wanted to be official with Ash.
But she didn't want to be official
Unless we were super fucking
Official.

751

In my thinking though. Even when a
Person is formally employed. Their
Continued employment is really
Just an extension. It just goes by
A different term. People think of
It differently. But I don't. People
Think of it differently because
Different words are used. But I'd say
The mechanics of being a contractor
On an extension basis. And being
A formal employee whose
Performance is measured at
Regular intervals. It's the same
Thing. If you aren't handed a pink
Slip when you show up for work.
You have been extended. Haha.

So she could have extended me.
Or not extended me. If she extended
Me. I don't know what would
Happen. Would she have to buy
My contract from the staffing
Agency? And pay some kind
Of a premium to do so? I have no
Idea.

752

I don't know what the extension
Decisions would be. If she would
Have been forced to decide whether
Or not to keep me on a contract
Basis indefinitely. Or decide to
Make me a formal employee of the
OTA. I have no idea. Really no idea.

And maybe that is where the issue
Arose. Maybe the issue was that
She had to decide whether or not
To formalize my employment or
Not. She may have wanted to
Extend. But could not formalize
My employment for whatever
Reason. And maybe formalizing
Was the only way to extend.

So basically. Maybe she wanted to
Extend. But not formalize. Since
She could not extend without
Formalizing. She therefore could
Not extend. So she decided not
To extend. And maybe that was it.

I want to say that body language

Miscommunication. And
Misinterpretation. It is difficult

Is difficult to interpret meaning
Through body language.

I think of the invention of
Writing. And why writing is
Nessecary. It's because. Someone.
Somewhere. Kept making the wrong

based on the most recent
thing that we came across we
decided that the best thing to do was to see where it all was.

I know what to do now, like going forward and stuff. I'm going to say this:

757

"Yeah, I know a whole bunch of stuff, all the craziest dirt and everything. Basically. 
I have all the information you need, even the things that other people don't know, and even the things that other people couldn't even imagine."

maybe you know the things that you haven't
already learned so you will learn them.

have you told anyone else how much I am your favorite

Like, Vladimir Putin might just target off-shore drilling sites 
and pipeline infrastructure, and he might not use armaments to do so. 
He might not use conventional weapons. Consider that his background 
before entering politics was working for the Russian intelligence 
agency. He might just send in saboteurs to wreak havoc.

760

Other nightmares. Well
I had this thought that Vladimir Putin 
was behind the violence in Buffalo, NY
and the reason being is that
he did mention Nukes over New York City,
and 
Vladimir Putin might just be using the word
Nukes
to mean 
Weapons of Mass Destruction
and
I was thinking that the violence in Buffalo, NY
could spiral into mass civil unrest
and I think that
mass civil unrest
is a kind of
Weapon of Mass Destruction.
fomenting unrest
and
inciting a revolt 
are tools that he might be attempting to use

sometimes it's real or isn't real. i think that for this series, 
i'm going to type in all lowercase letters. this is the first day of my indefinite hiatus.
i don't ever want to be reminded of this again and I have no idea why these posts.
are here. did I do that?

today was a kind of a normal day i guess. i'm tired. sometimes 
i need to smoke, and i go outside, and someone is always there. or 
arrives shortly after i arrive. what is the hiatus? i think that a 
hiatus is when something is delayed. // are where they think they are 
whatever i'm waiting for. i still seem to be waiting for it.
i also have to remember to buy sneakers. i already have shoes and boots, 
but i think that i have boots that would actually meet the specifications 
listed in the job description, so i may be able to wear those if my boots 
don't arrive. i might need to start shopping now actually.
or, to put it another way, i may need to actually start shopping now.

764

i'm super tired. what i think is. it's getting hot again. 
i think i need to just stay inside. i think it's the actual 
sun that is actually burning me right now. so tired.

765

I did think about her the other day. but. I didn't want to. I don't.
I really don't know what to think.
I don't know what to say.
Sometimes I wonder.
I don't know. I'm still unhappy about a lot of things.

The vape pen has been

I don't know. One thing about the Buffalo, New York incident is that 
this might spill over into something similar to the civil unrest during the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the riots and the insurrections.
This could end up being a nightmare. I'm afraid. I don't know. I was
hoping that things would get better, but who knows.

768

I'm stressed out. I feel like things
are more difficult than they should be.
as though. as though the universe 
is fucking with me, and i'm really 
fucking unhappy about it.

New sheet 
of paper.

There is a networking event 
on campus today, and I really 
don't want to go. It's not mandatory, 
but. I want to go, but I also really
don't want to go.

nothing is really going right for me 
right now and I'm really not.

I really don't enjoy interacting with 
other people unless I have something 
positive to say, and have good things 
or pleasant things to talk about.

779

I just finished reading I would leave me If I Could: a collection of poetry / Halsey, Ashley Frangipane (2020).
There were times when I wanted to throw that book against the wall, but, I didn't, and there were plenty of times where I really enjoyed her poems.
Some of the poems reminded me of. some of the def jam poetry sessions that i remember reading when i was in my early 20s.
i bought a hardcover copy because i don't remember there being a paperback version available.

780

college. unemployment. social security disability. and work. these. are the things that i kind of have to focus on 
right now. my head is killing me. i slept most of the other day. and. by the time i woke up. it was 400 PM or something. 
and there was really nothing much that i was able to get done.

781

I think that it would be nice if some of Halsey's lyrics were 
included in another book of poems, or her next book of poems or whatever.

I have not been 
looking for an employer

What else do I have to do? my head is pounding. 
I want to read violet bent backwards over the grass.

I added a few items to my wish list, but, then 
i realized that i was getting carried away. so . I'll leave it alone for now.

Greetings University of Texas at Arlington:

I’ve decided to pursue an education at the University of Texas at Arlington 
due to the location of the institution: it’s within walking distance of my 
current residence, and at the center of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Area. 
This is the third educational institution that I’ve attempted to pursue and obtain 
an advanced degree from, having previously applied to the University of Nevada at 
Las Vegas, and the University of Missouri at Kansas City. I was accepted to both 
institutions, however, due to distractions of one variety or another: financial, 
romantic, or professional, or even some infernal combination of all three; I found 
myself unable to attend either institution.

What I aspire to, from an educational and academic standpoint, is to be accepted 
into the Quantitative Finance, M.S. program at the University of Texas at Arlington, 
complete the program, get a master’s degree, write numerous profound academic treatises 
and scholarly articles, submit them to academic journals, and win the greatest awards 
and recognitions for everything that I do. I want the papers I write to be cited by 
all other academics in Finance and Economics and even by academics in Personal Finance 
and Home Economics.

There hasn’t been much reflection on my part as to what I intend to accomplish and achieve 
professionally after graduating from the Quantitative Finance, M.S. program offered by the 
University of Texas at Arlington. Pecuniary interests have never been the primary focus in 
my life or in my professional pursuits, however, I’m absolutely certain that all of the 
most amazing doors in the Universe will open as soon as I graduate from the program.

Sincerely,

Kenneth Larot Yamat

these are where you
are and you
are here and when 
you went somewhere
else you took everything
I thought you 
were in possession of.

hear the sound
of when
you are
here and when
the sound of how you
spoke and how you 
smell when
you talk about how good
it is and how you
smell when you are
sweaty from activities

that are more

I'm a little bit 
frustrated right now.

What I'm frustrated with right 
now, is that there is an 
application fee. and shit. 
there's just a bunch of stuff 
right now that's fucking irritating. 
nightmare.

what the hell do I need?
and i also took a photograph of my cigar. 
now. i didn't snort a single gram of the 
tobacco smoke, nor did I inhale. at 
least not in the last ten years or so.

I don't enjoy reading Hustler Magazine, 
I much rather peruse Hustler Magazine,

Larry Flynt.

I fact: I consider it a travesty and desecration to the sacred 
act of making facetious remarks, a power and privilege that all 
of us are endowed by our creator. or whatever. uh. not to codify 
the facetious remarks amendment to the constitution of the 
united north americans

When there are hard times, there continue to be hard times, and 
there will always be things that you don't need to do and there 
will be things that make you unhappy where you will be where things
that are not nice and when you are unhappy there are things needed.

806

so what do i do next?
i have to stay off twitter for a while. it's a major time and energy drain. 
i really. i really only spend time reading my own tweets over and over again.
that's really the only 
part of
twitter that I really enjoy.

807

I'll put in one application per day.
there's some issue where I have to contact 
the Texas Workforce Commission. or go to 
their office or something?

still tired. or kind of tired. 
This guy at the pizzeria was being 
a dick. so I left. but that's more 
or less all i did today.

think about micro-aggressions. micro-hostilities. 
small indignities. hate crimes. tribal wars. 
race wars. ethnic cleansings. and genocides.

I think that they are all part of the 
same spectrum of issues. they are all 
part of a failure to be polite, tactful, 
and diplomatic.

808

one issue in a multi-cultural. pluralistic. 
inclusive. and tolerant society is that it's 
hard to figure out what's polite. and what's 
offensive. there are always going to be mis-understandings.

the idea is to de-escalate. brinkmanship is a nightmare.
some people get a kick out of it. in this business community. the political community. on the global stage. whatever. you know.
the think about. a lot of the demagoguery that's going on in politics is that. i don't know. i just might end up in bad places.

anyway. it's just so fucking hot.
This is kind of cool, I found a kind of cool position.

One of the reasons that I only ever apply to positions 
on the S&P 500 list is that I've had trouble with 
companies and employers that aren't major companies.

809


The assembler position is close to were I live. So that's nice.
I guess. the next place that I'll apply is
I really feel bad when. There are calls for donations. or 
solicitations for donations, and I really don't have any money.
I have money, however. I just really can't spend any money.

810

I'm usually really fucking tired. 
Those people who don't look tired, 
they have privilege. Round Eye Privilege. 
Privileged Round Eye Individuals.

I remember not really using Twitter until 
recently. I used Facebook for the longest 
time. Switching over from platform to 
platform isn't really all that easy. and 
signing up for new ones is usually a nightmare. 
I just don't want to sign up for any more of these.

Okay. All of my bills are paid up through the 
end of June. I start work at the end of May. 
I think I might be okay, even if I don't get 
anything from Unemployment. I just need to 
make sure that I start working. Okay, what 
else? Let's see. I really don't want to tap 
my investment accounts more than I really need to.

now, and we were given only one rifle for the three of us.

Spam emails. Some of this stuff I probably would buy, 
but right now. I kind of have to relax on any 
additional spending. when I think about what could 
possibly go wrong over the next few months: it just 
kind of makes me want to be cautious.

I am not doing OKAY right now. I am not doing well 
right now. Things are not going right at the 
moment, and everything is not going right. this is

I don't know what this list of names was originally 
in reference to. maybe people I wanted to read about. 
or something. or whatever. or something something. or something.

I actually want to donate to Nancy Pelosi, 
but then I would also have to donate to. I

bull shit right now. Stop emailing me.

822

Anyway. I think I've taken care of the stuff for my 
Unemployment Claim. I think that I went over this 
before. I'm not sure if my claim would be approved, 
since I resigned for personal reasons. Part of the 
reason I filed for unemployment is because I'm unemployed, 
and, I believe that it's important to be part of the tally 
of the unemployed. I think of filing an Unemployment Claim 
as similar to participating in the Census, or Voting, or 
filing a Tax Return. The Unemployment Numbers are an important 
metric that decision makers use when deciding where and how to 
employ capital, if they are investors, or where and how to employ 
economic stimulus, if they are politicians or bureaucrats, or 
where and how to employ philanthropic efforts, if they are philanthropists. 

where everyone sees what the end 
of the story is and what the thing 
is where the things goes into the best 
of the worst where the things are the
test and how you can see where the best 
where they are and how they do what they 
see and how they cannot be the worst of the
test of them all and how they can be where.

823

Anyway. What else do I have to do? Other 
college stuff, I think. I mean. College 
application stuff. I'm really fucking tired 
all the time. and I'm really. I really get 
distracted with other stuff too.

824

when the end of everything starts the 
beginning of everything and how these 
are the latest of where they are and 
they can be better than whatever they 
were before and newer and more novel.

Okay: Twitter Blue or Twitter for 
Professionals? Here's the thing: there 
is a Twitter Parody Policy for Professional 
Accounts, and I've never figured this out, 
how is a factious remarks focused account 
different from parody account? and at what 
point have I crossed the line?

I'm really tired. I napped for a few hours, but I didn't get any actual sleep.
I have some unrelated good news. I don't have to enroll in. I don't have to
worry about enrolling in classes at UNLV until late november,

this means i can just focus on the stuff i already had going on
the software development class ends mid november. so i'll have some time to 
loaf around or something. well, even if. the spring semester at UNLV wouldn't start until 
next year. i think. so i would still have december to loaf around. 

assuming i'm still unemployed.
I'm tired and I really don't know where to start
Project 12 beat me to death, and Project 13 is already due tomorrow.
nightmare. total. nightmare.

<p> I'm exhausted right now. I think I slept all of Sunday, and, most of Monday. Today is Monday, and I slept through most of it. I did watch a few 
movies: Donnie Darko (2001), Pi (1998), and Dances with Wolves (1990). I have a few class assignments to work on. Project 13 is done. It required 2-3 
problems to be worked on, and I did 2, LeetCode and CodeWars, I would like to work on a HackerRank problems, but, since it's not part of Project 
13's requirements, it's basically a personal project at this point, and it's the same sort of situation with converting the calculator project 
into an options pricing calculator, it's not required, so it's a personal project if I decide to pursue it. [were when you said that things were]
[great and nice and cold and heads will be] 0 [there was something] </p> [there were interesting things that were amazing that were neat that were]

[get more of the best things and more the thing] <p> [that were more and more] [ and never and never and when and never and how and never and this ]
I'm really tired. I haven't done much today, other than play on the computer. I need to get my assignments done, I don't think there is anything 
else I have to do for Project 13. I have to look into project 14. [ put off for now what you think is the wrong ] [ thing of the best ideas that can't]

This is still 
to me still 
it's still a work of poetry.

873

I would still say that this is 
primarily a work of poetry this is a poem.

[I would still say that this is a work of poetry] <p>...</p>
[I would classify this as a poem] <p class= "adventuretitle" >
Adventure # 34 - 10/29/2023 02:41 </p> [I would insist that this]

[is a work of poetry] <p> I don't know what to do right now. I'm really thirsty, 
and I want to go out and get a few sodas. but, [that this was the poem the latest]
I also don't want to go out right now, this early in [one that I was working on]

the morning. I kind of just want to stay home right now, but, I'm really thirsty. 
I was playing Rome Total War 2, and, I was attacked by another 
faction, and, at the time I just really didn't want to fight that particular battle, 
so I signed out and went back [I would still say that this is a work of poetry]
to working on class work. but, I'm also not really in the mood to do any classwork 
right now. Today is Sunday, but I still have [this was what i was working on]
things that I have to get done, even if the urgency is slightly less than it 
would otherwise be.

874

what do I have to do? [but it could potentially create huge problems later massive issues]
[what can you do where can you be] </p> [ this is where it was all going to be ] 
[ where everything is really unhappy ] [what they find is that making happiness]
<p>I did a little bit of work on chestnutandhazel.com trying to fix a few things here and there, but 
it takes a long time. trying to fix things. I had to deal with a small disaster. basically, i cloned a 
GitHub Repository to my main repository, creating a repository that is both a repository, and a directory 
within a repository. It created problems. Don't do it. I thought it would make things easier, but it didn't.

it's a mess. Anyway. that was a small disaster. My miscellaneous 
repository, the one where I have project 13, seems fine,  
but there were uncommitted  changes in my main repository that 
couldn't be committed  and pushed, so I have no idea if I lost anything 
or not. [ these were where they were all at where things went and broke them down]
[how do you make new things happier than they were] </p> [you can be happy and still new]

<p> but for reference, the way i solved the problem was this: i couldn't push the 
changes to GitHub because the file was too large, and 
took too long to upload, and it exceeded the allowable file size, so I basically 
had to delete the local files, restart my computer [poem]
because several of the files were in use by my computer, remove the repositories 
from GitHub Desktop and VS Code, and then pull and fetch the repositories from 
GitHub again. oh, and i also had to delete the offending file, the 
huge file that was too large to deal with, directly from GitHub. 

there seems to have been a way to remove the file from my committed  
changes, before pushing, but, i deleted the file locally before i could do 
that, so [were all talking to eachother about this still being an amazing]
for some reason i couldn't remove it from my list of committed  
changes to push. anyway. I think it's more or less resolved at this point.
[I would say yes!] </p> [and how they were all amazing where they were all amazing where they]

<p> Sometimes I wonder why I never seem to have enough time, or enough energy to do things, and 
well. part of the reason is that I spend a lot of time doing things that don't really accomplish anything.
    
I spent some time trying to fix an older GitHub account: KennethLarotYamat-as-chestnutandhazel <br> <br>and it just still doesn't 
seem to be working. I remember when I first set it up, and, i remember following the instructions over and over and nothing 
seemed to happen. <br><br> i thought that, now, since I have more experience with GitHub, I could come back around to it and fix it, but 
well, no such luck. as far as I can tell, it's still broken. <br><br> i'll worry about it later. I really can't believe it is already 
the 27th. I'm about to go on 4 months without any income. 
  
</p> but where were they and how did they [say that they were going back to where they were]
<p> I spent some time napping, but not getting any actual sleep, the time is 05:44 AM</p>
that was the way it was when they told everyone of the greatness.

876

there was an on-campus event today, it started earlier,
but I don't know. I wanted to go, but I also really did 
not want to go. I don't really have anything good to say.

what would I say? everything is a disaster? nothing is 
going right? I think. well. It's a disaster. nothing is
going right. nothing is working out. everything is falling
apart. noting is going right. nothing is going right.

<p>I need to see how this works. I set it up so that the triggering order is cancelled at the end of the day if it isn't filled. If the triggering order 

is cancelled, the untriggered order should also be cancelled, but, if the triggering order is filled, the triggered order should stay open until cancelled. 
I'm entering this order to make sure that this is how it works.
[but I think] </p>
<p>...</p><p class= "adventuretitle" >Adventure # 30 - 10/26/2023 07:50</p>
[that things often go wrong] <p>

880

I cancelled all open orders and put a new set of orders in. I have to start paying more attention to this again. I think I have, not a new approach, but an adjustment
in mind. I don't want to have too many orders open at any given time. So I'm thinking that I have to adjust and merge orders as I go along. One issue that
I'm facing right now is that I don't have very much cash to work with. With the T + 2 settlement restrictions that I'm facing, I can really only
trade a third of my cash on any given day, and I kind of tied up a lot of it writing that cash secured put option. The idea was that I could collect interest on
the cash collateral, in addition to collecting the premium for writing the put option as well as getting 100 shares into SPLG for less than 49.90. I'll see how this goes, 
the put option has a November 17 expiration date.

881

<p>...</p> [ they might be, more exciting than they were, more amazing than they were, more amazing than they were]
<P>I was thinking, what if instead of writing a put option, I bought a call option instead, well, doing that would only accomplish 1 out of the 3 targets I had in place 

sure, I could collect interest on the cash, but I would be paying a premium of 380 buying a 49 strike call, rather than collecting a premium of 
60 on a 50 strike put, I also wouldn't 
be getting into SPLG for less than 49.90. I would also currently be facing a much larger unrealized loss than the already somewhat large 
unrealized loss I'm currently facing.

I cancelled all of my outstanding orders, the ones that weren't 
filled, and I'm going to figure out a plan of action for what to do next. The issue is that
all the outstanding orders I have, or had. before I cancelled 
them, they were all sell orders. I don't really want to be dealing with what I was dealing with 
earlier, you know, only in the opposite direction: having, 
on any given day, a whole bunch of sell orders go through without any corresponding buy orders go through.

in a while, but the last time I checked into it, I remember that in order to monetize videos on YouTube, your channel has to reach a certain threshold in terms 
of views, viewers, and view time, before being able to monetize. I think that I'll eventually add narrations.

but there were times 
when thing were worse than 
they are right now 
times when thigngs were
even more terrible!

[I don't want things to get] <p> I don't know. It still seems. Well, I don't see any reason to change it right now. anyway. 
what else do I need to do. I've essentially [any worse than they could already be they are as horrible as they could be!]
been doing nothing but gaming since. Saturday Morning. I feel like only doing as much as I absolutely need to, and then going back to my game.
Do I have any life updates? well. My vehicle registration renewal sticker came in the mail, and I put it on my license plate.
maybe when things were more terrible they were even going to get even better </p> but really: who knows! they could have gotten worse! 

<p> What am I thinking right now? I realized I made a few errors while calculating my estimates. I made a few really basic errors. 
Hella dumb. for my estimate for SPLG for 10/20, for example. [Seriously!]
[and there are nothing - there are no things that are worse than what the were suspected to be]
I took the midpoint and subtracted the range from the midpoint to estimate the low and added it to the midpoint to estimate the high. No wonder I didn't have
any sell orders for that day.
there was nothing else when there were nothing there was nothing that couldn't be done while it was even worse! </p> so much worse!

[frustrated right now really frustrated right now.] <p> Anyway: what's the minimum amount of stuff I need to get done today? </p>

<p> This is funny. Right on the dot. I've been playing Rome Total War 2 since. Well, almost 12 hours straight. There are actually
a few other things that I need to be working on. but, this is interesting. I really don't play computer games anymore or. all that much 
anymore, but a few months ago I started playing again, and, it's really been eating up a lot of my time. I made a hell of a lot of videos these past 
few hours, in fact. I pushed out publish dates into late December, releasing 1 video every three days. My screen recorder isn't working right now. So I'm taking 
this time to get some writing done.

<p>[sometimes the meeting cannot take place!]
The other day. When I was completing paperwork for UNLV, one of the attestations for recieving in-state tuition rates was declaring that I intend to make Nevada
my permanent residence. It was a hard question for me because. Whether or not I intend to stay in Nevada is contingent upon whether or not I'm able to attend 
college here. To me this was one of those chicken and egg problems. The other issue that made it a difficult question to answer is that. I kind of have 
to stay here. Even if I could leave. I kind of have to stay here. I really don't have any other choice. I really don't know what to do. Not that there is 
really anything I can do.

<p>...</p><p class= "adventuretitle" >Adventure # 20 - 10/20/2023 18:44 </p>[all these other things that were west of the]

<p> Okay, so there's that. Um, so the day in review.  I realized I made a mistake here, on my "Estimate for 10/20" um, the low should be
an estimate of 49.72. I put in 1 trade for 10 shares. Sell at the estimated high and buy at the estimated low, but I didn't put in 
a reverse order as well, because at this point I have way many shares than I can comfortably function with. I don't know why I was targeting
400 shares. I think that I was carrying that figure forward from. you know. when I was employed. and had a paycheck.
</p> <p>I think as some point I came to the conclusion that I it would be best to keep my position at around 200 shares, but didn't really

adjust everything, like, my outstanding orders and all that. I sold 5 and bought 83, or, I had sell orders for 5 shares filled, 
and buy orders totaling 83 shares filled. this is in addition to writing a put option which, at this point, is basically like having
bought an additional 100 shares, for a total of 183.
[were they even where they needed to be] </p> [and did they say anything that we could discover?]
[did they say something interesting] <p> [something that was useful in some way]     

anyway. I don't know what to do about. Javascript. and my OHLC estimator. I think that I spent so much time 
just trying to make it draw. that. well. like. and the drawing part. the visual part of it. is probably the least useful aspect of the 
thing. I have a project due tomorrow. One issue that I'm having is that I really don't have all that much energy, except on those days 
where I'm consuming an elevated amount of caffeine.

[] things could have gone well, they could have been amazing they could have been nice <p> [but that was not the way they worked out]
The order that says: <i>Sell to Open ... Put</i>, is an attempt to enter SPLG, 100 shares at 49.90, but more specifically, it's the closing
transaction of an OTO pair where, I think I sold those shares at 50.20. I did it as a <i>sell to open 1 put option</i>, rather than a 
[] some of how they went was less than where they were [] <i>limit buy 100 shares </i> [] you told me that it was all my fault and that
because there is something I'm trying to see. I wouldn't ordinarily do it this way, but, like I said, there is something I'm trying to see. 
and there are a few reasons why I'm not too worried: <ul><li>I want those shares at 49.90 anyway because they're part of a closing transation</li>

[] I am responsible for the failures of everything, but it was not my fault. 
at least, not in my opinion. I think that [you are the one responsible, and you are the one]
[who did all the wrong things and that you are the one who made all the mistakes and you are the one who fucked everything up]
<li>The expiration date is 2 days out, so, I'm not locked in to the contract for a nightmarishly long time
<li>Plus, there is something I'm trying to see</li>
</li> [you fucked everything up, but primarly for your own self that's what it was] </ul>
[if it turned out that things were not so amazing then] </p> [maybe it was not the way we thought it would go]

[there was something useless in the water] <p>What else: I had 19 buy orders filled, and no sell orders filled.</p>

<p>I think that most of these buy orders are closing transactions to sell orders. In the grand scheme of things,
SPLG is a long term position for me, and I'm only day trading a handful of shares at any given time. [not amazing!]

[but there was an amazing thing] <p>Anyway, in all honestly, in some ways. I'd rather just be working right now,

and, well -- you know what else I saw?
I saw a number of other very interesting things.
things that would interest an interested person.

<p>so I used a table. I know that I should be using a flex box or something.</p>
<p>Anyway. I don't know how to describe this the correct terminology, but I'm going to stagger my orders outside of the range by 5 cents.

<br>so: <br><br>50.74 - 50.95
<br>50.69 - 51.00

[they would be interesting to someone who was interested]
[but potentially boring to someone who was indifferent, or even, disinterested]

[well that's the way it goes] 12 I'm failing MIS 768. as in. I'm getting an F. I will have to audit
the course. an F is something that could take years to recover from
GPA wise. and when I mean recover, I simply mean having a GPA at a 
minimum acceptable level. a B average.

I really have no choice. I have to audit the course.
I also. have to file a patent.
and. yet again.
I. really. have no choice in the matter.

I think. one of the things that got me the
most interested in filing patents was. when I read
an article about the vanguard patent for the VTI ETF
being close to expiring. This was back in Missouri
when I was working at the hotel. I guess I finally
came around, four years later, to taking a detailed
look at the patent.

when I looked at the Vanguard VTI ETF patent, one thing
that immediately caught my eye was the section about the
patent application itself being under copyright protection,
and, when looking at other patent application files, not all
of them have that.
so I think.

I think I would file a copyright for the application material in
the patent application before submitting the patent application

918

[but there was something else] 11 . [hidden inside the place] . [where the 
people were] . I don't know how that last assignment went. It worked, I wanted to
spend more time with the comments, but I was one minute away from
the due date, and I had to just turn in what I had. I didn't even
want to really mess around with the code. I don't think that there 
was anything else for me to do. There was something that I wanted to
do. Oh, it was to remove the resource leak warnings, I remember, they
weren't errors, just warnings from the IDE that I usually do something
about, but I figured I didn't want to risk messing anything up.

919

[it was something new] . something interesting 
[a kind of orange inside of a lemon] . [an egg inside
of another egg] . [it was something new where the old things became new] 

920

[how they were] 10 what a nightmare! i just finished my last class exercise 
of week 5 [well. I am failing MIS 768 and it seems that is the way it's going]
and it took me 8 hours to complete. and i still have an individual
assignment due, and usually these are more complex. I don't even
want to imagine how many millions of years this individual assignment
is going to take, and, I still think that I'm going to be behind.
I don't even want to think about how many millions of billions and
eternities this assignment is going to take.

921

When I first signed up for this class, I think that I wanted to
eventually convert some of whatever Java assignments I anticipated
completing into JavaScript files, and then displaying them here
on my landing page, but I just haven't come around to doing that.

from readme.md entry # 8
So today I learned that I actually can edit .md files in
Eclipse. I have to use a - there is something called a generic 
text editor. I'm writing this in eclipse.

922

So basically, I moved the location of my local GitHub repository. 
I moved it from my lap-top hard drive to my
external hard drive.

923

So this update is being written in Eclipse, I had to change
the readme file from a .md to a .txt. It might be possible
to edit a .md file in eclipse, but for whatever reason, it wasn't 
readily apparent to me how to do so.

924

For whatever reason I can't edit a .md file in eclipse.

925

I moved the location where I keep my local GitHub files. 
I'm going to commit this and see if this worked out.

926

I'm really tired right now.
[how many times have I told you]
[not to eat oranges without me > + ? ] [and yet how often do you do it anyway]

927

i have to use a different IDE
so workspace save interval in minutes. I think setting it from 5 to 1. 
from five minutes to 1 minutes is essentially the same as auto-save. right?

928

let's put it this way
i haven't even started
and i'm already lost

there was a reading that i kind of missed

Oracle. (1995). Documentation: The Java™ Tutorials - 
Object-Oriented Programming Concepts. Retrieved from 
[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/index.html]
[we are going to have a competition] [] [there will be winners]

929

i remember downloading a modding
program for empire total war
and it was hosted on github
it can actually  mod any total war game

what was it. well, i don't remember it
having a landing page
and all the details were
right there on the github repository
so i guess i don't really need a landing page
for every repository

but it was a convention established
in the first programming course i took
so i think i'll continue to do it.

930

I don't even know where to begin.
I'm setting up a landing page for this repository

yeah, i honestly don't even know where to begin
i think that i might get caught up
or
I might get tied down creating
this landing page.

it's kind of nice to type with a keyboard
again. i've been using speech to text
for a while.

<br><br>With that in mind I'm going to abandon formatting it in this new way.

<p> I think I'm going to switch to a single line display. I had 10 buy orders filled, and 19 sell orders filled. Once Again: The goal
is to have an equal number of buy and sell orders filled on any given day. Is there something that I should be doing right now?

well, obviosuly there is something that I need to be doing, there are several things that I need to be doing, and that I need to get done, 
but where do I start? Which one of these tasks do I start with?</p>
<p> Well, I don't exactly know what to do. I'll take the previous day's estimate and start There

<br><br>Estimate for 10/17/2023

</p> [it's an experimental writing style it's something. it's you know it's experimental]
<p>I'm honestly total lost on this. Like I really don't know what to do next, at this point. I'm thinking that something is going to happen
in either direction, but. I have really no idea what. When I look at the weekly chart, I'm thinking that the bars will head toward
the upper band, and when I look at the daily chart, I'm thinking that the bars will head toward the lower band. A red daily bar for tomorrow would
not turn the weekly bar red, because, well, it's only Wednesday. Right? Anyway, usually the Bollinger Bands widen after they've been narrow for a while
so, something has to happen, up or down, in order for them to widen, and statistically speaking, it's more likley that whatever it is, it's going to 
be within the bands, and in this case, that would mean a downward bar, or a red bar or whatever. Right? I'm going to revise my estimate:

[but there was something about] <br><br>Revised Estimate for 10/18/2023 
<br><br>Range: .66 [the discussion that wasn't really clear to me]
<br>Trend: None [there was something that wasn't really clear to me]

<br>O/C: Open Higher than Close. [how everything is such a nightmare]
[for me, it don't know, it's basically over] </p> [how everything is such a nightmare.]

<p>The other possibility is that it skids upward along the top band on the daily chart. I'm going to revise my estimate again.

<br><br>Revised Estimate for 10/18/2023 
<br><br>Range: .68

<br>O/C: Open Higher than Close.
[one of the things is that] </p> [there wasn't anything that I could do at that point.]
[ when the trade of goods increases on both sides]
<p> Well, I'm going to place my orders. Since I think that bands are going to widen, I'm going to move my orders outward, rather than inward. or away from  

the midpoint rather than toward the midpoint.

[to all of those beans!]
<p>So. What am I thinking right now? Well. I have no idea. The time is actually 21:35, two hours after creating the heading
for this post. I have a homework assignment that I really haven't even looked at. and I need to look at it, and, I actually 
need to turn it in. Tomorrow I think.</p> 
<p>Today is now already the 17th. It's really amazing how quickly time passes.</p>

<p> Okay, where to start? I didn't have a single dime of overlap. The day range for SPLG was 50.99 - 51.40, and my estimate was
50.20 to 50.83. So let's try again. Let's review how the day went. I had five buy orders filled and nine sell orders filled.
</p>

<p>the goal is to have an equal number of sell orders and buy orders filled. on any given day. Looking at Friday, I bought 7 more shares than I sold, 
today I sold 4 more shares than I bought.
[I think that even if you are failing in a major way] </p> [people still want to see you fail in a major way. again.]

<p>So, where to start? Well, and ADX of 17.50 suggests that there is no trend. So I'm estimating that tomorrow being a down day
is equally likely as tomorrow being an up day. I need to come up with something a little more precise, but, like how? Next, I'm estimating That
the day range will be .60 based on a 20 day ATR of, well, .60, so. HA! Next: I'm estimating that SPLG will open higher than it closes, this is 
because she shorter time lines, the 60 minute charts are  near the top of the upper Bollinger Band. So where am I at?

<br><br>Range: .60 
<br>Trend: None 
<br>Midpoint: 51.20
<br>Range: 50.90 - 51.50

<br>O/C: Open Higher than Close. [you have to hide - it's a dark forest out there - you have to hide - people want to see you fail]

</p> <p>Where did my vape go? Anway, I guess that's it for this post. I have to think if there is anything else I need to do today.</p>

<p class= "adventuretitle" >Adventure # 12 - 10/16/2023 12:53</p>

<p>What am I thinking about right now? well, I'm writing this at 0314, so, several hours after when I first started this post. It's Monday,
and I'm not sure what I really need to do. It's the middle of the month already. what a nightmare. The vehicle registration stuff is done,
but was that all I managed to do yestereday?</p> <p>How did the smog check stuff go? well, the first place I went to was not even really
a smog check location, i thought it was, but, it was actually a car wash. This is a gas station near the grocery store, I always thought that 
it had a smog check station attached to it, but it was just a car wash, not a smog check. so then i just decided that I would pick a place 
on Google Maps that's listed as a smog check location. I went there, and it was closed. so then I went to the next location listed on Google Maps.
and then I went home and renewed my vehicle registration.
</p><p>A lot of things can go wrong between now, and the Fall Semester of 2024, in fact, a lot of things can go wrong between now and the 
<i>Spring</i> Semester of 2024.</p>

<p>Okay. what was I expecting SPLG to be at today? because it looks like I'm already wrong. On Saturday I wrote: 
"My best guess is that SPLG will be between 50.20 and 50.83" Well, There's really not telling if I'm already wrong. Friday was my first
time estimating an OHLC bar, so, I have to see how today plays out. If the OHLC bar is something like 50.90 to 51.50, then, my estimate was way off, 
but an OHLC bar of 50.10 to 50.90 would be kind of in line with what I estimated.</p>
<p>...</p> [i don't really think it was ever really ideal to - you know - come out here - i don't think that it was the best idea]

[it's easy to say - oh well no i never wanted to see a person fail] <p>...</p> [but - people want to see you fail - that's how the world is]

[it's easy] <p> I need to get a smog check, and then I can renew my vehicle registration, my registration expired yesterday, so I had to pay
for a temporary moving permit. Headache. I was playing Rome Total War 2 earlier, but, the game froze so I had to force a restart, and 
at this point I'm no longer really in the mood to play that game.
[where maybe everything worked out well and maybe it was all amazing] </p>
<p>So I got all that vehicle registration stuff done. Smog Check and payment and all that. It was about 220 all together. 

It wasn't unexpected, but it was something I didn't really budget for. This is irritating because I don't really have
any money coming in. Getting paid out on my unemployment claim is almost hopeless at this point. What else do I need to do? Is there anything else
that I can do today? Is there anything else that needs to be done today?</p>

<p>I think about that scene in <i>The Fifth Element</i> where Zorg says:"Fire One-Million," and he's doing this in an effort to tame 
inflation, and firiing 
one-million is in contrast to firing five-hundred thousand. but. I think that if <i>The Fifth Element</i> were more "Space Odyssey" 
and Less "Star Wars"

Zorg would be increasing interest rates by one percent, in contrast to increasing interest rates by half a percent.
</p> <p>I also think that it's less likely that layoff notices would be sent out, and you know, instead it would be something like
Korben Dallas finding his 
workplace becoming a high-attrition environment.</p><p>I don't know how many times I've taken a job, only to find that the workplace is 
a high-attrition

environment. and then thinking: why did they hire me in the first place? they didn't really think I was going to tolerate this kind of
treatment, did they?
[but really it really is and it really is nice and easy] </p> [it's part of the thing that makes things easy]

941

<p>I'm trying to think about what to do about work, finding a job and all that. My expectation is that any kind of factory 
or warehouse work or any position at any company in a capital intensive business is going to be a high-attrition environment,
especially with interest rates as high as they are, a factory owner is better off firing everybody,

liquidating the factory, and investing that capital into bonds,
and will probably make more money doing so, especially with interest rates as high as they are.

and you wouldn't have to deal with the headache of running a business, just the headache of collecting interest payments.
</p> <p>Zorg: Fire one million, sell the cabs, shove the money into bonds, and collect the interest. Now that Korben Dallas
is no longer employed, he'll probably spend less money on Chinese Food, which should bring down the inflation rate on the Chinese food
portion of the consumer price index, which I don't think actually includes food.

</p> <p>I'm trying to figure out why it's always me that's the target of targeted attrition, like, do I really contribute all that much
to inflation? Like, increasing interest rates is supposed to motivate businesses to fire people, would you rather own a business, and collect 
profits, or would you rather own bonds,

and collect interest? the correct answer is: whatever pays more. so when bonds pay more than businesses, you shift money from businesses 
to bonds, firing people in the process,
and when people get fired, they have

less money to spend, and when they have less money to spend, prices increase at a slower rate, and that means inflation slows down. but, i don't 
spend that much money to begin with, so, me. being employed. doesn't really contribute to inflation. so don't target me for attrition, Zorg, other
people contribute more to inflation than I do. other people should get targeted for attrition. not me. 
</p> <p>but, um, yeah. things are kind of difficult right now, and, kind of a nightmare.</p>

<p>One of my classmates asked me for help on an older project that she was catching up on. I sent her a link to my GitHub link to that particularl
project, but realized that she might not be using GitHub yet. So I created a CodePen version of project 10 created specificially for Codepen. I created
a Project 10 for display on CodePen, but that was just the GitHub version iframed into CodePen, but for the new project 10 version in codepen, I cloned
the actual code from GitHub and put it into a CodePen Pen, it didn't work at first, so I had to change the iframe slider to reference my older Codepen Project Specifically.
angry. irritated - annoyed these things I really don't even know what to say about this </p>

<p>I'm not sure if that's really well explained, but, things are referenced differently in CodePen such that, it really doesn't 
work well unless I use absolute references, and in many cases, not all references work well.

<p>So, I just need to focus on getting through the course that I'm already taking. This turned out to be a really good
program and I'm really pleased that I decided to take it. So, for UNLV, I have to take a calculus class for the Spring 2024 Semester,
which I'm thinking is going to be the second semester calculus class, since I had taken the first semester of calculus several
years ago. I have to get a B in that class. I'm wanting, and I'm hoping that I can take this class online.

i didn't exactly state the obvious but I did state that things are not going well </p>
and yet, the store ran out of egg-nog anyway? <p>...</p> I do not understand what is wrong with their ERP SYSTEM!
<p class= "adventuretitle" >Adventure # 7 - 10/13/2023 12:28</p> [] WHERE THE FUCK IS THE EGG-NOG!

[] I decided to start a new life as a <p> petals on a - here we are
I found it again, i discovered what was already previously
known to the whole of the universe, but I found it again.

Alright, so what are we looking at here, um SPLG. it's almost 4:00 PM Eastern Time, 
so I guess this is basically what happened today. A total of 13 of my limit buys were 
excecuted, and a total of 4 of my limit sell orders were excecuted, so I ended up buying 7 more shares than I sold.
<br>
<p> This isn't a big deal or anything because SPLG is a long term position for me, and I'm always happy to have more
shares of SPLG, but that not really what I'm trying to accomplish here.</p>
<p>The goal is to end the day with the same number of shares bought as shares sold. so any time I have too many
extra shares bought or too many extra shares sold, then that means I didn't predict the trading range for that day correctly.
</p>
    
951    
    
[but there were things that were more interesting than the things that were amazing] </p>
<img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 123333.png" alt="Stock Charge of Ticker Symbol SPLG">
<br> [things that were really amazing. and were totally amazing.] <br>
<img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 123807.png" alt="Trades Place for Ticker Symbol SPLG">

<p>Okay, so let's try again for Monday. My best guess is that SPLG will be between 50.20 and 50.83, see chart below.</p> 
<img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 130204.png" alt="Stock Charge of Ticker Symbol SPLG">
<p>I'll place 2 orders, one in each direction.</p>
<img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 130723.png" alt="Trades Place for Ticker Symbol SPLG">

<p>So we will see how that goes. The goal for tomorrow is to have two shares bought, and two shares sold. Or, well, since I have so many 
outstanding orders at this point, to have the same number of buy orders excecuted as sell orders.</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason why I'm only doing 1 share at a time, usually I do 10, is because I really screwed up on 10/05/2023 and sold about 

70 more shares than I bought, which really threw everything off. In the following days I ended up selling 207 more shares than I wanted 
to, so I'm at the point of, you know, I basically gotta keep this at 1 share at a time until I'm back at my goal of getting those 207 
shares back, and, even though I accumulated 7 more shares than I wanted too today, that accumulation really doesn't count because I want 
those 207 shares back at 49.90, and not higher.</p>

<p>and 49.90 is still, you know, in the realm of possibility, in fact, I couldn't find a reason to buy back in at higher than 49.90, even
after 4 green days because, at no point did there seem to be confirmation of a trend change, or, at least I don't seem to see anything. 
Maybe if it hit above 51.66, but, I probably still would have waited out even if it did hit 51.66.
[i don't really know well, you know. i don't really know] </p> [there was something there - well it was not really there]

<img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 133205.png" alt="Stock Charge of Ticker Symbol SPLG">
<p>Anyway, that last chart was a lot to look at. I went to UNLV today to have the meeting with the MSQF Program Director. 
From the conversation it seems clear that I won't be admitted to the program for the Spring Semester of 2024, I could 
go to UNLV for Spring 2024, but, only to take a prerequisite course. and then I can get into the program for Fall 2024. 
This is one of those times where I really hope that I can take this course online. </p> [] I don't know what the hell to do about that []

<p>Otherwise than that, I'm really tired. I'm worried though. The reason I was shooting for a Spring 2024 admission is because
there are so many things can go wrong between now and January, and, there are even more things that can go wrong between now and August 2024.
you know, and, this is just another nightmare.

952

[well, and, there was something going on there there was really something interesting] </p> [i don't]
<div> [one of those things was. well. you know. it wasn't what i anticipated it would be] <p> these []

[there were things out there that were interesting] <p>...</p> [] it might be something somewhere []
<p class= "adventuretitle" >Adventure # 6 - 10/12/2023 20:47</p><p> in [] in the future something that goes on

I am exhausted. I have a meeting tomorrow regarding admission to UNLV. I have to figure this out. It's not
clear to me what we will be discussing. I don't know how many times I've sent transcripts and submitted
applications to UNLV, and all that. [] later but who really know who really thinks about that [] well

I don't know what's on my mind exactly. I'm tired. Going back to work for those two weeks or whatever. It made
me realize that. I don't know. Like. Working in a factory or a warehouse is going to be just another dead end.
It's never really gone anywhere, and, as far as I can tell, it's not really going to go anywhere.

I remember going into one interview recently and, there was this kind of weird moment where, the interviewer
seemed to. Well, she stated that she was looking for someone who was looking to stay with the organization for
the next 20 years or something. and I was thinking. I was thinking later, but. do I really plan 20 years ahead?
do I have a 20 year plan? because I already know that I don't have a 20 year plan, but if I did have a 20 year plan
or, something. I sure as hell wouldn't be interviewing for your company. [] you said that these were interesting []

953

you know. [] they were in fact more boring that I could have ever imagined [she had this distinct flavor]
[] it was something akin to [] and well [i don't really want to go into details]
and they say [] well that a true gentelman never [] will never kiss and tell, but I did not kiss her!
[i tasted her! her punani! and it had a distict flavor!] 

if I have to plan for the next 20 years, the most obvious thing to do is not to work for some company that I don't
see myself working at for 20 years. you know. like I don't really see myself working there for 20 years, or even 2 years.

You know. There isn't a single company that I've ever worked for, or that I've ever applied for, that I really saw myself
working at for 20 years. [] how would i discribe the flavor? it was something like [] well it was something akin to [] well

I mean the most obvious thing to do, if I'm planning for the next 20 years. is. to go back to college. develop some
new skill or whatever. you know [] it had a distinct flavor. [I am not able to put into words exactly what the flavor could]
be compared to but was - shall i compare they punani to summer's eve! it was douche flavored punani! THATS! WHAT IT WAS!

So what am I thinking about right now. I got sidetracked from putting down my thoughts for Adventure # 4. Well.
I don't know. I tend to be bombarded with stuff. Various stuffs. Various things. This or that. Whatever. I started
obsessing over the color of the buttons on my landing page. made a little bit of progress. realized I don't know
jack about javascript. figured I'd get around to it later. and then I started 
obsessing over my project carousel. so that's basically what happened. I'm tying to recollect about what happend 
yesterday, and the things I'm thinking about for the next couple days. The forseeable future, which as of right now.
can be measured only. in days.

955

I got sidetracked yet again. I don't know where I was.

Quam pulchra es sicut ibi stabat Qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet consectetur 
ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem Quae te dementia cepit Forsan et 
haec olim meminisse juvabit Militat omnis amans  omnia vincit amor  

I got sidetracked yet again. The above text should read something like 
How beautiful you are standing there! who gullibly believes you are everything? who seeks pain to derive some pleasure from pain? What madness
posesses you? We will remember this fondly: every lover is a fighter: Love conquers all.

This is basically just a collage of different latin quotes. Famous ones. including the most famous latin text of all: 

lorem ipsum.

This is supposed to be funny. The most famous latin quote should be omnia vincit amor, love conquers all, but I don't think that it is, i mean, more
well known than lorem ipsum. the other funny thing is that, delorem ipsum, is from, i guess, cicero, but his most famous line should actually be:

Carthago delenda est

956

and um, I guess I came across: Militat omnis amans, from Ovid
which translates to: every lover is a fighter
<br>
<br>every lover
<br><i>is</i>
<br>a fighter
<br><br>
Which is really funny because that's clearly a response to the phrase: "I'm a lover not a fighter." 
and he does this to omnia vincent amore as well, where he say something like:

957

Love conquers all? so too will I triumph over love!

but I couldn't find that quote online, or at least, 
I had a lot of trouble finding it because all searches for

Omnia vincent amore, ovid come up only with virgils original line.

anyway.

I got sidetracked again, I had an ititial version of project 8 that I was having a lot of trouble with, so, I stopped working on it and
started completely over. There is a screenshot of it in my media folder. I don't know what the issue was. or. I don't remember since project 8
feels like it was something I did such a long time ago, but whatever it was. I think it was that I was having trouble changing things. so I started with
a different templete or whatever it's called in wordpress, and deleted more or less everything but the color scheme, and re-did the entire
thing element by element. so. that's how it went. super easy and I really enjoyed it.


I feel like there was something I'm supposed to do today, but, whatever it is, it's clearly slipped my mind. <br><br>

This is probably going to be the least user friendly blog ever. Tell me: are you reading this? Is it nice and user friendly?
because I'm not sure I really care, you're basically reading my diary. Whether or not it's user friendly isn't really my problem.
One of the issues I have with what I post on chestnutandhazel.com is that It's hosted, or whatever, it's really just an account
on blogger.com, so since it's basically a social media account, I have to comply with the community guidles of blogger.com, and
since I have adsense active on that page, I also have to comply with any adsense advertiser standards, so I have my hands tied 
in many respects. chestnutandhazel.com continues to get flagged over and over and over, and in many cases I don't really want to 
deal with it right away.

the other issue is that I also have to post what I write somewhere, so that I can use the standard copyright registration form,
rather than the unpublished copyright registration form, so, that's another issue. so you know, it's kind of whatever.

This is a photograph of a mixed media composition. I took two paintings that I bought by a local artist, put a Zoloft pen

The paintings are by Vanessa Callanta. what stood out to me about Callanta's Painting "All Work and No Play" was how

I know you want a man with such a substantial weiner
but what's so amazing about really substantial weiners?
I know that his weiner is more substantial than mine.

but what substance is there to having such a substantial 
weiner? and what does it matter outside of the context of 
a weiner measuring contest? really? why does it matter?

You are such a queef queen any way scented like roses and
the smell the vaginal gasses that your punani produces!
everyone knows that miss queef queen is in the room! there 

is something in the air and if it's not the liquid come
shots then it must not be the liquid come kingdom come and 
then you said something nasty about how things turn around 

when you least expect them to, but what could a slender 
weiner do for you when you have such a substantial booty?
you must need a substantial weiner to satisfy you! well 

guess what! i could substantiate that I now have a more 
substantial weiner than I did before. It is more glorious 
that anything you have ever been familar with and more amazing too

way more amazing and it has a flavor. a very distinct flavor!
I promise that you will not be disappointed with the amazing
with the amazing flavor profile of what you must know is amazing!

  I'm more tired than ever. More than I can possibly imagine. Today was a long day. Small victories I guess.
  </p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p class= "adventuretitle" >Adventure # 1 - 10/10/2023 10:48</p>
  
  <p>  
  I consider this published, even if it's unlikley anyone will come across this
  or read it. There are times when I want to write things, but, less and less I feel
  the desire to write them on chestnutandhazel.com I don't know what it is, but, I'm
  starting to feel more "On Stage" when I write and post things there.
  
  Maybe a few years back it seemed, it felt like there wasn't anyone really, you know
  reading it.
  
  I need to be working on Project 11, but for some reason I'm just not really getting anything done.
  I've managed to figure out where my Contact Form is. It's something that I haven't really messed with
  in a while, but Project 11 entails messing with it. So. That's what I'm up to.
  
  There's a lot of cleaning up that needs to be done with the index page of my Github Repository,
  and a lot of that cleaning up, with the code, cleaning up the appearance of my code wouldn't
  really change the outward appearance of my page. It would just make it easier to change things around
  but, considering that the course is almost over, I'm not really sure how much it makes sense to really
  do anything about it.
  
  I really have to get Project 11 done. I was reviewing the recording of the class session, and
  it looks easy, and, I remember it being easy when I was doing it. I don't remember, but I 
  think that I napped through part of the class, and came back around to it later.
  
  One of the things about the class is that, I'm much more open to distance learning, or online coursework, or virtual classrooms,
  or whatever, now that I've done it, back in 2018 or 2019 I think that I was really skeptical about it, and
  I kind of brushed off a recruiter for an online degree program, but um, I think that I'm more open to it now.
  
  I tried to get the favicon to work on GitHub, but, I can't seem to figure it out, and, since it's not an assignment,
  I really didn't pursue the thing past the point of absolute frustration.
  
  The favicon is more vanity than any kind of practical kind of a thing. Like I don't have a practical reason for setting 
  up the favicon on GitHub other than the desire to have one.
  
  I'm exhausted, and I really haven't done anything for project 11 yet.
  I want to take a nap, but, that's a little bit of a risk considering that it's due today.
  and, I really have to get to it because, in all probability, it's something that can be done in an hour or two, at most.
  I'm so tired. I want to get a soda.
  
           
           
           
           
  
  
I don't know what to do about CodePen. Migrating things to github is a small nightmare.
           

  
  I'm feeling incredibly scatter brained. I have a project due for my software and web development course today, and I haven't even started. 
  This should be simple, so I'm not too worried about it, but, at the same time, I know from the past that these things could take quite 
  a while if I hit a brick wall.
  
  There are other issues that I'm facing, especially on the income front. The temp assignment was not a particularly good fit, and, I 
  really get the feeling that I should avoid any kind of warehouse or factory work, even though, that's sort of what I've been doing 
  for the past five years, but I don't have the slightest clue what to look for.
  
  Life is such an unbelievable struggle. I don't really know what to do about money. Somewhere in the back of my mind there's 
  this voice telling me that I should stop looking for a job or employment or whatever, and, that I should focus on trying to 
  make money doing stock market shit.

  Reflection # 714 by Chestnut and Hazel
  I don't know exactly what I've been spending on buying lunch and soda at work, 
  but I know that it is too damn much, I want to say it is around 15 dollars per day. 
  Too fucking much. I have to cut down on that for sure.
  By Chestnut + Hazel at June 11, 2019 
  
  Notes written on 10/10/2023 @ 10:19 AM
  
  I think that I wrote this post while I was working at Case New Holland. I'm surprised that I was really spending that much. I 
  Wonder what I was buying? I don't really remember. I think that it was mostly energy drinks. I don't remember my exact hours. 
  It was overnight is as much as I remember. In Cameron, MO there isn't really much to eat if you're up at odd hours.
  
  I'm working on Project 11 for my Web and Software Development course. I'm not really getting much done. I'm getting sidetracked
  with other things. I'm really amazed that I get so little done, especially considering that I've had few other obligations other
  than class these past few months. I really wonder what I've been doing.
  
  Earlier in the course I would have a lot of fun playing around with our daily assignments, but, I haven't really done that in a
  while, even though there have been plenty of opportunities to do so.

  "Clothes 28" by Kenneth Larot Yamat By Chestnut ﹠ Hazel at 
  January 19, 2019 originally posted at chestnutandhazel.com
  
  I watched two documentaries.
  One on the Sino Japanese war.
  The one that morphed into world
  War 2. And one on the Japanese
  Industrial revolution.
  
  So. I wanted to think about why
  Things ended at the OTA. It's been
  A while. And I think. Deserves some
  Reflection.
  
  Lets say that all decisions can be
  Simplified. That all decisions
  Come to a fork. Bifurcate or
  Whatever. Like. You are faced
  With a decision. And your choices
  Are always two. At first.
  
  Think of this. In a standard road.
  You have two choices when you
  Reach an intersection. You can
  Continue down the road. Or turn.
  Two choices. If you choose to
  Turn. You can choose left or right.
  Two choices. And so on. Some
  Might think of this as three choices.
  You can travel straight. Left. Or right.
  But you can also think of it the way
  I did. Of two choices. One choice
  Having two sub choices.
  
  Which way of thinking is more
  Simple? Which way of thinking is
  Less convoluted? Which way of
  Thinking is cleaner. I have no idea.
  But I think. That bifurcation allows
  Points in the decision making
  Process to be more clearly marked.
  And either way. You can still account
  For all possible decisions.
  
  So back to my former boss at the
  OTA. She could have extended me.
  Or she could have decided not to
  Extend me. We already know what
  Decision she made. But let's figure
  Out what she was thinking.
  
  Now. It didn't bother me that I wasn't
  Formally employed by the OTA.
  Who cares right? Some people do
  Though. Some people do like to
  Be official or whatever.
  
  And I'm not being dismissive
  About the desire to be official.
  I wanted to be official with Ash.
  But she didn't want to be official
  Unless we were super fucking
  Official.
  
  In my thinking though. Even when a
  Person is formally employed. Their
  Continued employment is really
  Just an extension. It just goes by
  A different term. People think of
  It differently. But I don't. People
  Think of it differently because
  Different words are used. But I'd say
  The mechanics of being a contractor
  On an extension basis. And being
  A formal employee whose
  Performance is measured at
  Regular intervals. It's the same
  Thing. If you aren't handed a pink
  Slip when you show up for work.
  You have been extended. Haha.
  
  So she could have extended me.
  Or not extended me. If she extended
  Me. I don't know what would
  Happen. Would she have to buy
  My contract from the staffing
  Agency? And pay some kind
  Of a premium to do so? I have no
  Idea.
  
  I don't know what the extension
  Decisions would be. If she would
  Have been forced to decide whether
  Or not to keep me on a contract
  Basis indefinitely. Or decide to
  Make me a formal employee of the
  OTA. I have no idea. Really no idea.
  
  And maybe that is where the issue
  Arose. Maybe the issue was that
  She had to decide whether or not
  To formalize my employment or
  Not. She may have wanted to
  Extend. But could not formalize
  My employment for whatever
  Reason. And maybe formalizing
  Was the only way to extend.
  
  So basically. Maybe she wanted to
  Extend. But not formalize. Since
  She could not extend without
  Formalizing. She therefore could
  Not extend. So she decided not
  To extend. And maybe that was it.

<p> What Do You Think About Butter?<br>
By Chestnut + Hazel at October 22, 2022 <br>
<br>
These are the things I think
about when I think about 
butter: well, first and foremost
butter is not what makes the
world go round. Something.
some kind of force makes
the world go round, and I 
think that the force in question
would be called momentum,
or maybe it would be called 
inertia, but whatever the force
is called, I doubt that it
is called butter, and therefore!
when people ask what force
makes the world go round
just be aware that butter is 
not the answer to that question!</p>

<p>I remember this event. This was when I first moved to Cameron, Missouri.
  I remember that I was working at a State Prison in the town, and I remember
  that the training center for this role was in a larger city, still a small city,
  St. Joseph, not too far away. I got into a car crash on the highway into St. Joseph.
  My car was a total loss as a result of the crash. It would be 8 months later before I could
  get another car.

<p> I don't know what to do about chestnutandhazel.com and some of

  when renewal comes up in Januray, and, I don't know, once again I'm not really making enough 
  money from my business for it to make sense for me to do so. so there we go. In january, I will no longer 
  have a business address.

I didn't go to bunriths funeral. not because i didn't care to go or because i thought that i
had more important things to do. but. the issue was that i didn't want to go back
to the bay area. i was fucking homeless my last few months there, and even though
i don't feel like my life was totally bad during those months of homelessness. i just
harbored a hell of a lot of resentment for the way that things went.

Hi,

Starting your own business can be tremendously rewarding, but as any 
entrepreneur knows, you must overcome a lot of fear and uncertainty in 
order to be successful.

Is it possible for me to submit an article on your website that gives 
advice to prospective entrepreneurs on how to overcome the fear of 
beginning a new business?

Please let me know if you like this topic for your website, and I'll get 
started writing.

Thank you very much!

The main issues that are weighing on my mind right now are: getting into graduate school, paying for graduate school, paying back any student loans that I might accumulate while attending graduate school, completing graduate school without running out of cash and credit, and then finding employment sufficiently remunerative such that any student loans I have to pay back aren't excessively burdensome.

* * *

Even though I might be getting distracted. Or at least I feel like I'm getting distracted. It's possible that I'm getting more done than I think. What is one thing that I would like to get done? Well, complete another Copyright Registration. The issue here isn't time. It's money. I'm already stretched super thin in terms of money, and I really don't have any money to spend on pet projects, but in a way, when I say that, I know that I've spent more on lunches than. You know. Impulse purchases are issues too. you know. and I'm wasting money in one area or another, that should be better used in some other area.

* * *

This is probably a useless thing to point out, but I have a folder for links that I have used in the past, but, don't plan on using anytime soon, they may be specific in some way, like, a specific facebook page. I might not. i obviously don't need to bookmark facebook, but there may be a specific facebook page that i might want to book mark. anyway. i have a specific bookmarks folder for bookmarks that are kind of like that. super specific pages in. anyway. the situation there is that I had folders within my archived bookmark folders. i fixed that issue of having folders within my archived bookmarks folder for bookmarks of pages within websites that i want to bookmark, but the main website doesn't need to be bookmarked. stupid trivial issue.

* * *

Fuck. Let me think for a minute. Incessant distractions. There was something that I was thinking about. Okay. it's about the wash loss rule regarding stock trading. I wouldn't be worrying about this right now, however, I basically did not get. My unemployment insurance claim was not approved, or, disqualified, so I'm basically selling the shares I have in my Robinhood account to cover my current needs, and this also wouldn't be an issue, however, the current market prices of the shares I'm selling are below my cost-basis for the shares that I'm selling.

So I'm selling my fucking shares at a realized loss, and this has the potential to cause me to run afoul of the wash-sale rule in the event that I'm not realizing my capital losses correctly.

You know. There's a fucking correct way to lose money and shit. what a fucking nightmare.

* * *

I'm trying to think about something. Well. It may have been possible that my. that the money I spent on the Meningitis Vaccine for college, would have been paid for by my employer health plan, but I'm not sure.

* * *

What do I need to work on? Okay. I got distracted again. Transcribing notes. working on stuff for my twitter profile. I just can't believe how much time I've been spending on there. There was an Automated Profile, or an Automated Bot Re-Tweeter that caught my attention, and I found it interesting. I ended up experimenting with emojis for a while.

Let's think about this. my life is difficult right now. as far as i can tell, my income is going to be only slightly above my living expenses. i also don't anticipate my life getting easier. my life has never become easier. it's only ever become more difficult.

my expected income for the next 12 months is only slightly higher than my expected expenses for the same time period.

to me, this means the next 12 months are going to be a total fucking waste of time.

unless I get accepted, admitted, and enrolled at UTA, and complete the program, and get the degree.

fucking nightmare.

* * *

Oh, I actually didn't use the word admitted incorrectly. I used the phrase "accepted, but never attended" so. I didn't use the word "admitted" incorrectly, because i didn't use the word "admitted"

I fucking hate quotation marks.

anyway, maybe I used admitted in my educational objectives essay incorrectly. I'm not going to worry about it right now.

Review and Research Options for a

Let me think. Okay. another thing. I'm not going to worry about electives right now. I'll figure that out later as well.

    - Electives: Spanish
    - Electives: Mathematics
            - Data Science
            - Statistics
            - Insurance
            - Accounting
    - Electives: Programming
            - Information Systems
            - Industrial & Manufacturing Systems
            - Computer Science
            - Communications Technology
            - Business Analytics
    - Electives: Finance Outside of Finance 
            - Urban Design
            - Real Estate
            - Landscape Architecture
            - Interior Design
            - Insurance
            - Architecture
            - Economics
            - City & Regional Planning

* * *

So I guess I've been using the word admitted incorrectly. Idiot. Anyway. I uploaded this email from UNLV to be included in my UTA application, and this might be the end of the application process. So. Yeah, I don't really know what else to do right now. Let me think. From the context of the situation, acceptance is a kind of invitation to enroll. i guess. and admitted is when you're in. so accepted and admitted are two different things. idiot.

well. yeah. i guess i can butt hurt for a few hours.

"To Whom It May Concern: Kenneth Yamat (DoB: 08/14/1987) is not and has never been an admitted student of University of Nevada Las Vegas. The student admissions application was cancelled. As of this date, the student has never enrolled or attended any classes at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The student has not earned any college credit at the university. If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me."

* * *

Anyway. I figured out how to deal with that issue. I just created a filter so that they never show up in my mailbox again.

* * *

My life is just too difficult right now for me to do anything other than hang tight and see what happens next. I can't do anything. I can't do anything like start a company, or anything like that.

* * *

I got another email from Viator, Inc. requesting that I update this or that to comply with new legal requirements or whatever, but this only applies to people who own a tour company, and I don't own a tour company, so it doesn't apply to me.

I thought briefly about starting one, but I just don't see how this would work, so I won't be starting one.

* * *

The only thing that makes sense for me to do right now is wait until UTA makes a decision on my application. There's really nothing else that I can do, and no other course of action really makes any sense what so ever.

* * *

My life is difficult right now. Everything is more or less on pause until thing get easier, and they more or less never get easier.

I didn't go to bunriths funeral. not because i didn't care to go or because i thought that i
had more important things to do. but. the issue was that i didn't want to go back
to the bay area. i was fucking homeless my last few months there, and even though
i don't feel like my life was totally bad during those months of homelessness. i just
harbored a hell of a lot of resentment for the way that things went.

Hi,

Starting your own business can be tremendously rewarding, but as any 
entrepreneur knows, you must overcome a lot of fear and uncertainty in 
order to be successful.

Is it possible for me to submit an article on your website that gives 
advice to prospective entrepreneurs on how to overcome the fear of 
beginning a new business?

Please let me know if you like this topic for your website, and I'll get 
started writing.

Thank you very much!

I'm taking this off my list because i think it's good to go. or i guess. i think my application is as complete as it's ever going to be, given the timetable, and if there is something fucked up, and i can't resolve it before the summer semester starts, then i'll just reapply for some other semester, like maybe the fall.

I want to write something flirtatious. i feel like she's flirting back. or maybe not, maybe just responding, but um.

i've been too.

i've been. i've

i don't know how to explain it.

i guess. i've imagined.

i don't know what the correct words are for this. 

sometimes i'll think that a woman is flirting with me, or is interested in me, and she really isn't.

* * *

I'm facing a challenge here. and I think I might know what the issue is. i think that i know what it is. and this is a pain in the ass.

I guess what I was suspecting, turned out not to be the case.

There is another possibility.

My thinking is that there is a scheduled transaction or a scheduled payment that I either did not account for, or accounted for incorrectly.

Well, I have a stop-gap measure. or. i figured a way to deal with it for the time being.

I just don't know what it is. I think that one account has more money in it than it should, which is the same amount that this other account seems to be short by.

I'll deal with it later. I mean. i deal with it more thoroughly later. Just eyeballing it, I think this to be the case.

So all those transfers are accounted for.

okay. i want to make a distinction between two things, there are pending transactions on the side of the remitter, and pending transactions on the side of the payee, i had to look up these terms.

there are pending transactions, and there are scheduled transactions, and there are pending transactions on the side of the payee, and pending transactions on the side of the remitter, then there are scheduled transactions on the side of the payee, and scheduled transactions on the part of the remitter.

one thing i want to also make a distinction about is that remitter in this case just refers to a person sending money in a general sense, i'm not using remitter to specifically refer to someone sending money, or a remittance, internationally.

There's something on my mind. Hum. I was really thirsty this morning. Um the other thing was that I want to reformat the top portion of my posts. The objects area.

* * *

There is something on my mind, that I'm really afraid about. I don't have any fucking friends. I'm actually afraid to make friends. I'm afraid of dating. I really am. I'm actually afraid of dating. I remember, sometimes there were people. sometimes there were women I would cross-paths with, and sometimes I would be interested in. or. maybe pursuing this woman or that woman. but i would always have these. i would always harbor these fears in the back of my mind. even when i didn't exactly have a whole hell of a lot. even when i wasn't harboring a whole hell of a lot on insecurities. fears really.

There are other things too. i'm afraid of everything. and. i don't know. there are fucking so many things going on right now.

i went on a short road trip. and it was more or less pointless.

Even though i sometimes. although i feel discouraged. sometimes. about how my life is going. i do remember taking an objective view of my life a while back. and. i did conclude that things are getting better for me. there are new difficulties that i've faced lately. and i want to say that. even though i've faced a hell of a lot of set backs recently. these set backs aren't as gigantic as set backs i've had before. i've had bigger set backs than the ones i've faced recently.

I just really hope that this is the end of the set backs, and that from here. i can begin progressing. i have been discouraged lately. i really have been.

What do I need to work on?

I'm trying to think. i think the reason that i get blocked. on twitter. is that if a person's tone is. i don't know. patronizing. or condescending. trivializing. or marginalizing. or snide or snarky. i'll usually adopt a similar tone. and it usually just pisses people off.

* * *

what the hell do I have to do? I have stay off twitter. I've only been blocked a hand full of times. I want to say three. I'm sure i've pissed everyone off. anyway. what i'm thinking about. going back to the completion of my graduate school application. is that. i am really fucking scared. i do have to take out student loans to get through school. and i know that i'll have to pay them back. This is really fucking scary. taking out student loans. and i'm not sure.

but i'm thinking that i really just need to be careful about it. going to graduate school is something that i've been wanting to do for a while. i might as well just do it, and take it as it comes.

* * *

There is a woman on twitter. who. i'm kind of trying to engage in dialogue with, but, i'm afraid that if i interact with her directly. and i say the wrong thing. she'll block me. i think that she's part of the UX debate. which i actually haven't really researched very much. i just sort of. post shit with the tag #UX, and say something.

* * *

I'm just trying to think.

Well, what are the possibilities? Um, there might be some administrative hang-up that might cause my application of fall through the cracks.

I realize something: I have to be slightly more realistic about what electives I sign up for.

And. Fucking. Twitter MILFs! I have to stay off there.

Twitter porn isn't any better than Instagram porn or anything else. but it's distracting.

* * *

Finally home. I can't believe I did that silly shit. Jesus. Thank God I'm home. Anyway. I'm going to stop reading the news for the foreseeable future.

* * *

I'm just so angry about everything. Really. I am. I went on a road trip today as kind of an elaborate joke, but, I mean. It wasn't that funny. I'm at this rest stop that I remember stopping at 4 years ago.

I'm angry. About everything. Everything irritates me and few things really ever make me happy anymore. I'm just so unhappy.

Maybe things will turn around. Maybe things will get more amazing, rather than more. Rather than more. I don't know. Everything sucks.

* * *

This a nightmare. a real nightmare. fuck. so what the hell do i do? this is really fucking disappointing. disappointing.

* * *

I never had a chance to really correspond with the person who wrote me that submissions email, regarding entrepreneurship and starting a business. i really. have no intention of ever starting a business. i guess. this. chestnut and hazel. chestnut + hazel. is a business. and i guess i started one, even if it has never been something that really ever made me any money. maybe it will make me money, but, it hasn't done so yet.

* * *

alright. so that's kind of nice. the data hotspot connection is working now.

* * *

There are a number of things that I just find kind of irritating. I only have 10 GB of hotspot data included in my monthly plan. included in my phone plan. usually, that's more than enough. in the past i was never really home to really use very much date, but this month, it turned out not to be enough. sucks. right now i just need a little more data, well, the month resets today, or it should have done so yesterday, but i'm still waiting. the slowed connection is enough for things that aren't really data heavy, like blogging. but more than that, and i'm really not able to access anything.

i feel like i'm in this constant state of making less money. that i'm always in this spiral of making less money, and having higher expenses, and things are just on the whole aren't really improving. i know that in many ways, things really are improving for me.

I don't know what I would have done differently if i could have gone back and done something differently.

    - (X) Credit Cards / payments scheduled

Employment
    - Internships
    - University Career Resources
    - Relocation Opportunities

I'm going to add these objectives to the education section. or move these or whatever, rather than have these a separate category.

* * *

I have a neighbor who tries to chat with me. or. maybe she chats at me. or talks at me. but she doesn't seem to be interested in talking with me. and what i mean is. she goes on and on about something, but when i try to talk with her. when i try to ask a question. or when i try to interject. or when i have something to say. she always replies that she can't hear me.

so my conclusion is. if she can't hear me, there is no point in me listening to her. we won't have a conversation if she can't hear me. if i listen to what she says. or if i don't listen to what she says. she's a broken record. as far as i can tell.

she talks to me. she doesn't. or she can't hear anything that i say when i respond. and she also can't see either. so when i try to write a response she says she can't see it.

so i'm thinking that. the only reason i should listen to her is if she expects to engage in a conversation, and if she doesn't expect to engage in a conversation. i might as well not listen to her. she only ever talks about useless stuff. conspiracies and stuff that, quite frankly, is essentially useless conversation topics.

* * *

I was able to compile all the posts for the indefinite hiatus series. it was short. just 62 posts in total. really short. i'll file a copyright in the morning. and then maybe i'll work on the innocuous posts series. i think about thinking about when. you try. i think about the times i want to look back at things. and how. looking back isn't really always a pleasant feeling.

i don't know why life isn't easier than it is. i really don't.

* * *

Salt. salt. i feel like garbage. i really feel like garbage. i'm really not feeling happy about anything.

* * *

I think I'm going to draft a kind of tactical plan of action or something. for. school. you know. as silly as that sounds.

* * *

I remember something from a while ago. a conversation i had with another guy when I was working at the book factory. he was obsessed with cryptocurrency. I never really ever got into cryptocurrency, and i felt like he was trying to get me into cryptocurrency, or trying to sell me on the idea of cryptocurrency, by mocking me for not being into cryptocurrency.

I feel like there is a sales tactic, and this sales tactic is something like: create in someone a sense of inadequacy, or indignity, or feelings of insecurity.

I felt like the whole idea was that, if i didn't know anything about cryptocurrency, than i was clearly an idiot.

* * *

I'm already feeling quite a bit of frustration getting all these posts together. Like really annoyed.

* * *

I'm working on compiling, consolidating, or amalgamating all of the posts in the indefinite hiatus series into a single document that. a single text document that i can submit for registration to the copyright office. some of these posts are taking forever to load.

* * *

I really don't like the way I look. am i a jerk for being cynical about that whole thing. i don't know. i'll need better explanations about how this whole dating thing works before i really put any more effort into it.

* * *

I really don't like the way my face looks. I really am going to delete this online dating profile, and then do something else. Well, I don't know. I really don't know. I really have no idea what to do about that. on the one hand, people think that you're weird if you don't do a whole lot of dating, or, if you don't seem to be interested in dating.

* * *

Alright. In spite of the fact that I really am annoyed by the whole dating stuff. I decided to upload a new photograph of myself to Plenty of Fish, and I really don't like this photograph of myself. It's a garbage quality photograph of myself. and I really do not like it.

Maybe I have to take pictures in front of something, like, I don't fucking know, the grand canyon or something. some kind of amazing geological feature. or something.

I'm going to write off dating and relationships as more or less a pointless pursuit. Waste of fucking money. Really. I wonder why I spent money on the Plenty of Fish subscription. The app and website have more or less become webcam porn platforms. fucking waste of time. fucking waste of money. I may consider deleting the account and moving on. i really have to write that off as a non-worthwhile pursuit. i'm just so frustrated about it.

maybe there are all kinds of dating advice. stuff. out there, but nothing has really ever worked for me. um. and i just hate doing it anyway.

* * *

I don't know what to do about the sort of dating and relationships aspect of life. I really have a lot of doubts when it comes to online dating. I'm never sure if the person on the other side has any real intention of dating, or, is just looking to kill time. I really don't. and that's the thing about dating. is the other person just looking to kill time, or is the other person interested in. you know.

i really don't want to sign up for any more online dating accounts. I signed up for Plenty of Fish on the basis of most articles saying it's the best option for anyone looking for a hook-up, and. honestly. i didn't get a single hook-up. fucking waste of money. fucking waste of time. real waste.

and i resent the idea, or the cultural attitude that i should be looking for something other than a hook-up. i simply don't understand it. i simply don't understand why i would want something other than a hook-up. i really don't. i really fucking don't. and i hate saying that. i don't understand it.

* * *

What I mean is. I don't want to change too much with my blog in terms of making any serious style changes.

I really don't want to change anything here. At least not any time soon. I mean. I really don't want to change anything with my blog any time soon.

Another reason is that many employers offer tuition and education reimbursement incentives. It's not really a huge indignity to bag groceries, or pour coffee, or pack boxes, or count cash.

The reason I'm not entirely in favor of student loan forgiveness is this: education expenses receive a tax credit, a portion of student loan payments are tax deductible, so anyone receiving student loan forgiveness is triple dipping at the tax-payer's expense.

The main issues that are weighing on my mind right now are: getting into graduate school, paying for graduate school, paying back any student loans that I might accumulate while attending graduate school, completing graduate school without running out of cash and credit, and then finding employment sufficiently remunerative such that any student loans I have to pay back aren't excessively burdensome.

* * *

Even though I might be getting distracted. Or at least I feel like I'm getting distracted. It's possible that I'm getting more done than I think. What is one thing that I would like to get done? Well, complete another Copyright Registration. The issue here isn't time. It's money. I'm already stretched super thin in terms of money, and I really don't have any money to spend on pet projects, but in a way, when I say that, I know that I've spent more on lunches than. You know. Impulse purchases are issues too. you know. and I'm wasting money in one area or another, that should be better used in some other area.

* * *

This is probably a useless thing to point out, but I have a folder for links that I have used in the past, but, don't plan on using anytime soon, they may be specific in some way, like, a specific facebook page. I might not. i obviously don't need to bookmark facebook, but there may be a specific facebook page that i might want to book mark. anyway. i have a specific bookmarks folder for bookmarks that are kind of like that. super specific pages in. anyway. the situation there is that I had folders within my archived bookmark folders. i fixed that issue of having folders within my archived bookmarks folder for bookmarks of pages within websites that i want to bookmark, but the main website doesn't need to be bookmarked. stupid trivial issue.

* * *

Fuck. Let me think for a minute. Incessant distractions. There was something that I was thinking about. Okay. it's about the wash loss rule regarding stock trading. I wouldn't be worrying about this right now, however, I basically did not get. My unemployment insurance claim was not approved, or, disqualified, so I'm basically selling the shares I have in my Robinhood account to cover my current needs, and this also wouldn't be an issue, however, the current market prices of the shares I'm selling are below my cost-basis for the shares that I'm selling.

So I'm selling my fucking shares at a realized loss, and this has the potential to cause me to run afoul of the wash-sale rule in the event that I'm not realizing my capital losses correctly.

You know. There's a fucking correct way to lose money and shit. what a fucking nightmare.

* * *

I'm trying to think about something. Well. It may have been possible that my. that the money I spent on the Meningitis Vaccine for college, would have been paid for by my employer health plan, but I'm not sure.

* * *

What do I need to work on? Okay. I got distracted again. Transcribing notes. working on stuff for my twitter profile. I just can't believe how much time I've been spending on there. There was an Automated Profile, or an Automated Bot Re-Tweeter that caught my attention, and I found it interesting. I ended up experimenting with emojis for a while.

The other day I was at the gas station. I was at the QuikTrip across the street from my residence, and this lady asked me if I was on-foot. if i was walking, and i made a mention that i have a car, and i'm fully capable of driving. i just enjoy walking. she offered me a bike. she said the bike was perfectly fine. she said the bike worked perfectly fine. and she offered to let me have it. she said she just left it there for anyone who wanted it.

so, i took it and rode it around the empty parking lot behind the gas station. and the bike did work just fine, but when i tried to stop the bike. i realized that the bike's breaks were not functional. the breaks did not work. and i realized that the bike was actually dangerous to ride anywhere other than in an empty parking lot. since the bike didn't have working breaks. it would have been dangerous to ride anywhere other than in the empty parking lot. so i left it in the parking lot.

i thought it would be helpful to simply throw the bike away, since it was dangerous to ride. i thought that. whatever medical bills a person would incur getting into an accident on that bike were much greater than any medical bills a person would incur simply walking to the same location. you know. so. i really thought it would be most prudent to throw the bike away.

i do. really. sometimes feel bad when i throw things away that other people perceive as being useful.

...

I can't take an infinite amount of classes. I mean. I can't take an unlimited number of electives. Mainly because I don't have an infinite amount of money. One of the scholarships that I came across was actually kind of awesome, but, I think there is a preference for students pursuing an undergraduate degree, even though it didn't explicitly say so.

...

Electives: Math Classes / this was changed to mathematics - i might change the programming electives section into something more broad. one thing i want to point out is that. there are three areas. right. communications. linguistics. foreign languages. and they seem similar.

* * *

When I think about certain things I think that. maybe. that was. sort of. to make something. i don't know how to say it. or even if i want to say it.

* * *

When I logged back in to see. to check my Google AdSense account, there were so many things that were different, and, I really couldn't figure out what to do with it. I might put this objective on the back burner for right now: " - Advertising: Google AdSense Compliance " I don't want to get delisted. or black listed. or totally removed from AdSense monetization. I really have only ever made about 1 dollar annually from hosting Google AdSense ads, I really haven't made very much money doing it.

* * *

I feel like I have too much fucking stuff. Like too much stuff. too many things that I don't really need.

* * *

There's currently a generalized bias against obtaining a university education, or, attending graduate school, and there's kind of a preference for trade school training or. there's kind of a bias. i feel. currently. in favor of attending a trade school or vocational school. for some reason i wasn't able to make much progress when i was trying to learn coding. i don't know why i had so much trouble with it.

* * *

I have this notice to renew my vehicle registration with Texas. There are a number of things that I need to take care of. I went to the library, but I didn't really get a whole lot done. I was in the middle of something, and there seemed to be a parade somewhere downtown. I'm not going to say that I was distracted as a result, and I'm not going to say that I couldn't concentrate as a result, but, for some reason I left the library and went back home.

There are times when I really can't concentrate, and, I'm not able to get very much work done.

...

 Figure Out  /  those things
that are hard to understand
for other people
but for you are a breeze to understand.

...

I want to cut down on the amount of stuff that I have. I don't like throwing things away because I feel that I might be perceived as wasteful if I do so, and this is considering that I really don't have very many contacts. I don't really know anyone, and I really haven't made very many friends since I moved here.

Socializing can be a full time job in itself, and, I'm not really sure it has a better payoff than simply logging more time at work, or, spending more time learning new things and skills.

* * *

I took a shower, and shaved my head and face. I feel funny when I haven't shaved in a while, I feel dirty, and I feel that I look dirty too, but there was this point during my shaving where I only had my moustache unshaved, and for a minute I thought that I actually look kind of nice with facial hair. I didn't want to over think the issue, so I shaved it off.

...

New Item: I want to get a new computer. a laptop, but. i want to get a new laptop computer, or at the very least, i want to look into it. i know that my current laptop is more or less just fine, and it's not really necessary for me to buy a new one. i just want to look into it.

...

some of the places
there aren't real
and some of those
profile are fake and
bogus to give an impression
that things are more impressive
than they really are.

I'm looking at the course catalog at UTA. and I'm coming across the word "Modality" and I remember this from UMKC. I feel so fucking bad. that. I didn't go to graduate school sooner. and. I'm going to feel really bad if this ends up being just another time where. just another time where I don't end up attending for one reason or another.

I found the course catalog. There is a 
lot of clutter. everywhere.
quite a bit of it is actually bogus.

...

Notes: Deep fake or deepfake is a. manipulation of moving pictures, or digital videos using artificial intelligence.

I remember seeing this video of a scene from the Shining (1980) where, I think the video was a deepfake, it was a scene from the Shining performed by Jack Nicholson, but I think that. I think that it was Jim Carey. Jim Carey's face was deepfaked over Jack Nicholson's face.

I wanted to say that Jim Carey's face was superimposed over Jack Nicholson's face, but. that wouldn't be really accurate. anyway. it's called a deepfake, and, it was kind of interesting to learn about that.

It's definitely kind of scary as well. 

...

So for the unemployment disqualification, I think that I'll just not appeal in this case. The unpaid wages issue is something that I'll deal with, but, I mean it's something I'll look out for, but, I'm really not counting on getting anything out of that.

When it comes to accepting work from someone, I'd say this: you can't really count on a complete stranger paying you for your work, what happened in my case is I worked for someone I didn't really know, and the business didn't seem to be a really formalized business, and when I asked for my paycheck, the person simply didn't pay me.

In a lot of cases you're really on your own when it comes to getting paid for work that you do. I've never had any trouble with larger businesses, but I know that, going forward, I just have to be skeptical about job offers, or offers of employment from people I meet at a restaurant or bar. I won't do that again.

Greetings Office of the Registrar:

I'm applying to the University of Texas at Arlington, and transcripts have been requested from UNLV, which I was admitted to, but neve attended. UNLV doesn't seem to use a transcript intermediary like Parchment or the National Student Clearing House, so I'm requesting that whatever student file or transcripts I have with UNLV be sent to UTA at this email address: grad.recruit@uta.edu.

I don't think that I need to get transcripts from UNLV and have them sent to UTA, the reason being is that I was admitted to UNLV, but I never attended, I put in a transcript request anyway. It's on my outstanding items for UTA, but, my application is noted as being complete.

...

The library is more or less closed right now. I'll have to wait until tomorrow to finish some of the things that I'm working on.

...

I want to go grocery shopping, but I'm not sure I really need anything, or at least, I'm not sure that I'm at a critically low level with anything I need. and thinking about it was not helpful.

i don't think that it's fair that I suffer more17m than anyone else.
I fought for the Allies at Stalingrad as part of the Fried Rice Auxiliaries of the Red Army, Ho Chi Minh and Emiliano Zapata were my Comrades in Arms, but the Soviets had logistical problems then, as now, and we were given only one rifle for the three of us.

i think other people need to suffer #vladimirputin

I was able to lookup a. I just recently looked up myself in the copyright office, and I saw that my other series of Tweets was registered. I mean, the registration of those copyrights is complete. I never received a paper conformation of the registration, and. Maybe it just hasn't arrived yet. I tried to upload a screenshot of the new registered copyright, but it didn't upload successfully to anywhere, other at Chestnut + Hazel. I'll leave it alone for now.

I think that many of the content moderation policies on user generated content platforms are unnecessarily broad and many of those policies can be construed to take down any kind of content whatsoever. There's a point where algorithmic or direct curation dilute authenticity.

Okay, so here's a serious solution to the mass casualty incidents that happen incessantly in the United States: let's round up all the serial killers and mass murderers and other violent sociopaths, and have them fight Vladimir Putin. They did it in StarCraft.

There was something else that bothered me. I don't remember what it was. Something similar to the incident at the coffee shop. I want to think about what it was. I just don't remember. I remember thinking about it just a few minutes ago, and wanting to think about it, and wanting to write about it.

Keep Tabs on / Keep Tabs on / Current Goals

* * *

what was one thing i had issues with the other day. i felt like i was being subject to passive aggressive behavior the other day, and, i really don't know how to handle this sort of thing when it happens, and it really has been happening more and more when interacting with people who work in service roles, but i. honestly. i see it more and more almost everywhere.

the issue was that, i ordered a coffee, right, and it wasn't anything special, basically, i just wanted a regular cup of coffee, he insisted that it be done as a pour over, when that was clearly unnecessary, then he said that the pour over filters had broke 3 times in a row, on 3 separate occasions, and had to be completely redone every single time.

I eventually just said that i'm sure whatever coffee is currently in the cup will suit me just fine, and that he could consider the task completed, then, he tops off the coffee with some other kind of coffee. i pray to god that the people who treat me this way, are on the receiving end of the same behavior. and i'm going to go ahead and pray, that i'm able to catch myself if i find myself being passive-aggressive in my own conduct.

i'm sure that sometimes passive-aggressive behavior is all that people have sometimes, but, i really think that when people do it to me, it's uncalled for, it's completely un-instigated. they do it to me when i haven't done anything to them. i was just ordering a cup of fucking coffee. sick of this shit. people picking on me.

I think that one of the issues I had with. the getting marked issue. was that. maybe we're all in that stage. maybe things are different, and. even. things aren't really live and let live any more. everything everyone does irritates everyone else. and we all just sort of declare war with each other.

* * *

Yeah, that was dumb, totally not even Reddit Porn. Stupid. Well. Little bit irritated. Not about the post not being real Reddit Porn. or anything, just about miscellaneous other things.

* * *

In many ways also. I think that there is a reason that many people stick to certain platforms and stay away from others. Some of these platforms are really. I don't know. Kind of a garbage.

* * *

I think that many of the content moderation policies on user generated content platforms are unnecessarily broad and many of those policies can be construed to take down any kind of content whatsoever: there's a point where algorithmic curation or direct curation begin to dilute authenticity.

There seems to be pornography, on Twitter. Nothing to freak out about of course. I wonder why this page was marked as adult content? it was probably because someone wanted this to be caught by company or content filters, but there is really more or less no pornography here.

I'm going to suggest that many of the content regulations on any content platform are really unnecessarily broad. Many of them can be construed to take down any kind of content whatsoever.

* * *

I think that one of the things to remember is. don't work somewhere for the wrong reasons. you know. well. i wonder if she secretly was mad at me for the backpack incident. so what was the backpack incident, or the incident of the backpack. or maybe the backpack controversy. well, she gave us backpacks, and, i left it there. i didn't take it with me, and it was a really nice back pack. but. i left it there and didn't take it with me.

* * *

Okay, so here's a serious solution to the mass casualty incidents that happen incessantly in the United States: let's round up all the serial killers and mass murderers and other violent sociopaths, and have them fight Vladimir Putin. They did it in StarCraft.

One of the issues I have is that I grew up in San Jose, California during the Information Age, and as a result, I have an inability to comprehend what a violent crime is. I grew up thinking the Incident at Littleton, Colorado was some kind of artifact of cinematography.

Pope Francis also made a comment about declining birthrates, he said something along the lines of: people who don't start families are self-indulgent, and I thought; he's right, median per capita income in the Vatican City is 180,000 USD, and none of those guys have families.

I think that one of the things to remember is. don't work somewhere for the wrong reasons. you know. well. i wonder if she secretly was mad at me for the backpack incident.

* * *

🤖What powerful but 
unrecorded race👽
🐨Once dwelt in that 
annihilated place🗿

* * *

I think that it's dealt with. Please don't drag me into any more issues. please. Now. What the hell do I need to do. I don't know why so many life distractions are thrown at me. I really don't every fucking day and every fucking hour over every fucking little thing in the universe. this is really a nightmare.

* * *

Anyway, on of the ways that I considered getting rid of the Viator INC Supplier account, was to create another email, and use that new email to unconnected the old account, and then get rid of it that way, but.

There is a mail log-in email, so I figured I would just use a throwaway email to create a new main log in email, and then jettison the account after removing the log-in credentials for prospectus.media.group@gmail.com.

The issue with this idea. is that my Viator, INC supplier account had my financial institution information connected as well, and there was no way of deleting my financial institution information from the account.

So I was stuck with making an official request from the supplier support agent through the chat application.

* * *

When I think about why I will never work on a contract or temporary basis again, part of it is due to what I'll say was this kind of traumatic experience with Viator, INC. I won't ever work for a temporary placement agency again. Nightmare. Never. I was harmed, emotionally and psychologically from that employment experience with Viator, INC, and I really just want to let it go, but every time I get a SPAM email from that company. you know. I start having serious. like. issues. anyway. let's hope tomorrow is a better day.

* * *

I'm sure that there is a valid reason for an account to be difficult to delete, but, I don't know. I should have been able to delete it sooner. I had no intention of starting a tour company or anything, so, like, why was it so difficult to delete? anyway. I guess that's over. I hope.

* * *

I didn't go to bunriths funeral. not because i didn't care to go or because i thought that i
had more important things to do. but. the issue was that i didn't want to go back
to the bay area. i was fucking homeless my last few months there, and even though
i don't feel like my life was totally bad during those months of homelessness. i just
harbored a hell of a lot of resentment for the way that things went.

* * *

notes and reflections

* * *

Okay, so I think that I was able to successfully delete the Viator, INC Supplier Account. That really took a long time. I think. It just doesn't have an option to delete it. Nowhere in the platform is a way to press a button and delete the account. So. I want to say I had it for about 4 or 5 years, and just left it fallow, or unused.

* * *

Viator, INC notes.

Still trying to delete this account.

I would like to delete this account completely, but there doesn't seem to be an option for doing that. There doesn't seem to be a mechanism for doing that, how do I delete this account.

to Viator, omnibusenquiries, me

Greeting Viator, INC:

I'm not sure what to do about this: I've never had any intention of operating a tour company, nor have I ever had any interest whatsoever in tourism, hospitality, traveling, or any commercial activities appurtenant to tourism, or hospitality, or traveling.

I've actually tried to delete this account, as well as a number of other accounts for a few years now, and I've found it impossible to do so.

I'm sincerely unsure of how to handle this.

Sincerely,

Kenneth Larot Yamat

There is a woman on twitter. who. i'm kind of trying to engage in dialogue with, but, i'm afraid that if i interact with her directly. and i say the wrong thing. she'll block me. i think that she's part of the UX debate. which i actually haven't really researched very much. i just sort of. post shit with the tag #UX, and say something.

I'm just trying to think.

The most eerie aspect of the recent mass tragedies is that they seem to correspond to six help wanted ads posted on the dark web by SN:

I guess I don't have any applicable products, and in this case, these requirements do not apply to me. I've tried to delete this Viator Supplier account, but, I guess I'm unable to do that.

Current Goals:

Education
    - Keep Tabs on Admissions and Deadlines
    - Keep Tabs on Student Loans and Financial Aid
    - Internships
    - Languages
    - Math Classes
    - Programming
    - Finance outside of finance 
Employment
    -  Internships
    - University Career Resources
    - Relocation Opportunities
Texas Workforce Commission
    - Decide to Appeal or Not
    - Keep Tabs on Unpaid Wages

* * *

Is there a single word that can be used in place of: keep tabs? I think of stylistic choices. I've notices that people on Twitter either keep hash tags inside of the text, at the top of the text or at the bottom. I remember that citation style guides with either have in-text citations, or parenthetical citations, and others would have superscript citations, with either foot notes or end notes.

* * *

Current Goals:

Research Electives
    - Languages
    - Math Classes
    - Programming
    - Finance outside of finance 
Employment
    - Find Internships
    - Review Career Center Resources
    - Different Relocation Opportunities
Texas Workforce Commission
    - Decide to Appeal or Not
    - Keep Tabs on Unpaid Wages

* * *

I think I'll retitle the section "Research Electives" into a more general section "Education"

* * *

I think that while writing down my thoughts and reflections about what happened during any given day, I'll come across things that I need to do, things that I want to do, or things that I want to get done, or whatever. I think that I'll just add and subtract things, keep them floating at the top or whatever, floating at the top of each post.

* * *

Reiterate my Current Goals:

Research Electives
    - Languages
    - Math Classes
    - Programming
    - Finance outside of finance 
Employment
    - Find Internships
    - Review Career Center Resources
    - Different Relocation Opportunities
Texas Workforce Commission
    - Decide to Appeal or Not
    - Keep Tabs on Unpaid Wages

* * *

I'm going to. I have this idea. I'm going to keep goals at the top of each post.

* * *

Notes on recent goals

3 research electives
4 research post-graduation employment opportunities
1 edit the blog
        - This is important, but it's a major back-burner kind of an issue, so I'm just not dealing with it.
2 apply for scholarships
        - There aren't any scholarships for the program that I'm applying for.
5 figure out the tour company stuff
        - This to-do item never seems to get resolved, my tour guide account with Viator.com, isn't active               or live or functional in any way, but there also seems to be no way to fucking delete the account.
6 social media presence clean-up
        - I've decided against this for the time being.

* * *

"It is a great piece of skill to know how to guide your luck, even while you're waiting for it."

"You will receive a surprising gift very soon"

"Adversity is the parent of virtue"

These were some of adages or epigrams on the fortune cookies that I had in my wallet. Sometimes I read into things, and then, sometimes I think these things don't really mean anything.

What would my response to each one be:
    - What sort of luckiness should I be watching out for and guiding?
    - What surprising gift should I be looking out for
    - I think I was previously told: "Virtue lies in the struggle, not the prize."

* * *

Today there is an event at the stadium, and the traffic is bad, and I'm wondering if there will be parking when I get home. I went out for groceries, just a few sodas, and I'm wondering if maybe I should hang out in the grocery store parking lot or not.
I'm trying to think. i think the reason that i get blocked. on twitter. is that if a person's tone is. i don't know. patronizing. or condescending. trivializing. or marginalizing. or snide or snarky. i'll usually adopt a similar tone. and it usually just pisses people off.

* * *

what the hell do I have to do? I have stay off twitter. I've only been blocked a hand full of times. I want to say three. I'm sure i've pissed everyone off. anyway. what i'm thinking about. going back to the completion of my graduate school application. is that. i am really fucking scared. i do have to take out student loans to get through school. and i know that i'll have to pay them back. This is really fucking scary. taking out student loans. and i'm not sure.

but i'm thinking that i really just need to be careful about it. going to graduate school is something that i've been wanting to do for a while. i might as well just do it, and take it as it comes.

to Viator, omnibusenquiries, me

Greeting Viator, INC:

I'm not sure what to do about this: I've never had any intention of operating a tour company, nor have I ever had any interest whatsoever in tourism, hospitality, traveling, or any commercial activities appurtenant to tourism, or hospitality, or traveling.

I've actually tried to delete this account, as well as a number of other accounts for a few years now, and I've found it impossible to do so.

I'm sincerely unsure of how to handle this.

Sincerely,

Greeting Viator, INC:

I guess I don't have any applicable products, and in this case, these requirements do not apply to me. I've tried to delete this Viator Supplier account, but, I guess I'm unable to do that.

Current Goals:

Education
    - Keep Tabs on Admissions and Deadlines
    - Keep Tabs on Student Loans and Financial Aid
    - Internships
    - Languages
    - Math Classes
    - Programming
    - Finance outside of finance 
Employment
    -  Internships
    - University Career Resources
    - Relocation Opportunities
Texas Workforce Commission
    - Decide to Appeal or Not
    - Keep Tabs on Unpaid Wages

* * *

Is there a single word that can be used in place of: keep tabs? I think of stylistic choices. I've notices that people on Twitter either keep hash tags inside of the text, at the top of the text or at the bottom. I remember that citation style guides with either have in-text citations, or parenthetical citations, and others would have superscript citations, with either foot notes or end notes.

* * *

Current Goals:

Research Electives
    - Languages
    - Math Classes
    - Programming
    - Finance outside of finance 
Employment
    - Find Internships
    - Review Career Center Resources
    - Different Relocation Opportunities
Texas Workforce Commission
    - Decide to Appeal or Not
    - Keep Tabs on Unpaid Wages

* * *

I think I'll retitle the section "Research Electives" into a more general section "Education"

* * *

I think that while writing down my thoughts and reflections about what happened during any given day, I'll come across things that I need to do, things that I want to do, or things that I want to get done, or whatever. I think that I'll just add and subtract things, keep them floating at the top or whatever, floating at the top of each post.

* * *

Reiterate my Current Goals:

Research Electives
    - Languages
    - Math Classes
    - Programming
    - Finance outside of finance 
Employment
    - Find Internships
    - Review Career Center Resources
    - Different Relocation Opportunities
Texas Workforce Commission
    - Decide to Appeal or Not
    - Keep Tabs on Unpaid Wages

* * *

I'm going to. I have this idea. I'm going to keep goals at the top of each post.

* * *

Notes on recent goals

3 research electives
4 research post-graduation employment opportunities
1 edit the blog
        - This is important, but it's a major back-burner kind of an issue, so I'm just not dealing with it.
2 apply for scholarships
        - There aren't any scholarships for the program that I'm applying for.
5 figure out the tour company stuff
        - This to-do item never seems to get resolved, my tour guide account with Viator.com, isn't active               or live or functional in any way, but there also seems to be no way to fucking delete the account.
6 social media presence clean-up
        - I've decided against this for the time being.

* * *

"It is a great piece of skill to know how to guide your luck, even while you're waiting for it."

"You will receive a surprising gift very soon"

"Adversity is the parent of virtue"

These were some of adages or epigrams on the fortune cookies that I had in my wallet. Sometimes I read into things, and then, sometimes I think these things don't really mean anything.

What would my response to each one be:
    - What sort of luckiness should I be watching out for and guiding?
    - What surprising gift should I be looking out for
    - I think I was previously told: "Virtue lies in the struggle, not the prize."

* * *

Today there is an event at the stadium, and the traffic is bad, and I'm wondering if there will be parking when I get home. I went out for groceries, just a few sodas, and I'm wondering if maybe I should hang out in the grocery store parking lot or not.
I'm trying to think. i think the reason that i get blocked. on twitter. is that if a person's tone is. i don't know. patronizing. or condescending. trivializing. or marginalizing. or snide or snarky. i'll usually adopt a similar tone. and it usually just pisses people off.

The most eerie aspect of the recent mass tragedies is that these seem to correspond to six help wanted ads posted on the illicit internet or dark web posted by Vladimir Nikita Stalin:

* * *

what the hell do I have to do? I have stay off twitter. I've only been blocked a hand full of times. I want to say three. I'm sure i've pissed everyone off. anyway. what i'm thinking about. going back to the completion of my graduate school application. is that. i am really fucking scared. i do have to take out student loans to get through school. and i know that i'll have to pay them back. This is really fucking scary. taking out student loans. and i'm not sure.

but i'm thinking that i really just need to be careful about it. going to graduate school is something that i've been wanting to do for a while. i might as well just do it, and take it as it comes.

* * *



I don't know what I did, but for several days I've had nothing but incoming calls regarding positions with various companies or whatever, but, I already have a start date for my next position, so I haven't responded, and it has been kind of distracting. It's. Well. I kind of have to figure out what I need to get done.

* * *

There really aren't any scholarships for the program I'm applying for.

* * *

What a nightmare. I can't sleep. Again. 2 days. And all this shit that's going on. Domestically and internationally. I can't sleep. I thought about going kayaking, forget it.






* * *

Mass tragedies and mass casualty incidents. Nightmares. Real nightmares. I don't entirely want to think about these things every single fucking day. There's a desire just to forget about these things.

How much can I really fucking do to solve these issues?

I deal with nightmares every single night. and every single day. and all the fucking time.

I often feel like I'm forced to speak about things, and. I know that I'm just going to say the wrong fucking things.

and you know that I'm going to say the wrong fucking things. so why do you ask me to say things?

* * *

I remember him saying something like: self-deprecating humor doesn't always facilitate vocational success.

But I also remember being told that humility is virtuous.

I just dont know what the hell to do about that, about the, sexual content warning. No one reads this blog. 

And I only make about a dollar a year anyway from hosting banner ads.

* * *

What the hell? Sexual content violation? Fucking. Vladimir Putin! 

I could have sworn I took all the boob photograph collections down. Stupid.

* * *

I didn't get any sleep the other night. I was up for most of the day. I didn't have nightmares, but I had daydreams bearing the quality of nightmares. I need to apply for a scholarship, or something; I had the intention of doing that today, but I was just too tired. 

* * *

Okay. I'm also having nightmares.

* * *

Yeah, so, I apologize for unsuccessfully flirting with women on Twitter. There. 

I also apologize for attempting to successfully flirt with women on Twitter.

I don't know what else to say. About that.

* * *

So what was it? Um. Here is how I feel: I want to pursue the things that I'm interested in. I don't want to get distracted by all this other nonsense.

* * *

Taverna - Bistro - Pub - Public House

* * *

I think title casing refers to all-caps and UI refers to user interface, but I have to look that up.

* * *

an LMS is a learning management system

* * *

My unemployment claim was denied or disqualified or whatever. so. i really just have to wait until i start work. i think. i think that all my expenses are paid through the end of june anyway. and i do
 have food that i can eat. food at my residence. that. i can actually eat.

* * *

additional specific requirements may need to be submitted. there is always some kind of small detail or another that needs to be addressed. but. as far as i can tell. i think everything is. i don't know. prepared.

* * *

i think that i basically have to wait for an admissions decision before and kind of stuff related to student loans, grants or financial aid is determined. most of the paragraphs end with something like. you college will notify you of such and such award determination.

* * *

NSF stands for National Science Foundation.

* * *

I might be looking at this thing for a while.

* * *

grants.gov is actually a kind of interesting. i don't know what to call it. like a database or archive of whatever kind of grants are available for. whatever kind of projects are deemed necessary. 

* * *

what am i dealing with. right now. at this very moment? well. i'm organizing some of my archived files on my laptop. i have to think. yeah. this is a waste of time. somewhat of a waste of time. but it is something that i want to do. and it is something that i consider kind of important.

Years ago I was at a bar and this woman was talking about some kind of reptilian🐊 conspiracy and I wanted cast a reasonable doubt about how the conspiracy could just as easily be perpetuated by the octopusilians🐙🦑, insectilians🦋, or robotilians🤖.

I think that. I want to say that people can throw around the word: investing. and i think that it's important to understand investing versus over investing. being invested in something is usually a good thing. investing in something is usually a good thing, but there are times when an investment proves to be. an investment might prove to be a bad one. and of course. i've been there in terms of having invested in something that turned out to be a bad investment.

* * *

So what did I do today? well. I went out to eat at three different places. I had ice cream, pasta, and barbecue, and that's a very generic description of the places that I went to eat at today. I have to watch out about wasting, or spending, or over investing my time doing internet crap. and. i have to watch out about wasting, or spending, or over investing my time going out and eating everything that i can.

* * *

What do I need to work on? Okay. I got distracted again. Transcribing notes. working on stuff for my twitter profile. I just can't believe how much time I've been spending on there. There was an Automated Profile, or an Automated Bot Re-Tweeter that caught my attention, and I found it interesting. I ended up experimenting with emojis for a while.

UTA: Post UTA Employment Prospects
        My thinking is that I could make myself more marketable post-graduation by having a broader                skill set. Taking classes. Taking electives that are finance related, but, i don't want to have too                narrow a viewpoint on the subject.

an UEI is a unique entity identifier.

The main issues that are weighing on my mind right now are: 

UTA: Acceptance
            Notes: I think that my application is in order. I think I've submitted everything that UTA has                    requested, and I think that at this point it's just a matter of being accepted or rejected. I think                    that I wrote to UTA about the transcripts issue with UNLV, I received an admissions decision                from UNLV, and was admitted, but I never attended.

UTA: Payment
            I don't even know what the fuck to do about this.

The main issues that are weighing on my mind right now are: 

getting into graduate school, 

paying for graduate school, 

paying back any student loans that I might accumulate while attending graduate school, 

completing graduate school without running out of cash and credit,
 
and then finding employment sufficiently remunerative such that any student loans I have to pay back aren't excessively burdensome.

Fuck. Let me think for a minute. Incessant distractions. There was something that I was thinking about. Okay. it's about the wash loss rule regarding stock trading. I wouldn't be worrying about this right now, however, I basically did not get. My unemployment insurance claim was not approved, or, disqualified, so I'm basically selling the shares I have in my Robinhood account to cover my current needs, and this also wouldn't be an issue, however, the current market prices of the shares I'm selling are below my cost-basis for the shares that I'm selling.

So I'm selling my fucking shares at a realized loss, and this has the potential to cause me to run afoul of the wash-sale rule in the event that I'm not realizing my capital losses correctly.

You know. There's a fucking correct way to lose money and shit. what a fucking nightmare.

* * *

I'm trying to think about something. Well. It may have been possible that my. that the money I spent on the Meningitis Vaccine for college, would have been paid for by my employer health plan, but I'm not sure.

I'm still starting to think that I really need to limit the amount of time that I spend on Twitter. I really do. The time I spend on there is. I don't know. Time I could spend doing something else.

Notes: an IEP is an Individualized Education Program. It's a program that pertains specifically to Individuals with Disabilities 

* * *

So what do I have to think about right now? Well, I'm at the City of Arlington Main Library. I'm using the wi-fi connection to the Internet, and I'm basically blogging. There are a number of things that I need to get done, and I'm certain that I will get them done. One of the issues that has been on my mind has been whether or not to subscribe to an Internet connection service. I'm honestly. Using a metered Internet connection.

* * *

There are a number of people
writing stuff at their desks
and surfing the content available
everywhere that it is offered.

* * *

The main issues that are weighing on my mind right now are: getting into graduate school, paying for graduate school, paying back any student loans that I might accumulate while attending graduate school, completing graduate school without running out of cash and credit, and then finding employment sufficiently remunerative such that any student loans I have to pay back aren't excessively burdensome.

* * *

Even though I might be getting distracted. Or at least I feel like I'm getting distracted. It's possible that I'm getting more done than I think. What is one thing that I would like to get done? Well, complete another Copyright Registration. The issue here isn't time. It's money. I'm already stretched super thin in terms of money, and I really don't have any money to spend on pet projects, but in a way, when I say that, I know that I've spent more on lunches than. You know. Impulse purchases are issues too. you know. and I'm wasting money in one area or another, that should be better used in some other area.

* * *

This is probably a useless thing to point out, but I have a folder for links that I have used in the past, but, don't plan on using anytime soon, they may be specific in some way, like, a specific facebook page. I might not. i obviously don't need to bookmark facebook, but there may be a specific facebook page that i might want to book mark. anyway. i have a specific bookmarks folder for bookmarks that are kind of like that. super specific pages in. anyway. the situation there is that I had folders within my archived bookmark folders. i fixed that issue of having folders within my archived bookmarks folder for bookmarks of pages within websites that i want to bookmark, but the main website doesn't need to be bookmarked. stupid trivial issue.

Fuck. Let me think for a minute. Incessant distractions. There was something that I was thinking about. Okay. it's about the wash loss rule regarding stock trading. I wouldn't be worrying about this right now, however, I basically did not get. My unemployment insurance claim was not approved, or, disqualified, so I'm basically selling the shares I have in my Robinhood account to cover my current needs, and this also wouldn't be an issue, however, the current market prices of the shares I'm selling are below my cost-basis for the shares that I'm selling.

So I'm selling my fucking shares at a realized loss, and this has the potential to cause me to run afoul of the wash-sale rule in the event that I'm not realizing my capital losses correctly.

You know. There's a fucking correct way to lose money and shit. what a fucking nightmare.

anyway. i'm broke now. so. gotta stop spending money. or. more money than i should be spending. i went out to eat. today is monday, so, nothing was too crowded. i felt bad about being angry the other day about how crowded everything was. even though i didn't take my anger out on anyone. i was just. grouchy. i guess. i guess i felt bad about feeling angry.
















* * *


what am i thinking about right now? spending too much money. again. but. in many cases. some of these things are things that i need. i need to calm down. what else? i might have an earlier than expected start date to work. so. that might work in my favor.

Yeah Nancy, I wouldn't even be bothered by being
denied communion in accordance with canon law 915.
I was actually Excommunicated from the Holy See by
being baptized an acolyte of Christianity & Company
Incorporated, PLC (Société anonyme). so. You know.
It's like that.


* * *


what about school, well. there are a few things. i think. if i have to. if i have an opportunity to take elective courses. and supposing that i have the opportunity to take elective courses that are not specifically finance, or quantitative finance related. i think.


and i think that i tried to do this when i was trying to get enrolled at UMKC, was to study finance related topics. or topics that are i guess. or that i thought would by synergistic to finance. like project valuation and real estate valuation. i think that these were under civil engineering or urban planning, or one or the other or under real estate or whatever.


but um. i guess i would study other stuff related to valuation. software programming or coding or something. foreign languages. legal studies courses related to business and finance. economics and mathematics.


* * *


issues with social media stuff. well. i want to include dating apps and online dating stuff in general as part of social media. well. i get blocked. most of the time. and i mean blocked as in kind of a do-not-interact notification. so. in many ways this is kind of useless. blocking is something that i do to other people. and. it's honestly something that a lot of people do to me too. it's just the way it goes. we really don't have to interact with each other if we don't want to. mark as spam. block. mute. sequester. we all do it.

What else do I need to get done today? I need to apply for scholarships and shit. There's this kind of hang-up with UNLV. I was accepted, but never attended. I did intend to attend, but never attended. Anyway, I'm guessing that I would have a file with UNLV, but not a list of classes that I enrolled and withdrew from. and I think that I would have a student ID with UNLV, but I don't know how this whole business of transcripts would go.


* * *


I try to participate in survey responses as much as I can. I think. I think that it's important to cast my vote in whatever way I can, in whatever issue my vote is needed, even if it's just a question about how I'm using or interacting with a mobile app, or website.


* * *


but i don't really know if i really want to deal with ONEQ. There is really a whole lot of bull shit on a lot of these total market index funds, and i really don't want to deal with a lot of them. stupid. stupid. I know. there's just a lot of shitty ones on the index. zombie ticker symbols on the index. some of them never fall off the index. well. i don't know. a lot of them are garbage.


* * *


I did manage to take care of a few things with my old. With my 401(k). and that was kind of nice. I don't know. what else to do. there were a few student loan, student aid, and student grant related stuff for school. I don't recall. exactly what the deadline is for the application period. I want to say that it is 06/04/2022.


* * *


Fucking Twitter. I have to say off of there. There is one thing that is kind of cool. and. I guess I haven't kept up with it. but I did notice that ONEQ has a much lower share price than it had before. and. I looked it up, but there was a stock split for that ETF some time last year. thank god. really. some of these index ETFs have. they're kind of rolling with higher share prices than I would really like to deal with.

what the hell do i do about. fuck. what the hell do i do about this other content and stuff? there are a few things that i'm thinking about. about graduate school. in terms of electives. and how these electives can help me in other ways. fucking twitter. in many ways i think it better that i just stay off there. i need to learn a foreign language or something. maybe a few programming languages.

they are not real. leave them alone.

they are not real. all

in a lot of ways I think. people
can be assholes to each other.
and be proud of it for doing so.

What did I have trouble with today? It was just before the lunch hour, and every place I went to was so crowded. Panic and anxiety. Too many people, not enough space. Irritated. I know I don't live in a suburban town. I know I don't live in a rural area. Maybe once you are a farm kid, you are always a farm kid.

Notes from Arlington, Texas # 45

* * *

Working nights is just better for my personality. Or, I think my personality and lifestyle are just better suited for working nights. This new position that I accepted is during the day, and. I think that everything will be okay. I don't know how my college application will go, but. 

But I remember when I applied to UMKC, and I remember that most of the classes were after normal work hours, and that, working nights would have conflicted with the school schedule. My work schedule would have interfered with my school schedule. So I would have either had to switch to days or something.

I'm just stressed out and irritated.

* * *

I tried to get something to eat. It's day time on a Sunday. Everything is crowded and I'm just so pissed off.

* * *

I fucking hate being 
up during the day. 
It's too fucking busy. 
It's too fucking crowded.

* * *

Nightmares, but
nothing too serious.

* * *

Every person has its own agenda, I'm 
afraid of everyone I come across, looking 
in the mirror: wondering what I'm after.

green vines knit the

a mandarin collar caresses

her neck, she reads a

Her icy eyes turn to me:
I'll pay for his impudence! 
Time for discipline!

A young woman sobs
walking circles in the courtyard
in a short tight dress with

a pattern like a sherbet

behind her, cut short, a lot

of cleavage, cut high, a lot of

what does her boyfriend want?

I did do maybe three reply guy things.
I think. it was something about a jaw screen shot
and the second one was a thing about
the twitter buy out

but in a way
with the twitter comment that I replied to

she seemed patronizing toward
marginalized groups.
or so. i guess i was being trivializing in
my response about
what i perceived as my own
marginalization.

in both cases the women i twittered responses
to blocked me.

i don't really think that
interacting with other people on
social media is
really

i don't think that it has any kind of value

it's a waste of time
and i think
i think i really should stay off twitter.

waste of time
it doesn't really do anything for me.
it doesn't help me in any way

it doesn't exactly advance the things I want
or whatever.

There are times when I just feel so fucking angry. and I don't know why. or I can describe the reason why. or the reason is hidden somewhere in the back of my mind. repressed.

I was reading remarks made by Justice Clarence Thomas's about how the Rehnquist Court differed from the Robert's Court, and, I think Justice Clarence Thomas takes the position that the Rehnquist Court was more inspiring, or, more relevant to the general public than the Robert's court, and that the workplace dynamic between Justices during the Rehnquist court exhibited more camaraderie than during the Robert's Court.

I remember reading somewhere that the Robert's Court has spent most of its time on cases involving commerce or business or whatever, and, most of those cases are 9-0 unanimous decisions. Like boring shit that only the .001% of the population really cares about.

and then I think, the other thing that Justice Clarence Thomas pointed out, he seemed to tie gun-control or gun-rights with abortion-control or abortion-rights. and I think the point of his remark is that: conservatism is kind of a package deal. if your a conservative, you have a specific set of views regarding both the gun and the abortion debates. and. for me. i don't know if i'll always agree with that.

i've always thought of myself as a conservative, but sometimes when I really think about it. i'm kind of liberal. i'm kind of a liberal. but i also think. that it also kind of depends upon who i'm being compared with. i think i am conservative compared with. you know. a hell of a lot of liberals out there.

The following is an old poem of mine that I wrote a while back. This is from the Chestnut + Hazel archive, and I honestly found it very funny, but, also very sad and depressing as well. I don't know what I was thinking about when I wrote this poem. I really don't. I really think that it's funny. Right now I'm working on just cleaning up my blog and that's pretty much it.

Porn Videos

I'm thinking about creating a new genre of adult films.
Basically they will involve normeenas and gorblanas
engaging in shorblanification of their adamantios moogies.

It will be so nasty, that search engines will not run ads
involving normeenas and gorblanas doing anything at
all, even regular stuff like fishing and flying kites because

The association that people will have with normeenas and
gorblanas will be inherently pornographic, and the acts that
they engage in will be so disgusting that there will even be

Congressional hearings, all on C-Span, discussing the prospect
of regulating the acts that normeenas and gorblanas engage
in. Senators will run on platforms to regulate the normeenas

and gorblanas. Judges will be appointed who are strictly
opposed to sexual relationships between normeenas and
gorlanas. Anti-miscegenation legislation will be on the dockets

of every legislative body to restrict how normeenas and
gorblanas interact. Adoption agencies will be prohibited
from facilitating the adoption of progeny from these unions.

No one will be able to adopt a normeena-gorblana child.
Normeena-gorblana children who are not adopted will grow
up on the streets, selling teleomarkinites and shamdoobies

to make ends meet. They will steal mammyonography from
the adult bookshops and resell them at the swap meet and
flea market and on amazon and ebay and craigslist and letgo.

The normeena-gorblana rights commission will fight the 
oppression of the people, but the commission's funding will
come primarily from the adult film industry, and they will

not be taken seriously, or they will be seen as perpetuation
the perversions of the normeena-gorblana fetishists. A new
political party will emerge to protect the normeenas, and a

separate party will emerge to protect the gorblanas, and new
adult films will feature dirty talk between the two parties and
hardcore magazine will be sold, but buyers will need a permit

from the decency agency in order to buy them. A test will be
administered to see whether or not a person qualifies, only the
most sane and normal people will be allowed to but these books.

* * *

Let me think, just wait for the stuff I want to do, and then. I just really don't want to sell anything out of my Robinhood account. I don't want to sell anything out of my Robinhood account, any of my hobbies have to come out of my paychecks, and not my investments.

* * *

What do I have to deal with. Look, in this case. It really just makes more sense to wait to do a number of things that I want to do. In the mean time. it makes more sense just to do what I need, just the minimum amount of shit I need to survive for the time being, rather than blow all my money trying to do something potentially fruitless.

* * *

Wait until next week to do anything. This is just fucking ridiculous. 

* * *

The smartest thing to do for a number of things, is just wait until I get paid. I really don't want to take any more money from my Robinhood account. I really don't. So what do I have to deal with? just a few bullshits. I can't waste any money. I've already been doing that this entire month.

* * * 

In a lot of ways I kind of have to wait until next week to do a number of things. Well, I don't have to wait until next week. I simply have to. Well. I should wait until next week.

* * *

What the hell should I be working on right now?

* * *

there is a kind of workshop here in the Library. It's kind of neat. there are a bunch of different things that you can use to make things. like arts and crafts and stuff.

* * *

mass emails / patents / chemists / verbiage and dialect localization / contingent upon occupation / professional or occupation based localization / cosmetics / pharmaceuticals / beverages / agriculture / munitions / AWS / DEI = Diversity Equity and Inclusion 

* * *

I need to buy envelopes. what else. I kind of need to buy a battery for my car key, but I'm not really sure I'm going to worry about that.

One thing that is kind of cool about my new place of work, is that it is buy the University of Texas at Arlington Research Institute. I want to describe the area I work in as a kind of Industrial Park.

The thing I kind of want to patent is. and I honestly. I really don't have anything going on with it right now. is some kind of fermentation apparatus, you know:

A fucking home brew beer maker bullshit thing.

I want to check this place out, the Research Institute. 

I um. have or had this idea of: Chestnut + Hazel Laboratories, or Chestnut + Hazel Prototyping, or Chestnut + Hazel Research and Development, or Chestnut + Hazel Designs.

* * *

I have this idea for something I want to patent. It's nothing super interesting. I want to say that whatever it is that I'm going to make is a mere incremental improvement over an existing product.

* * * 

There was something that I was going to work on, but I don't know what it was.

Trademark

Patent

* * *





It's hot, and I'm fucking tired. I went out to eat, just fish and chips like I usually eat when I go out to eat. What the hell was I thinking about? I have to drop off my mail at the post office.

* * *

What the hell do I have to do right now?

* * *

idea for a feature for customer relationship management application / vernacular localization / contingent upon occupation / professional or occupation based localization / for example / cosmetics / pharmaceuticals / beverages / agriculture / munitions / petrochemical / energy

* * *

idea for a feature for customer relationship management software or application / verbiage and dialect localization / contingent upon occupation / professional or occupation based localization / for example / cosmetics / pharmaceuticals / beverages / agriculture / munitions / petrochemical / energy

I'm glad the weekend is just a few hours away. it's hot.

I might be able to figure this out. I really think that I might be able to figure this out.

Research:            Electives
                            Patent and Trademark Process

* * *

I have to look at this again.

* * *

What the hell do I have to do right now?

* * *

i'm thinking. I have a business. and I am a business owner. and I operate a business. It's called: Chestnut + Hazel. and it's an intellectual property business. and what i need to know is how to sell intellectual property.

i really don't need all this other information. I need to know how to sell copyrights.

* * *

what is the issue right now? it just feels like everything is falling apart. it really does. it really fucking does. and maybe. i'm responsible for all of this. and maybe. there were contributors.

* * *

I'm removing this idea. I'm thinking that. It would make more sense to patent an idea, and then sell the patent to a company that already has a business in place to market and distribute the product, rather than starting something from the ground up. It really makes more sense to approach it that way.

Selling Stuff Online / E-Commerce / Contemporary Verbiage of the Same

* * *

even though i'm making less money. i do have more time as a result, but this still feels like less time. or. it feels like it's not enough time. really. i just really hope that this. different trajectory that i'm taking actually gets me somewhere.

* * *

if i could explain my hesitance to spend any of my robinhood money it's this: like, my money is the only lifeboat i have. i can't beg other people for help. i would rather commit suicide. and i'm actually not even lying when i say that.

i would rather commit suicide than beg for help.

i'm just really sick of the non-stop difficulties that i face. it's like everything. every challenge i face forces me into some shitty ass corner. i'm hoping my shitty ass situation gets better. i'm sure it will improve, but i'm really facing shitty situations right now, and it's a fucking nightmare.

* * *

I really enjoy reading SPAM emails, but. right now. i really have no need whatsoever for no strings attached sexual encounters. even. even if these were actual offers of actual sexual encounters. that were actually. no. strings. attached.

aside from that. everything is a nightmare.

* * *

What else do I have to do?

* * *

Fermentation Apparatus
 Distillation Apparatus
Terrarium Contraption
Aquarium Contraption

* * *

Dealing with a number of difficulties at the moment. Everything is just. not very easy or straight-forward. everything is a nightmare. everything is diffuclt.

Hi,

A study found that 63 percent of people
(https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/63-percent-of-20-somethings-want-to-own-a-business.html)
in their 20s want to start a business. I think that’s great.

However, there’s a big difference between starting a business and starting
a successful business, and young people may not have the experience that
comes from years of working in a given industry to know what the signs of
trouble actually are.

I’d love to write about that for your website. I’ll put together an article
for young entrepreneurs with advice on how to turn their great idea into a
successful startup. I'd be happy to feature your website as well.

The article is completely complimentary. I have a great mentor, and I
simply want to pay it forward as much as I can.

Please let me know if you’re interested.

Thank you in advance!

Anyway. First issue is that I tried to transfer money from my Robinhood account, into my Citibank account, and I fat-fingered the transaction in the opposite direction. I sent money from my Citibank account to my Robinhood account. This is not a big deal, assuming I get paid this week.

I bought a box of envelopes, and now I can't seem to find them.

What the hell? these fucking things are jagged!

* * *



is there anything that I need to do? yes! okay. so I remember. i have to look at computers for school. i eventually bought a new one and I really like it, it's faster than my old one, and has more features and it's nice.
what the hell was it that i was thinking about? I was thinking about food, and how I don't really get enough to eat. I have been starving for over a year, and I am hungry.
is there anything that i need to do today? i checked my UTA email, but i don't think that i would have had a response over the weekend.

is there anything that I need to fucking do today? i spent most of the day goofing off. i stayed up late the previous night and I've hardly had any sleep. well. except for the fact that i slept for most of the day today. but before i slept most of the day today. i didn't have much sleep.
it's hot. and I'm tired. the Hot dog is mightier than the Kielbasa. hehehe.

the things i needed to look up were: aggregate loan limits / annual limits / and interest rate / that information turned out to be easiest to find in the master promissory note.

here's the thing. i remember reading this shit already. and the information i found was basically stuff that i really remember reading the first time / the issue was that i found it difficult to look up / shit / distractions / okay so i found the information i was looking for / and / it turned out to be information that i remember reading when i signed the master promissory note / what made me want to double check / i don't remember / some issue or another.

so i guess that turned out to be easier than I thought. so. what to do next?
i need to figure out how to find my pay stubs from work.
some of the things that
are made to be hard are
also easy to deal with when
you figure out how to deal with them.

but one thing that i found is that you can use your student loan money to purchase a computer.
So I figured out what the issue is. The easiest way to figure out what I was looking for, was to read the master promissory note.
The simplified version of the loan details. the button click. scroll around stuff. surprisingly. is actually more difficult for me to understand
I figured this out.

but I guess I tried. I did put
forth my best effort and it
didn't really pay off in the way
that I thought it would now.
and now it is something that
cost me a grip of money.

The more problems I face, the more adaptations I need to make. It's getting to be too much. sometimes. nightmare.
When I start to feel distracted. I start throwing things away.
I know how to deal with this: I have ear plugs.
what do I have to deal with? i really have to read about the student loans stuff.
Let's think. let's remember what happened today. i went to the restaurant to get something to eat, then i went to the library, it was too noisy, so, i figured i wouldn't get anything done, so i went back home, where I'm at right now.

What am I dealing with here? I tried to get stuff done at the library. Trying to figure out student loans is something of a headache, and requires quite a bit of concentration, but, there were just sort of a lot of distractions at the library. This is usually how it goes.

you can separate stuff you need now, from stuff you will eventually need over the following months. the now stuff you can take with you, the later stuff you can ship to yourself as needed at a later point in time.
since you make quilts you can probably ship most things in a bag, like just wrap whatever you want to ship in a quilt, put it in a bag, then ship it to your new residence.

One issue with banker boxes is that they really are kind of expensive in comparison to regular boxes. I think price vs utility can effect the way a person experiences a product.

I renewed my current lease about two months ago for another year, but for some reason I'm kind of always in panic mode. I bought banker boxes but they really aren't suitable for shipping even if decent for storage.

and you can't be the bad
one because you have been
so good to so many people.

anyway, Paul, I still haven't gotten over her after all these years. If you want to, you can meet me in Kansas, and we'll fight over her, fists only, as in: paper, scissors, rock. 
Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library & Museum, 200 S E 4th St, Abilene, KS 67410

but I guess timing is everything, as a suitor, and as a progenitor. She never said anything to me about having a Paul, ever. I was working as a fry cook, my shirts covered in grease, day after day. Only thing she ever said was, was: "I've never seen such hideous shirts!"

there were other opportunities at the time, in fact, Ferdinand Marcos was offering a one way ticket to the bourgeoisie, fully funded by California Boy Ronald Regan himself! I couldn't do it though: my dick was just too fucking big! So, I went to Stalingrad instead!

then there were the times
that we went over to the 
side of the road to see the
roadside flowers and they
turned out to be very nice.

but um, I didn't know she met someone. Five kids? Lucky guy. Unfortunately for me, I was fighting the Wehrmacht in Stalingrad while Pretty Boy Pablo was flirting with the ladies!

Is being charged with a DUI the same as being credited with a DUI? I wonder if he'll ultimately be debited with a DUI? Do you have to be credited with a DUI before being Debited with a DUI? I've never had a DUI.

A Twitter catfish posts risqué photographs and 
actual perverts ask to meet up, sad truth:

No two days are alike
and every day brings new 
surprises and uncertainties.
Residents from the complex are

and once things are digital,

they're never forgotten:

reading these.

think about new things
to think about and new
thoughts that do not 
bore you to death.

I'm watching the ceiling fan
spin around and waft hot and

well, I made it almost as far as Oklahoma City, OK. I don't think I'll make it to Abilene, KS. Let's just say you win, Paul, and you can keep Nancy! As for paper📜scissors ✂️rock 🥌, see attachment below: Rock!

innocuous post 39
What's up? Well. I bought a few lottery tickets. Not in the bizzare way i thought of and mentioned in a previous post. What i did was buy 5 near my apartment. And 3 near my work. And that's it. Buying lottery tickets has always seemed like a silly thing to do. I never win. Not the jackpot anyway.

Buying lottery tickets. Trying to get published. Both of these things seem like silly ideas to me. And neither of them have ever really worked.

I have this funny idea for a series of poems though.

stuff that
was really coll [cool] and
this is where you are

are you wearing panties right now?
because it smells nicer in here
that it does in any other place
i've ever been in my entire life.

the two straddles the following counties
caldwell county
clinton county
dekalb county
daviess county
but I wonder if I'm using the word 
straddles correctly? do you think
that I should be using the word BUTTER?
I WON'T USE THE WORD BUTTER!

Relocation:
I'm always prepared to relocate on short notice. I keep enough money on hand to pay early lease / utility termination fees. I keep things boxed intending to mail them to any potential new residential location.

I'm aware of the difference between patents and copyrights, but there isn't a LinkedIn section that allows me to list Copyrights, or Trademarks.
I think that LinkedIn should have a generalized Registered Intellectual Property Section.
the stuff you need now, you can take with you, and it won't cost anything above what you're already spending getting to your new place: whatever you're currently spending on gas or plane tickets.

you can separate stuff you need now, from stuff you will eventually need over the following months. the now stuff you can take with you, the later stuff you can ship to yourself as needed at a later point in time.

since you make quilts you can probably ship most things in a bag, like just wrap whatever you want to ship in a quilt, put it in a bag, then ship it to your new residence.

yeah, honestly, i'd just sell everything and buy new stuff when you get to your new city.
and think about this: since you are such an amazing craftswoman, you can probably get an Etsy premium, or creative-unique-cool-stuff premium for your stuff. and then just make new stuff when you get to your new place.

but in some ways. the easiest thing to do: it might be easiest just to sell whatever you aren't really emotionally attached to, and buy new stuff online using your new residence as the ship-to location
anyway, i don't know if you have any Danish Cookie scented quilts. or anything. but um. there might be a premium attached to that. i'd buy one, but i didn't see an OnlyFans link on your linktree.

there was something strange
going on in that place some of
the people were a total nightmare
and they were all the best people

the first idea is that i might keep the things i write unpublished on my blog, or anywhere else, for a while. copyright whatever i have once i'm sure i'm finished with it, then try to sell the work with the copyright to publishers.
the second idea is to take a few pieces that i have and see if there is any interest in funding me or offering an advance on a book of 100 or so poems. i just don't know how any of this works.

Emperor Seleucus I said tax credits would be granted to any infrastructure spending by Prince Antiochus I, provided he inflate his reported expenses by no more than 9% of actual costs incurred, and to seek assistance from his cousin Pharaoh Ptolemy II concerning other expenses.

Vladimir Putin I the Mediocre compares himself to Tsar Peter I the Great? Well, he already tried comparing Himself to Basileus Constantine I the Great, however, Vladimir Putin the Mediocre's reunification efforts have fallen short. The Hot Dog is mightier than the Keilbasa!

the third idea is to approach literary agents, or whatever, rather than publishers directly. i don't know how that works either.
i have plenty of stamps.

the last approach that i took was the one i had been doing for years. submit my poems to magazines and see if they could get published, and then. i guess, at that point approach publishers or agents with some kind of accomplishments that would give them a reason to work with me.

sometimes i feel sad. but it's kind of on and off. sometimes i get bored. sometimes. and sometimes it's on and off.
my mood isn't exactly up or down right now. i remember in elementary school i went to some kind of math summer school, and one guy referred to something that happened as "Bunk" and I had to ask what he meant by that, and he said "up or down." like the word "bunk" meant "up or down" or something. 
i don't mean that my mood is bunk. i just mean that i'm not happy, really, or unhappy. not at this exact moment or anything.

Here were a few ideas that i have about trying this whole writing thing again. like fucking again. i thought i wrote this whole bull-shit writer crap off years. fucking years ago. that two years spent like half a decade ago was. i really think. the last time i took writing serious. i have a few ideas though, and, maybe this time it might work out.
the first idea is that i might keep the things i write unpublished on my blog, or anywhere else, for a while. copyright whatever i have once i'm sure i'm finished with it, then try to sell the work with the copyright to publishers.
the second idea is to take a few pieces that i have and see if there is any interest in funding me or offering an advance on a book of 100 or so poems. i just don't know how any of this works.
the third idea is to approach literary agents, or whatever, rather than publishers directly. i don't know how that works either.
i have plenty of stamps.
the last approach that i took was the one i had been doing for years. submit my poems to magazines and see if they could get published, and then. i guess, at that point approach publishers or agents with some kind of accomplishments that would give them a reason to work with me.

it's almost the end of my work week. yesterday was actually pretty nice, there wasn't much downtime and i stayed busy the entire shift. but at one point it was clear that one of my co-workers was intentionally trying to aggravate me. i argued with him briefly, but i realized it was easier to tell him to find someone else to work with. i was already wrapping up my task, i didn't need his help, and he didn't need to loiter near me if we were going to have trouble getting along.

However. There would only be the potential of overlap of shifts one day a week. I have 1 specific 2nd job in mind. And it's the one I'm trying to work out in my head.

My current job and the potential second job are on opposite sides of FT Worth, this isn't necessarily a problem because I live in Arlington, it's in the middle of these two locations.

in addition to all of that: I'm also going to file a patent for the box that the envelopes are sold in, and the patent is going to be filed as: Danish Cookie Flavored Envelope Scented Boxes.

just to make sure i was using the word innocuous correctly, i looked the word up in the dictionary and came across the word:
anodyne
what i've concluded from the definitions of the two words is that anodyne is different from innocuous in that it refers to intentionally, or deliberately being innocuous.

I'm always prepared to relocate on short notice. I keep enough money on hand to pay early lease / utility termination fees. I keep things boxed intending to mail them to any potential new residential location.

i dont know what to do. im just kind of not happy. i dont. know. what would help me out.

what's on my mind?

i don't understand it.

okay. so what i want to know is. how does an emphasis. so. how does the individualized projects / team projects dichotomy reconcile itself with the work from home (WFH) / return to the office (RTO) dichotomy? and. i'm not trying to suggest.

anyway. i think that i've come with a solution to. like. how to respond. to any kind of. anyway. i'm not really going to worry about this for now because. i'm really not in that line of work anyway. and i have no intention of pursuing that line of work.

when i think about this. i just really don't want to suggest anything. i don't want to bring up anything that could. like. challenge the work from home (WFH) movement. i don't really want to say anything that would suggest that i'm anti-work-from-home, or anything. because.

and then, let's suppose hybrid-work environments. how do you hybridize individualized projects and team projects? what is the industry jargon for hybridized individualized collaboration work?

okay. i'll just take a position. if the team is the be all and end all of a project, then (RTO) would be optimal, wouldn't it? because you would have that additional layer of in-person collaboration that you just wouldn't get from tele-conferencing.

okay. so here. i have an idea for the. well. here's the thing. there are arguments for both sides of the return to the office (RTO) / work from home (WFH) argument.

one issue. one idea is that the (WFH) movement is a conspiracy on the part of the collaboration software industrial complex, how do we know this: cui bono! and, you could also say that, anyone who returns to the office (RTO) is, by definition, a team player, even if the person is a total introvert.

honestly, what side am i on? honestly: cui bono! i benefit most from (WFH) because i really don't like traffic. like really. why is there so much traffic. it's a car maker conspiracy! yeah. that's full disclosure.

and. yeah. that was really more thinking than i wanted to do after reading a short tweet and a few supporting tweets. 

i want to say that. i'm probably going to stay off of twitter for the time being.

i'm fucking tired.

alright. i'm feeling better. but. well. i wanted to say: who knows how long this will last. but. i don't want to think that way. i want to think. things are okay right now. and i'm sure they'll get better. i'm sure that things will continue to improve.

...











I'm in fucking Nashville.
it's a constant recalibration of what i need to do. filing for unemployment is a total waste of time. filing an unemployment insurance claim is a total waste of time. my claim never gets approved. nightmare. so what the hell do i do?

There is an issue of. i need to have enough student loan money to cover living expenses. i really don't want to resort to taking out private fucking student loans.

this is a nightmare. i think that i'll either. i think that i'll file the unemployment claim. and the disability claim.

i'm looking at my electricity bill. 55 fucking kilowatt hours! 10 dollars and 55 fucking cents. i'm home all the time now. so. i just have to figure out what the hell to do over the next few. hell. there really is no telling how long this is going to take. to find work.

if i do have to relocate. yeah. i don't really know.

i don't know if i should file an additional unemployment claim or what.

large butts. are part of the large butt industrial complex. small butts. are part of the small butt industrial complex. there are different industries. and there are different industrial complexes. that's just more or less the way that it is. that is more or less the way that it goes. there is something that i was thinking about.

sometimes designs put us at odds with one another. sometimes designs intentionally put us at odds with one another. i get that quiet spaces are needed. i remember. i found it difficult to accept a work from home position. because. me neighborhood was just too noisy at the time. it was hard to accept calls. it was hard to concentrate on work. it was hard to focus. sometimes it can be hard to focus. sometimes it can be hard to get things done when it's noisy. does it really enhance your concentration. well. who know. i do. i really do need to make a living. and. right now. i just don't think that i can do that. 

i think. it's a conspiracy on the part of the sell things industrial complex. i think that it's part of the industrial goods industrial complex. you have a problem. and we have the solution. i do not want all old things. i want all new things. i don't want a single new thing. i want all old things. i do not want anything other than high prices antiques that are sold by the most respectable antique dealers. and that's the only thing that i want. antiques. antiques. respectable. respectable. 

i remember. there were a few times when i worked in an office setting. and. it was noisy. and. in those cases. i was the noisy one.

i'm trying to compile my posts for Letters from Sanford Street. and this is the kind of thing that will take some time. what else was i trying to do? well. there was something that i needed to work on, but for some reason. it seems to have slipped my mind. i don't know how to deal with this kind of thing. it's possible that. he might just be trying to get an interview done or something. i have no idea. but he just left. and now this is easier.

i get. i understand that we don't always have our own private work spaces. we don't all have our own offices. and. these quite spaces are really needed. i get that.

part of the reason that i do conduct business. i do work from home when as far as work pertains to Chestnut + Hazel. is because i really don't have money for an office. not right now. any maybe the work from home thing does come with opportunities that can change things.

i think about the people who started businesses in their dorm room. or people who started businesses in their garage.

it doesn't take long for quiet spaces to become loud spaces. quiet spaces. everyone needs them. i think this guy is from the walking advertisement industrial complex.

i have to look for something. i have to look for a position. not because i need the money, but because it's relevant to what i want to accomplish. but the only think i really want to accomplish is to have more money.

i liquidated nearly everything in my robinhood account. i don't think that i would have ever done that. really. i thought that i would just be able to hold down a job. but i actually can't. i can't hold down a job. everyone picks on me. and this is true no matter where i work.

i have to think about what my next moves are. because this is a nightmare. i don't know if i'll be able to find work. or what. or what kind of work or employment i should be looking for.

alright. well I guess that's over. what a total nightmare. but right now. i really don't know what to do for work.

it wasn't too far back that i really felt that things were getting better. but they continue to be a disaster. what the hell do i need to do.

These last few days have been extremely challenging for me. Everything feels like a kind of sensation overload, and I have to look for work, again.

make a reference to the original. make an attribution. and make a contribution by making a slight change.

think about the original sin of mankind. make a slight change. then make a contribution of your own. you'll have fun. but this assertion is not guaranteed.

have you ever tasted how so many things taste similar to one another. this one iPhone had a very similar taste to this generic smart phone i was licking earlier. can you taste the difference? i couldn't! i'm embarrassed and i feel like i have no taste.

maybe we can collect all of the artifacts that the people all over the universe are collecting. if others collect them. then we too should collect them. in many ways. this is a good thing. in other ways. it's something other than a good thing.

there is an ongoing twitter conflict between the freudians and the hubbardians. this sort of thing will never end. is it all in your mind. or is it all in your head. this debate will never end.

orange juice is made from squeezed oranges. lemonade is made from squeeze lemons.

there really is no such thing as a free lunch. but these tweet is free. 

eat my tweet.

i met a man from an antique land who said. that upon his ball sack. these cock rings appear.

i told him it's wrong to use a cock ring for his ball sack. it's better to use a ball ring.

what color are your balls. well. you wouldn't know unless you opened your scrotum and checked.

and don't think you can trick me by painting your balls. or dying them red. neptune is an even bluer big ball with a ball ring.

sputnik was the first man made ball of steel to circle an even greener. and even bluer ball. the earth is a big blue ball.

think of the white ball. and think of the red ball. tonight. we dine at the pub. tonight we play pool.

balls. inside of an even bigger. translucent ball. and your balls are numbered. 

because we're playing bingo. what did you think we were doing.
balls. inside of a netted sack.
i think. therefore. that these are onions.

and on that pedestal. 
massive stone balls appear.

and on those pedestals. these massive stone balls appear.
do they have names. I don't think they do.
i think. i don't really know. spam. maybe. ham. maybe. green apples and spam. what do you think.

large balls. stone balls. concrete spheres mounted on cubes outside of city hall.
everything is a headache. and everything else is a nightmare.
but everything is kind of uncertain. onions and maybe some kind of sauce.
pencils and pens and notebooks. a laptop a tablet. maybe a new phone.

pencils and pens and notebooks. a laptop a tablet. maybe a new phone.
well. i guess she's off the market now. and i guess its no skin off my cock.
she said something about the beach and a fish net g string and a large otter. and sand. it gets everywhere. even a woman's crotch. and even a one as unbelievably tight as it gets.

well. um. if you want to know the truth. i'm actually part of the team investigating you know who. and. it. um. it honestly felt like she had sand in her crotch. fine grain sand. gently abrasive. good. but still. she had a sand crotch.


I think of iteration in engineering
as being similar to evolution in biology
one benefit to smaller teams and individualized
development projects is that the the iterations
can progress in isolation, and the products created
iterate divergent from a kind of mainstream,

alright. done. i really didn't give the computer shopping thing too much thought. or time. but i need to also look at laptop computers. i think during this search. i focused on tablet computers.

is there anything that I need to do? yes! okay. so I remember. i have to look at computers for school. i eventually bought a new one and I really like it, it's faster than my old one, and has more features and it's nice.
what the hell was it that i was thinking about? I was thinking about food, and how I don't really get enough to eat. I have been starving for over a year, and I am hungry.
is there anything that i need to do today? i checked my UTA email, but i don't think that i would have had a response over the weekend.

is there anything that I need to fucking do today? i spent most of the day goofing off. i stayed up late the previous night and I've hardly had any sleep. well. except for the fact that i slept for most of the day today. but before i slept most of the day today. i didn't have much sleep.
it's hot. and I'm tired. the Hot dog is mightier than the Kielbasa. hehehe.

the things i needed to look up were: aggregate loan limits / annual limits / and interest rate / that information turned out to be easiest to find in the master promissory note.

here's the thing. i remember reading this shit already. and the information i found was basically stuff that i really remember reading the first time / the issue was that i found it difficult to look up / shit / distractions / okay so i found the information i was looking for / and / it turned out to be information that i remember reading when i signed the master promissory note / what made me want to double check / i don't remember / some issue or another.

so i guess that turned out to be easier than I thought. so. what to do next?
i need to figure out how to find my pay stubs from work.
some of the things that
are made to be hard are
also easy to deal with when
you figure out how to deal with them.

but one thing that i found is that you can use your student loan money to purchase a computer.
So I figured out what the issue is. The easiest way to figure out what I was looking for, was to read the master promissory note.
The simplified version of the loan details. the button click. scroll around stuff. surprisingly. is actually more difficult for me to understand
I figured this out.

but I guess I tried. I did put
forth my best effort and it
didn't really pay off in the way
that I thought it would now.
and now it is something that
cost me a grip of money.

The more problems I face, the more adaptations I need to make. It's getting to be too much. sometimes. nightmare.
When I start to feel distracted. I start throwing things away.
I know how to deal with this: I have ear plugs.
what do I have to deal with? i really have to read about the student loans stuff.
Let's think. let's remember what happened today. i went to the restaurant to get something to eat, then i went to the library, it was too noisy, so, i figured i wouldn't get anything done, so i went back home, where I'm at right now.

What am I dealing with here? I tried to get stuff done at the library. Trying to figure out student loans is something of a headache, and requires quite a bit of concentration, but, there were just sort of a lot of distractions at the library. This is usually how it goes.

you can separate stuff you need now, from stuff you will eventually need over the following months. the now stuff you can take with you, the later stuff you can ship to yourself as needed at a later point in time.
since you make quilts you can probably ship most things in a bag, like just wrap whatever you want to ship in a quilt, put it in a bag, then ship it to your new residence.

One issue with banker boxes is that they really are kind of expensive in comparison to regular boxes. I think price vs utility can effect the way a person experiences a product.

I renewed my current lease about two months ago for another year, but for some reason I'm kind of always in panic mode. I bought banker boxes but they really aren't suitable for shipping even if decent for storage.

and you can't be the bad
one because you have been
so good to so many people.

Relocation:
I renewed my current lease about two months ago for another year, but for some reason I'm kind of always in panic mode. I bought banker boxes but they really aren't suitable for shipping even if decent for storage.

you ended up in a new town.
you ended up in a new city

What's up? Well. I bought a few lottery tickets. Not in the bizzare way i thought of and mentioned in a previous post. What i did was buy 5 near my apartment. And 3 near my work. And that's it. Buying lottery tickets has always seemed like a silly thing to do. I never win. Not the jackpot anyway.

Buying lottery tickets. Trying to get published. Both of these things seem like silly ideas to me. And neither of them have ever really worked.

I have this funny idea for a series of poems though.

i thought
of different

stuff that
was really coll [cool] and
this is where you are

are you wearing panties right now?
because it smells nicer in here
that it does in any other place
i've ever been in my entire life.

the two straddles the following counties
caldwell county
clinton county
dekalb county
daviess county
but I wonder if I'm using the word 
straddles correctly? do you think
that I should be using the word BUTTER?
I WON'T USE THE WORD BUTTER!

Relocation:
I'm always prepared to relocate on short notice. I keep enough money on hand to pay early lease / utility termination fees. I keep things boxed intending to mail them to any potential new residential location.

I'm aware of the difference between patents and copyrights, but there isn't a LinkedIn section that allows me to list Copyrights, or Trademarks.
I think that LinkedIn should have a generalized Registered Intellectual Property Section.
the stuff you need now, you can take with you, and it won't cost anything above what you're already spending getting to your new place: whatever you're currently spending on gas or plane tickets.

you can separate stuff you need now, from stuff you will eventually need over the following months. the now stuff you can take with you, the later stuff you can ship to yourself as needed at a later point in time.

since you make quilts you can probably ship most things in a bag, like just wrap whatever you want to ship in a quilt, put it in a bag, then ship it to your new residence.
Relocation:
One issue with banker boxes is that they really are kind of expensive in comparison to regular boxes. I think price vs utility can effect the way a person experiences a product.
yeah, honestly, i'd just sell everything and buy new stuff when you get to your new city.
and think about this: since you are such an amazing craftswoman, you can probably get an Etsy premium, or creative-unique-cool-stuff premium for your stuff. and then just make new stuff when you get to your new place.

but in some ways. the easiest thing to do: it might be easiest just to sell whatever you aren't really emotionally attached to, and buy new stuff online using your new residence as the ship-to location
anyway, i don't know if you have any Danish Cookie scented quilts. or anything. but um. there might be a premium attached to that. i'd buy one, but i didn't see an OnlyFans link on your linktree.

there was something strange
going on in that place some of
the people were a total nightmare
and they were all the best people
most of them anyway.

and this is kind of why i'm somewhat insensitive to current events. there was actually a spike in mass shootings in the DFW area at gentlemen's clubs, and, i feel like i'm the only person who followed the issue.

in addition to all of that: I'm also going to file a patent for the box that the envelopes are sold in, and the patent is going to be filed as: Danish Cookie Flavored Envelope Scented Boxes.

the first idea is that i might keep the things i write unpublished on my blog, or anywhere else, for a while. copyright whatever i have once i'm sure i'm finished with it, then try to sell the work with the copyright to publishers.
the second idea is to take a few pieces that i have and see if there is any interest in funding me or offering an advance on a book of 100 or so poems. i just don't know how any of this works.

i went to walmart and bought 13 bottles of diet pepsi in the 2 liter size, and a bottle of dole lemonade in the 2 liter size. i also bought a box of white chocolate macadamia cookies.
and this is probably where this blog. devolves. into a daily list of the exact things i did for any particular day.
maybe it doesn't devolve in that direction. maybe it just changes.

do i really need another desk? i don't think so. i want to get started on this writing crap. i just don't know. once. once i get started. the rest should be kind of easy. i think. i remember writing a series of poems based on someone else's series of poems. and it didn't take long to do. but i really don't think. i'm really not sure if my series was really all that spectacular.
writing a series of poems based on someone else's series of poems was easy. the conceptual part. the thinking part was out of the way. she already did that. my part was just to understand what she was saying, and say it my way.
it's kind of like. painting a painting based on someone else's painting.
I wish life were easier. Now. Shoes. So i talked with this shoe repair guy and he said 25 bucks for heel replacement. But did he mean per heel? Or per pair? So i have five shoes in need of heel replacement. Im hoping that it would only cost 65 dollars for all of them. And my mom. My mom is back thank fucking god.

i may have to make some revisions to my. i guess. total online presence. social media and whatever else. i was going to start with pinterest. i turns out i have a different pinterest on my computer. and a different pinterest on my phone.
just to make sure i was using the word innocuous correctly, i looked the word up in the dictionary and came across the word:
anodyne
what i've concluded from the definitions of the two words is that anodyne is different from innocuous in that it refers to intentionally, or deliberately being innocuous.

I'm at the buffet. Eating. Well. Of course I'm eating. I have to check again about the second job stuff. But there are potential issues that may come up if overtime is required at either job. However. There would only be the potential of overlap of shifts one day a week. I have 1 specific 2nd job in mind. And it's the one I'm trying to work out in my head.
My current job and the potential second job are on opposite sides of FT Worth, this isn't necessarily a problem because I live in Arlington, it's in the middle of these two locations.

sometimes i feel sad. but it's kind of on and off. sometimes i get bored. sometimes. and sometimes it's on and off.
my mood isn't exactly up or down right now. i remember in elementary school i went to some kind of math summer school, and one guy referred to something that happened as "Bunk" and I had to ask what he meant by that, and he said "up or down." like the word "bunk" meant "up or down" or something. 
i don't mean that my mood is bunk. i just mean that i'm not happy, really, or unhappy. not at this exact moment or anything.

Here were a few ideas that i have about trying this whole writing thing again. like fucking again. i thought i wrote this whole bull-shit writer crap off years. fucking years ago. that two years spent like half a decade ago was. i really think. the last time i took writing serious. i have a few ideas though, and, maybe this time it might work out.
the first idea is that i might keep the things i write unpublished on my blog, or anywhere else, for a while. copyright whatever i have once i'm sure i'm finished with it, then try to sell the work with the copyright to publishers.
the second idea is to take a few pieces that i have and see if there is any interest in funding me or offering an advance on a book of 100 or so poems. i just don't know how any of this works.
the third idea is to approach literary agents, or whatever, rather than publishers directly. i don't know how that works either.
i have plenty of stamps.
the last approach that i took was the one i had been doing for years. submit my poems to magazines and see if they could get published, and then. i guess, at that point approach publishers or agents with some kind of accomplishments that would give them a reason to work with me.

it's almost the end of my work week. yesterday was actually pretty nice, there wasn't much downtime and i stayed busy the entire shift. but at one point it was clear that one of my co-workers was intentionally trying to aggravate me. i argued with him briefly, but i realized it was easier to tell him to find someone else to work with. i was already wrapping up my task, i didn't need his help, and he didn't need to loiter near me if we were going to have trouble getting along.

what's going on? im just stressed and unhappy. it's the same thing over and over again. i dont know what to do about this. i really dont.

i dont know what to do. im just kind of not happy. i dont. know. what would help me out.

what's on my mind?

i don't understand it.

okay. so what i want to know is. how does an emphasis. so. how does the individualized projects / team projects dichotomy reconcile itself with the work from home (WFH) / return to the office (RTO) dichotomy? and. i'm not trying to suggest.

anyway. i think that i've come with a solution to. like. how to respond. to any kind of. anyway. i'm not really going to worry about this for now because. i'm really not in that line of work anyway. and i have no intention of pursuing that line of work.

when i think about this. i just really don't want to suggest anything. i don't want to bring up anything that could. like. challenge the work from home (WFH) movement. i don't really want to say anything that would suggest that i'm anti-work-from-home, or anything. because.

and then, let's suppose hybrid-work environments. how do you hybridize individualized projects and team projects? what is the industry jargon for hybridized individualized collaboration work?

okay. i'll just take a position. if the team is the be all and end all of a project, then (RTO) would be optimal, wouldn't it? because you would have that additional layer of in-person collaboration that you just wouldn't get from tele-conferencing.

okay. so here. i have an idea for the. well. here's the thing. there are arguments for both sides of the return to the office (RTO) / work from home (WFH) argument.

one issue. one idea is that the (WFH) movement is a conspiracy on the part of the collaboration software industrial complex, how do we know this: cui bono! and, you could also say that, anyone who returns to the office (RTO) is, by definition, a team player, even if the person is a total introvert.

honestly, what side am i on? honestly: cui bono! i benefit most from (WFH) because i really don't like traffic. like really. why is there so much traffic. it's a car maker conspiracy! yeah. that's full disclosure.

and. yeah. that was really more thinking than i wanted to do after reading a short tweet and a few supporting tweets. 

i want to say that. i'm probably going to stay off of twitter for the time being.

i'm fucking tired.

alright. i'm feeling better. but. well. i wanted to say: who knows how long this will last. but. i don't want to think that way. i want to think. things are okay right now. and i'm sure they'll get better. i'm sure that things will continue to improve.

I'm in fucking Nashville.

* * *

it's a constant recalibration of what i need to do. filing for unemployment is a total waste of time. filing an unemployment insurance claim is a total waste of time. my claim never gets approved. nightmare. so what the hell do i do?

* * *

There is an issue of. i need to have enough student loan money to cover living expenses. i really don't want to resort to taking out private fucking student loans.

* * *

this is a nightmare. i think that i'll either. i think that i'll file the unemployment claim. and the disability claim.

i'm looking at my electricity bill. 55 fucking kilowatt hours! 10 dollars and 55 fucking cents. i'm home all the time now. so. i just have to figure out what the hell to do over the next few. hell. there really is no telling how long this is going to take. to find work.

if i do have to relocate. yeah. i don't really know.

* * *

i don't know if i should file an additional unemployment claim or what.

* * *

large butts. are part of the large butt industrial complex. small butts. are part of the small butt industrial complex. there are different industries. and there are different industrial complexes. that's just more or less the way that it is. that is more or less the way that it goes. there is something that i was thinking about.

* * *

sometimes designs put us at odds with one another. sometimes designs intentionally put us at odds with one another. i get that quiet spaces are needed. i remember. i found it difficult to accept a work from home position. because. me neighborhood was just too noisy at the time. it was hard to accept calls. it was hard to concentrate on work. it was hard to focus. sometimes it can be hard to focus. sometimes it can be hard to get things done when it's noisy. does it really enhance your concentration. well. who know. i do. i really do need to make a living. and. right now. i just don't think that i can do that. 

i think. it's a conspiracy on the part of the sell things industrial complex. i think that it's part of the industrial goods industrial complex. you have a problem. and we have the solution. i do not want all old things. i want all new things. i don't want a single new thing. i want all old things. i do not want anything other than high prices antiques that are sold by the most respectable antique dealers. and that's the only thing that i want. antiques. antiques. respectable. respectable. 

i remember. there were a few times when i worked in an office setting. and. it was noisy. and. in those cases. i was the noisy one.

* * *

i'm trying to compile my posts for Letters from Sanford Street. and this is the kind of thing that will take some time. what else was i trying to do? well. there was something that i needed to work on, but for some reason. it seems to have slipped my mind. i don't know how to deal with this kind of thing. it's possible that. he might just be trying to get an interview done or something. i have no idea. but he just left. and now this is easier.

i get. i understand that we don't always have our own private work spaces. we don't all have our own offices. and. these quite spaces are really needed. i get that.

part of the reason that i do conduct business. i do work from home when as far as work pertains to Chestnut + Hazel. is because i really don't have money for an office. not right now. any maybe the work from home thing does come with opportunities that can change things.

i think about the people who started businesses in their dorm room. or people who started businesses in their garage.

* * *

it doesn't take long for quiet spaces to become loud spaces. quiet spaces. everyone needs them. i think this guy is from the walking advertisement industrial complex.

* * *

i have to look for something. i have to look for a position. not because i need the money, but because it's relevant to what i want to accomplish. but the only think i really want to accomplish is to have more money.

* * *

i liquidated nearly everything in my robinhood account. i don't think that i would have ever done that. really. i thought that i would just be able to hold down a job. but i actually can't. i can't hold down a job. everyone picks on me. and this is true no matter where i work.

i have to think about what my next moves are. because this is a nightmare. i don't know if i'll be able to find work. or what. or what kind of work or employment i should be looking for.

* * *

alright. well I guess that's over. what a total nightmare. but right now. i really don't know what to do for work.

* * *

it wasn't too far back that i really felt that things were getting better. but they continue to be a disaster. what the hell do i need to do.

* * *

These last few days have been extremely challenging for me. Everything feels like a kind of sensation overload, and I have to look for work, again.

alright. done. i really didn't give the computer shopping thing too much thought. or time. but i need to also look at laptop computers. i think during this search. i focused on tablet computers.

is there anything that I need to do? yes! okay. so I remember. i have to look at computers for school. i eventually bought a new one and I really like it, it's faster than my old one, and has more features and it's nice.
what the hell was it that i was thinking about? I was thinking about food, and how I don't really get enough to eat. I have been starving for over a year, and I am hungry.
is there anything that i need to do today? i checked my UTA email, but i don't think that i would have had a response over the weekend.

is there anything that I need to fucking do today? i spent most of the day goofing off. i stayed up late the previous night and I've hardly had any sleep. well. except for the fact that i slept for most of the day today. but before i slept most of the day today. i didn't have much sleep.
it's hot. and I'm tired. the Hot dog is mightier than the Kielbasa. hehehe.

the things i needed to look up were: aggregate loan limits / annual limits / and interest rate / that information turned out to be easiest to find in the master promissory note.

here's the thing. i remember reading this shit already. and the information i found was basically stuff that i really remember reading the first time / the issue was that i found it difficult to look up / shit / distractions / okay so i found the information i was looking for / and / it turned out to be information that i remember reading when i signed the master promissory note / what made me want to double check / i don't remember / some issue or another.

so i guess that turned out to be easier than I thought. so. what to do next?
i need to figure out how to find my pay stubs from work.
some of the things that
are made to be hard are
also easy to deal with when
you figure out how to deal with them.

but one thing that i found is that you can use your student loan money to purchase a computer.
So I figured out what the issue is. The easiest way to figure out what I was looking for, was to read the master promissory note.
The simplified version of the loan details. the button click. scroll around stuff. surprisingly. is actually more difficult for me to understand
I figured this out.

but I guess I tried. I did put
forth my best effort and it
didn't really pay off in the way
that I thought it would now.
and now it is something that
cost me a grip of money.

The more problems I face, the more adaptations I need to make. It's getting to be too much. sometimes. nightmare.
When I start to feel distracted. I start throwing things away.
I know how to deal with this: I have ear plugs.
what do I have to deal with? i really have to read about the student loans stuff.
Let's think. let's remember what happened today. i went to the restaurant to get something to eat, then i went to the library, it was too noisy, so, i figured i wouldn't get anything done, so i went back home, where I'm at right now.

What am I dealing with here? I tried to get stuff done at the library. Trying to figure out student loans is something of a headache, and requires quite a bit of concentration, but, there were just sort of a lot of distractions at the library. This is usually how it goes.

you can separate stuff you need now, from stuff you will eventually need over the following months. the now stuff you can take with you, the later stuff you can ship to yourself as needed at a later point in time.
since you make quilts you can probably ship most things in a bag, like just wrap whatever you want to ship in a quilt, put it in a bag, then ship it to your new residence.

One issue with banker boxes is that they really are kind of expensive in comparison to regular boxes. I think price vs utility can effect the way a person experiences a product.

I renewed my current lease about two months ago for another year, but for some reason I'm kind of always in panic mode. I bought banker boxes but they really aren't suitable for shipping even if decent for storage.

and you can't be the bad
one because you have been
so good to so many people.

anyway, Paul, I still haven't gotten over her after all these years. If you want to, you can meet me in Kansas, and we'll fight over her, fists only, as in: paper, scissors, rock. 
Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library & Museum, 200 S E 4th St, Abilene, KS 67410

but I guess timing is everything, as a suitor, and as a progenitor. She never said anything to me about having a Paul, ever. I was working as a fry cook, my shirts covered in grease, day after day. Only thing she ever said was, was: "I've never seen such hideous shirts!"

there were other opportunities at the time, in fact, Ferdinand Marcos was offering a one way ticket to the bourgeoisie, fully funded by California Boy Ronald Regan himself! I couldn't do it though: my dick was just too fucking big! So, I went to Stalingrad instead!

then there were the times
that we went over to the 
side of the road to see the
roadside flowers and they
turned out to be very nice.

but um, I didn't know she met someone. Five kids? Lucky guy. Unfortunately for me, I was fighting the Wehrmacht in Stalingrad while Pretty Boy Pablo was flirting with the ladies!

Is being charged with a DUI the same as being credited with a DUI? I wonder if he'll ultimately be debited with a DUI? Do you have to be credited with a DUI before being Debited with a DUI? I've never had a DUI.

What's up? Well. I bought a few lottery tickets. Not in the bizzare way i thought of and mentioned in a previous post. What i did was buy 5 near my apartment. And 3 near my work. And that's it. Buying lottery tickets has always seemed like a silly thing to do. I never win. Not the jackpot anyway.

Buying lottery tickets. Trying to get published. Both of these things seem like silly ideas to me. And neither of them have ever really worked.

I have this funny idea for a series of poems though.

I WON'T USE THE WORD BUTTER!

Relocation:
I'm always prepared to relocate on short notice. I keep enough money on hand to pay early lease / utility termination fees. I keep things boxed intending to mail them to any potential new residential location.

I'm aware of the difference between patents and copyrights, but there isn't a LinkedIn section that allows me to list Copyrights, or Trademarks.
I think that LinkedIn should have a generalized Registered Intellectual Property Section.
the stuff you need now, you can take with you, and it won't cost anything above what you're already spending getting to your new place: whatever you're currently spending on gas or plane tickets.

you can separate stuff you need now, from stuff you will eventually need over the following months. the now stuff you can take with you, the later stuff you can ship to yourself as needed at a later point in time.

since you make quilts you can probably ship most things in a bag, like just wrap whatever you want to ship in a quilt, put it in a bag, then ship it to your new residence.

yeah, honestly, i'd just sell everything and buy new stuff when you get to your new city.
and think about this: since you are such an amazing craftswoman, you can probably get an Etsy premium, or creative-unique-cool-stuff premium for your stuff. and then just make new stuff when you get to your new place.

but in some ways. the easiest thing to do: it might be easiest just to sell whatever you aren't really emotionally attached to, and buy new stuff online using your new residence as the ship-to location
anyway, i don't know if you have any Danish Cookie scented quilts. or anything. but um. there might be a premium attached to that. i'd buy one, but i didn't see an OnlyFans link on your linktree.

there was something strange
going on in that place some of

and then I'm going to copyright the lyrics to song titled: "I'm sorry Ms. Jensen, I'm actually not even lying about my intentions."

in addition to all of that: I'm also going to file a patent for the box that the envelopes are sold in, and the patent is going to be filed as: Danish Cookie Flavored Envelope Scented Boxes.

Here were a few ideas that i have about trying this whole writing thing again. like fucking again. i thought i wrote this whole bull-shit writer crap off years. fucking years ago. that two years spent like half a decade ago was. i really think. the last time i took writing serious. i have a few ideas though, and, maybe this time it might work out.

the first idea is that i might keep the things i write unpublished on my blog, or anywhere else, for a while. copyright whatever i have once i'm sure i'm finished with it, then try to sell the work with the copyright to publishers.
the second idea is to take a few pieces that i have and see if there is any interest in funding me or offering an advance on a book of 100 or so poems. i just don't know how any of this works.

Emperor Seleucus I said tax credits would be granted to any infrastructure spending by Prince Antiochus I, provided he inflate his reported expenses by no more than 9% of actual costs incurred, and to seek assistance from his cousin Pharaoh Ptolemy II concerning other expenses.

Vladimir Putin I the Mediocre compares himself to Tsar Peter I the Great? Well, he already tried comparing Himself to Basileus Constantine I the Great, however, Vladimir Putin the Mediocre's reunification efforts have fallen short. The Hot Dog is mightier than the Keilbasa!

the third idea is to approach literary agents, or whatever, rather than publishers directly. i don't know how that works either.
i have plenty of stamps.

the last approach that i took was the one i had been doing for years. submit my poems to magazines and see if they could get published, and then. i guess, at that point approach publishers or agents with some kind of accomplishments that would give them a reason to work with me.

On the ride to work today there was a kind of monsoon. My windshield wipers arent that fast. And i had almost no visibility for several miles. My car is really small and light.

Find stuff to do. Nothing exacerbates a bad mood. Nothing exacerbates sadness like hanging out around the house. Like driving around town aimlessly. Like listening to sad music. Or aggressive music.

Maybe i should try doing some dating crap. I'm paid up for okcupid until january. So maybe i should do some dating. But dating is such a distraction. But what im i afraid of being distracted from? It's not like i have some amazing horseshit planned with my life.

do i really need another desk? i don't think so. i want to get started on this writing crap. i just don't know. once. once i get started. the rest should be kind of easy. i think. i remember writing a series of poems based on someone else's series of poems. and it didn't take long to do. but i really don't think. i'm really not sure if my series was really all that spectacular.
writing a series of poems based on someone else's series of poems was easy. the conceptual part. the thinking part was out of the way. she already did that. my part was just to understand what she was saying, and say it my way.
it's kind of like. painting a painting based on someone else's painting.
I wish life were easier. Now. Shoes. So i talked with this shoe repair guy and he said 25 bucks for heel replacement. But did he mean per heel? Or per pair?

just to make sure i was using the word innocuous correctly, i looked the word up in the dictionary and came across the word:
anodyne
what i've concluded from the definitions of the two words is that anodyne is different from innocuous in that it refers to intentionally, or deliberately being innocuous.

the first idea is that i might keep the things i write unpublished on my blog, or anywhere else, for a while. copyright whatever i have once i'm sure i'm finished with it, then try to sell the work with the copyright to publishers.
the second idea is to take a few pieces that i have and see if there is any interest in funding me or offering an advance on a book of 100 or so poems. i just don't know how any of this works.
the third idea is to approach literary agents, or whatever, rather than publishers directly. i don't know how that works either.

what was i thinking? the second job stuff, and the side hustle stuff. well. i put most of these ideas to the side for the minute. something came up. and i figured that i would put this other stuff to the side for a while.
if i were to sell stuff online. well. i don't really have anything to sell. other than the stuff i bought already. and really don't need.

I started using youtube music. Google play music is being sunset. Or whatever. So i had to transfer my library from one to the other. The youtube music thing has this radio aspect to it. And that's the main aspect of it. The library is secondary. The problem i have with the radio thing is that i skip tons of songs before i find something i like. Ive always used youtube for music. Or at least more for music than anything else.

Find stuff to do. Nothing exacerbates a bad mood. Nothing exacerbates sadness like hanging out around the house. Like driving around town aimlessly. Like listening to sad music. Or aggressive music.
Maybe i should try doing some dating crap. I'm paid up for okcupid until january. So maybe i should do some dating. But dating is such a distraction. But what im i afraid of being distracted from? It's not like i have some amazing horseshit planned with my life.
Right now. My issue is exactly zits. I sweat non stop in this state. I rarely use acne cream. The tube i have still has a bunch in it. But it bleaches my clothes.

What's on my mind. Well. Another day. I'm usually alone. Breaking the ice. I don't know how to explain it. For me. There's a kind of uneasiness being around other people. And there's this. Kind of a need to try to be pleasant.

So I think of the # danishcookieuxorious series as being everything from the end of # putinpullout! to this exact tweet. and i'll register a copyright for # danishcookieuxorious, and then start using some other hashtag.
and then I'm going to copyright the lyrics to song titled: "I'm sorry Ms. Jensen, I'm actually not even lying about my intentions."
in addition to all of that: I'm also going to file a patent for the box that the envelopes are sold in, and the patent is going to be filed as: Danish Cookie Flavored Envelope Scented Boxes.
and I'm also going to file a patent for an envelope called: Danish Cookie Flavored Envelopes! and these won't be self-sealing, you'll have to lick and taste these envelopes!

this is going to take a while longer
I didn't really know how long
this post really was but it was
a series of other posts with
content from around the web
from my social media profiles.

i dont know how i feel right now. Akward i guess. I did something weird at work. And im still all weirded out about it. And i dont know. How i feel. Fuck.

i may have to make some revisions to my. i guess. total online presence. social media and whatever else. i was going to start with pinterest. i turns out i have a different pinterest on my computer. and a different pinterest on my phone.
just to make sure i was using the word innocuous correctly, i looked the word up in the dictionary and came across the word:
anodyne
what i've concluded from the definitions of the two words is that anodyne is different from innocuous in that it refers to intentionally, or deliberately being innocuous.

I'm serious; I'm going to make an envelope called: Danish Cookie Scented Envelopes! What other woman in the Milky Way Galaxy will have an envelope patent named after her?
I think I just got some inspiration.

In fact, I want to clerk for Justice Sotomayor, and when I'm on the supreme court, I'll opine conservative views with more bravado than Scalia AND take Justice Sotomayor to the Ballet!

...









































































anyway. i think that i've come with a solution to. like. how to respond. to any kind of. anyway. i'm not really going to worry about this for now because. i'm really not in that line of work anyway. and i have no intention of pursuing that line of work.

when i think about this. i just really don't want to suggest anything. i don't want to bring up anything that could. like. challenge the work from home (WFH) movement. i don't really want to say anything that would suggest that i'm anti-work-from-home, or anything. because.

and then, let's suppose hybrid-work environments. how do you hybridize individualized projects and team projects? what is the industry jargon for hybridized individualized collaboration work?

okay. i'll just take a position. if the team is the be all and end all of a project, then (RTO) would be optimal, wouldn't it? because you would have that additional layer of in-person collaboration that you just wouldn't get from tele-conferencing.

okay. so here. i have an idea for the. well. here's the thing. there are arguments for both sides of the return to the office (RTO) / work from home (WFH) argument.

one issue. one idea is that the (WFH) movement is a conspiracy on the part of the collaboration software industrial complex, how do we know this: cui bono! and, you could also say that, anyone who returns to the office (RTO) is, by definition, a team player, even if the person is a total introvert.

honestly, what side am i on? honestly: cui bono! i benefit most from (WFH) because i really don't like traffic. like really. why is there so much traffic. it's a car maker conspiracy! yeah. that's full disclosure.

and. yeah. that was really more thinking than i wanted to do after reading a short tweet and a few supporting tweets. 

i want to say that. i'm probably going to stay off of twitter for the time being.

i'm fucking tired.

alright. i'm feeling better. but. well. i wanted to say: who knows how long this will last. but. i don't want to think that way. i want to think. things are okay right now. and i'm sure they'll get better. i'm sure that things will continue to improve.



this is a nightmare. i think that i'll either. i think that i'll file the unemployment claim. and the disability claim.

i'm looking at my electricity bill. 55 fucking kilowatt hours! 10 dollars and 55 fucking cents. i'm home all the time now. so. i just have to figure out what the hell to do over the next few. hell. there really is no telling how long this is going to take. to find work.

if i do have to relocate. yeah. i don't really know.

i don't know if i should file an additional unemployment claim or what.

large butts. are part of the large butt industrial complex. small butts. are part of the small butt industrial complex. there are different industries. and there are different industrial complexes. that's just more or less the way that it is. that is more or less the way that it goes. there is something that i was thinking about.

sometimes designs put us at odds with one another. sometimes designs intentionally put us at odds with one another. i get that quiet spaces are needed. i remember. i found it difficult to accept a work from home position. because. me neighborhood was just too noisy at the time. it was hard to accept calls. it was hard to concentrate on work. it was hard to focus. sometimes it can be hard to focus. sometimes it can be hard to get things done when it's noisy. does it really enhance your concentration. well. who know. i do. i really do need to make a living. and. right now. i just don't think that i can do that. 

i think. it's a conspiracy on the part of the sell things industrial complex. i think that it's part of the industrial goods industrial complex. you have a problem. and we have the solution. i do not want all old things. i want all new things. i don't want a single new thing. i want all old things. i do not want anything other than high prices antiques that are sold by the most respectable antique dealers. and that's the only thing that i want. antiques. antiques. respectable. respectable. 

i remember. there were a few times when i worked in an office setting. and. it was noisy. and. in those cases. i was the noisy one.

i'm trying to compile my posts for Letters from Sanford Street. and this is the kind of thing that will take some time. what else was i trying to do? well. there was something that i needed to work on, but for some reason. it seems to have slipped my mind. i don't know how to deal with this kind of thing. it's possible that. he might just be trying to get an interview done or something. i have no idea. but he just left. and now this is easier.

i get. i understand that we don't always have our own private work spaces. we don't all have our own offices. and. these quite spaces are really needed. i get that.

part of the reason that i do conduct business. i do work from home when as far as work pertains to Chestnut + Hazel. is because i really don't have money for an office. not right now. any maybe the work from home thing does come with opportunities that can change things.

i think about the people who started businesses in their dorm room. or people who started businesses in their garage.

it doesn't take long for quiet spaces to become loud spaces. quiet spaces. everyone needs them. i think this guy is from the walking advertisement industrial complex.

i have to look for something. i have to look for a position. not because i need the money, but because it's relevant to what i want to accomplish. but the only think i really want to accomplish is to have more money.

i liquidated nearly everything in my robinhood account. i don't think that i would have ever done that. really. i thought that i would just be able to hold down a job. but i actually can't. i can't hold down a job. everyone picks on me. and this is true no matter where i work.

i have to think about what my next moves are. because this is a nightmare. i don't know if i'll be able to find work. or what. or what kind of work or employment i should be looking for.

alright. well I guess that's over. what a total nightmare. but right now. i really don't know what to do for work.

it wasn't too far back that i really felt that things were getting better. but they continue to be a disaster. what the hell do i need to do.

These last few days have been extremely challenging for me. Everything feels like a kind of sensation overload, and I have to look for work, again.

make a reference to the original. make an attribution. and make a contribution by making a slight change.

have you ever tasted how so many things taste similar to one another. this one iPhone had a very similar taste to this generic smart phone i was licking earlier. can you taste the difference? i couldn't! i'm embarrassed and i feel like i have no taste.

maybe we can collect all of the artifacts that the people all over the universe are collecting. if others collect them. then we too should collect them. in many ways. this is a good thing. in other ways. it's something other than a good thing.

i met a man from an antique land who said. that upon his ball sack. these cock rings appear.

i told him it's wrong to use a cock ring for his ball sack. it's better to use a ball ring.

what color are your balls. well. you wouldn't know unless you opened your scrotum and checked.

and don't think you can trick me by painting your balls. or dying them red. neptune is an even bluer big ball with a ball ring.

sputnik was the first man made ball of steel to circle an even greener. and even bluer ball. the earth is a big blue ball.

think of the white ball. and think of the red ball. tonight. we dine at the pub. tonight we play pool.

balls. inside of an even bigger. translucent ball. and your balls are numbered. 

because we're playing bingo. what did you think we were doing.
balls. inside of a netted sack.
i think. therefore. that these are onions.

and on that pedestal. 
massive stone balls appear.

and on those pedestals. these massive stone balls appear.
do they have names. I don't think they do.
i think. i don't really know. spam. maybe. ham. maybe. green apples and spam. what do you think.

large balls. stone balls. concrete spheres mounted on cubes outside of city hall.
everything is a headache. and everything else is a nightmare.
but everything is kind of uncertain. onions and maybe some kind of sauce.
pencils and pens and notebooks. a laptop a tablet. maybe a new phone.

pencils and pens and notebooks. a laptop a tablet. maybe a new phone.
well. i guess she's off the market now. and i guess its no skin off my cock.
she said something about the beach and a fish net g string and a large otter. and sand. it gets everywhere. even a woman's crotch. and even a one as unbelievably tight as it gets.

well. um. if you want to know the truth. i'm actually part of the team investigating you know who. and. it. um. it honestly felt like she had sand in her crotch. fine grain sand. gently abrasive. good. but still. she had a sand crotch.


There is an issue of. i need to have enough student loan money to cover living expenses. i really don't want to resort to taking out private fucking student loans.

this is a nightmare. i think that i'll either. i think that i'll file the unemployment claim. and the disability claim.

i'm looking at my electricity bill. 55 fucking kilowatt hours! 10 dollars and 55 fucking cents. i'm home all the time now. so. i just have to figure out what the hell to do over the next few. hell. there really is no telling how long this is going to take. to find work.

if i do have to relocate. yeah. i don't really know.

i don't know if i should file an additional unemployment claim or what.

There is an issue of. i need to have enough student loan money to cover living expenses. i really don't want to resort to taking out private fucking student loans.

* * *

this is a nightmare. i think that i'll either. i think that i'll file the unemployment claim. and the disability claim.

i'm looking at my electricity bill. 55 fucking kilowatt hours! 10 dollars and 55 fucking cents. i'm home all the time now. so. i just have to figure out what the hell to do over the next few. hell. there really is no telling how long this is going to take. to find work.

if i do have to relocate. yeah. i don't really know.

* * *

i don't know if i should file an additional unemployment claim or what.

* * *

large butts. are part of the large butt industrial complex. small butts. are part of the small butt industrial complex. there are different industries. and there are different industrial complexes. that's just more or less the way that it is. that is more or less the way that it goes. there is something that i was thinking about.

* * *

sometimes designs put us at odds with one another. sometimes designs intentionally put us at odds with one another. i get that quiet spaces are needed. i remember. i found it difficult to accept a work from home position. because. me neighborhood was just too noisy at the time. it was hard to accept calls. it was hard to concentrate on work. it was hard to focus. sometimes it can be hard to focus. sometimes it can be hard to get things done when it's noisy. does it really enhance your concentration. well. who know. i do. i really do need to make a living. and. right now. i just don't think that i can do that. 

i think. it's a conspiracy on the part of the sell things industrial complex. i think that it's part of the industrial goods industrial complex. you have a problem. and we have the solution. i do not want all old things. i want all new things. i don't want a single new thing. i want all old things. i do not want anything other than high prices antiques that are sold by the most respectable antique dealers. and that's the only thing that i want. antiques. antiques. respectable. respectable. 

i remember. there were a few times when i worked in an office setting. and. it was noisy. and. in those cases. i was the noisy one.

* * *

i'm trying to compile my posts for Letters from Sanford Street. and this is the kind of thing that will take some time. what else was i trying to do? well. there was something that i needed to work on, but for some reason. it seems to have slipped my mind. i don't know how to deal with this kind of thing. it's possible that. he might just be trying to get an interview done or something. i have no idea. but he just left. and now this is easier.

i get. i understand that we don't always have our own private work spaces. we don't all have our own offices. and. these quite spaces are really needed. i get that.

part of the reason that i do conduct business. i do work from home when as far as work pertains to Chestnut + Hazel. is because i really don't have money for an office. not right now. any maybe the work from home thing does come with opportunities that can change things.

i think about the people who started businesses in their dorm room. or people who started businesses in their garage.

* * *

it doesn't take long for quiet spaces to become loud spaces. quiet spaces. everyone needs them. i think this guy is from the walking advertisement industrial complex.

* * *

i have to look for something. i have to look for a position. not because i need the money, but because it's relevant to what i want to accomplish. but the only think i really want to accomplish is to have more money.

* * *

i liquidated nearly everything in my robinhood account. i don't think that i would have ever done that. really. i thought that i would just be able to hold down a job. but i actually can't. i can't hold down a job. everyone picks on me. and this is true no matter where i work.

i have to think about what my next moves are. because this is a nightmare. i don't know if i'll be able to find work. or what. or what kind of work or employment i should be looking for.

* * *

alright. well I guess that's over. what a total nightmare. but right now. i really don't know what to do for work.

* * *

it wasn't too far back that i really felt that things were getting better. but they continue to be a disaster. what the hell do i need to do.

* * *

These last few days have been extremely challenging for me. Everything feels like a kind of sensation overload, and I have to look for work, again.

what color are your balls. well. you wouldn't know unless you opened your scrotum and checked.

and don't think you can trick me by painting your balls. or dying them red. neptune is an even bluer big ball with a ball ring.

what's on my mind?

i don't understand it.

okay. so what i want to know is. how does an emphasis. so. how does the individualized projects / team projects dichotomy reconcile itself with the work from home (WFH) / return to the office (RTO) dichotomy? and. i'm not trying to suggest.

anyway. i think that i've come with a solution to. like. how to respond. to any kind of. anyway. i'm not really going to worry about this for now because. i'm really not in that line of work anyway. and i have no intention of pursuing that line of work.

when i think about this. i just really don't want to suggest anything. i don't want to bring up anything that could. like. challenge the work from home (WFH) movement. i don't really want to say anything that would suggest that i'm anti-work-from-home, or anything. because.

and then, let's suppose hybrid-work environments. how do you hybridize individualized projects and team projects? what is the industry jargon for hybridized individualized collaboration work?

okay. i'll just take a position. if the team is the be all and end all of a project, then (RTO) would be optimal, wouldn't it? because you would have that additional layer of in-person collaboration that you just wouldn't get from tele-conferencing.

okay. so here. i have an idea for the. well. here's the thing. there are arguments for both sides of the return to the office (RTO) / work from home (WFH) argument.

one issue. one idea is that the (WFH) movement is a conspiracy on the part of the collaboration software industrial complex, how do we know this: cui bono! and, you could also say that, anyone who returns to the office (RTO) is, by definition, a team player, even if the person is a total introvert.

honestly, what side am i on? honestly: cui bono! i benefit most from (WFH) because i really don't like traffic. like really. why is there so much traffic. it's a car maker conspiracy! yeah. that's full disclosure.

and. yeah. that was really more thinking than i wanted to do after reading a short tweet and a few supporting tweets. 

i want to say that. i'm probably going to stay off of twitter for the time being.

i'm fucking tired.

alright. i'm feeling better. but. well. i wanted to say: who knows how long this will last. but. i don't want to think that way. i want to think. things are okay right now. and i'm sure they'll get better. i'm sure that things will continue to improve.

That was a nightmare. I went on this strange road-trip, crossing nearly a jillion states, I ended up in the psychiatric hospital on a court ordered mental health hold. Something similar to a 51-50 in California. and now I'm back home.

Notes from Arlington, Texas # 66

so first thing. sleep. second thing. file my disability claim.

i've gotten really fat. i've always been husky. but i feel like there was a time when i was getting lean. when i'm thin. it seems to worry people. i mean. i'm not thin.

good lord. nose hairs. i shaved all that fucking hair off, and my nose hairs were like a goatee practically. 

i was at the free play arcade here in arlington, and i think that i almost saw someone from vegas. but. i think it was actually vladamir putin. i mean. like vehicle wise.

...





Notes from Arlington, Texas # 71

I need to think for a minute. I was thinking: maybe everything since leaving Missouri has been a, kind of a two year manic episode, that's kind of still going on right now. I think it's kind of important to. maybe it's kind of important to take regular vacations or something. like small ones.

I finally sorted through all the stuff I had from the hospital, and all the weird shit I bought during the road trip. and I came across my discharge paperwork, and I have an appointment. a follow up appointment on the 15th.

* * *

This is a nightmare. and. well. I've been here before. so. I know what to expect. vaguely. 

...









Notes from Arlington, Texas #72 

I remember a time when I felt happy, and now, I'm not sure I feel any which way about anything.

The only thing I feel now is sadness. I'm heading back to Texas.

...







The rural carrier associate is a 
young woman with a lisp that lingers
long enough to wreck your week, and
fiery jade eyes that burn in your
mind every subsequent week.

I try to buy stamps, twenty is too much for
one stamp, and she can't break bills, and
I can't have them all, I ask to trade stamps,
one for one, she's not sure that's okay,
so she phones a friend. she asks
if I have exact change and I say:
yes! I do.

Notes from Arlington, Texas #73

These last few months have been extremely strange. I think I went on the exact same road trip twice. I think that I'm going to stay away from doing any kind of adventures or sill stuff for the time being. I have to catch up with whatever kind of garbage I sort of, got myself into over these last few months. I'm not sure why things have turned out this way, but it's not a huge deal, at least, I think that this is all fixable.

Notes, Thoughts, and Reflections While Using the Bloomberg Terminal









































something
happened
no one
knows what it was
but it was
something that
no one was
anticipating

...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

but the .prn file that i was trying to open earlier was probably from a spreadsheet that was exported from someone's pocket calculator, and then uploaded to where i can download it.


...







 
...

 





...










...

today is tuesday. what did i get done today?

so. i think i figured something out to the internship / work search issue.

i'm going to use the bloomberg terminal.

anyway.

that's exactly what i tried to do this morning. 

i figured that. since today is tuesday. i can work on something other than coursework.

so i worked on the work search.

i didn't know where to start,
but

only in the sense that i didn't know
where
i wanted to start.

so i just started exploring the tabs.

anyway. a lot of the companies that i'm interested in don't really have any openings. many don't even have a career page.

so.

i just mailed out a bunch of hand written letters.

the first company I called up. i mentioned that they were listed on the campus job board, but when i went to their website, they didn't even have a career page.

the person who answered the phone mentioned that they didn't have any openings, and they rarely have open positions.

so i figured i'd mail them a letter, saying that i'm interested in working for their company one day.

...

what's on my mind right now? Tuesday. tomorrow is tuesday.

...

it was kind of tedious, but I did it. i really have to figure out how to put this into words. but I went ticker by ticker. i mean. it didn't take a hell of a lot of time, but it really was tedious. really tedious.

...

There was one silly issue that I had because, I don't know what this would be refered to in the spreadsheet application that I typically use, but:

It's Called Freeze Panes / Freeze Rows.

Silly.

...

So here is one thing. I need to use two sources, I need to use Bloomberg for the Expected Returns, and I need to use State Street for the weights within the index.

see screenshot below.

I'm trying to highlight how I'm using the information from both sources, Bloomberg and State Street.

...





...

Below is a screenshot of the "custom" tab for the watchlist analytics function, and I'm wanting to put in a formula, but I don't know how to format formulas for the Bloomberg Terminal.

the issue is i want to be able to do Excel Stuff without opening Excel.

...











...

okay. so there are more screenshots here than i can really discuss.

i'm looking at the watchlist analytics for S5INDU and S5MATR in the Bloomberg terminal.

There is one thing that I'm interested in. and it's the tap at the far right that says "Custom"

I tried working with it, but, I haven't come up with anything.
...

 






...


i think that i figured something out.

...

















...


S5INDU is the ticker of the industrials index - XLI is the ETF that tracks the materials index
S5MATR is the ticker of the materials index - XLB is the ETF that tracks the materials index


...

so what was it?

it was odd. 

the sectors i intended on focusing on was materials.

how it works in this class is that industrials and materials are grouped together for the purposes of group assignments.

i remember when sectors were being assigned, the person who is my current group partner called out industrials, and i called out materials.

so i was under the impression that my group partner would want to work the industrials sector.

but when we spoke today, my group partner mentioned wanting to focus on materials.

but when we had minor group work together, my group partner went into the industrial set first, and then the materials set next.

this isn't a problem. really. but, i just don't know. if this is going to continue to oscillate back and forth or what.

what i'm thinking is. it really might not matter, the reason being that even though i might like materials, if.

well

it just shouldn't matter if i look at industrials or materials.

...

so what happened the other night? well, i was at the library later, I think about 45 minutes after midnight, I wanted to get a bunch of stuff done, but, I was tired, and there seem to be as many distractions during the night as there are during the day.

anyway. I want to continue working on my paper.

so in the example student paper, correlations are drawn between the index performance of the financials index, as well as the performance of the real estate index.

what what should I look at in my case?

what I'm thinking about is looking at the various correlations between the materials sector and various commodities.

so in the screenshot below i'm looking at the historical beta for the materials index and the

i think this is brent crude?

let me look.

okay, so it's WTI crude, but what does that mean?

...

















...

now what the hell was i thinking about? I think that i'm somewhat tired, and i'll come back to this later. it's just usually so crowded around here that I really can't get anything done, and I think that it's more or less the same issue.

...

well, i think that i've found something that I can amuse myself with whenever i think that i'm becoming distracted.

...

but it's basically this. I have an idea, and it is an amazing idea, and I think that most people will be impressed by it, if it can be executed in a way that people find interesting, and I think that most people will find it interesting because even when I just think about it, I'm intersted in it myself, and you think that most people will be interested in it, but, they probably won't be interested in it because it is such a trivial thing to pursue.

here is what I think about most things.

...

I can't figure out what the hell I was working on earlier, but I have found something that I'm interested in. I really have, and I think that I want to explore more of what I'm doing with this. and this should be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to the universe, and people all around the universe will be amazed with what I'm about to produce, and I will be quoted the universe over, by other sentient life forms, and even non-living forms of sentience, 

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

I'm going to look at the components in the materials sector of the  S&P 1500 index.

...

Well. truth is. I'm not sure where I was going to go with bond yields for the materials sector, I think what I wanted to do was to check into.

I guess somehow figure how sensitive the materials sector is to interest rates. I could probably use the other chart to figure out a correlation between the two.

like um. ten year treasuries and xlb.

but i'm sure that. um. 

i really want something more accurate.

I want to figure out what each company is actually paying in terms of interest coupon payments and how this interacts.

but i'm going to forget about this for now and look at something else. but what was it though? for whatever reason I can't recall what the hell I was thinking about.

...

I wanted to look at something, but I'm not sure where I'm going with this. What I think I was trying to look up, was.

I wanted to search. something like bonds. or. i wanted to see how the bond yields compare for companies listed in the materials sector, and compare these to dividend yields for the same companies, but here is the thing.

I'm not sure if this would really mean anything. I'm 

I guess. I'm currently under the assumption. that the bond yields should be comparable to the dividend yields, but I'm not sure why I'm assuming this. I guess, I'm not sure what makes me think that the bond yields should be comparable, so I'm not sure why I would want to figure out if the information in the Bloomberg terminal would either confirm my assumption or suspicion or hypothesis or what.

there are other things that I kind of want to look into here as well.

...

anyway. I think that this is as much note taking as I'm going to do for the day, and then I'm going to head home.

...

So I think this is the 5 year Volatility and Risk analysis, and the citation for this screenshot should be styled as:

S5MATR Index Historical Beta 5 YR, via Bloomberg LP, Accessed August 28, 2022

Notes:

Historical Beta

and 

Regression Analysis

are the same thing.

I think, unless I'm missing something.

What I mean is, it seems that when a person is trying to determine the historical beta of an index, or some other security against a benchmark

it's the same thing as performing a regression analysis of an index or some other security against a benchmark,

and it's possible that I already learned this at some point in the past

or maybe someone already told me this before, or maybe I came across this somewhere or another.

anyway.

the reason I'm fussing over this mentally is that the other day I said something like:



"So I would basically pay twice as much for the full set, right?"

and then the guy said

"No, you would just pay double for all four over the quoted price of just two."

and this is always annoying because, it's possible that two people are saying the same thing using different words, but there is always one person in any conversation who really doesn't understand that the same thing can be said in multiple ways. 


...

















...

I figured out how to put all four of the things I'm looking at into a single chart, the only thing is, is that it isn't very interesting to look at.

SPX Index Comparative Returns, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP Accessed August 28, 2022 

so the part of the assignment that I'm trying to work on has me look at: 

Price Performance, Total Return Analysis, Volatility and Risk Analysis, and Those are for YTD and 3YR Periods

and Positive Alpha over a 5 year period.
...

















...

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

XLB US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPY US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022



...



















...

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

the issue here is that I need to put the total return for both indices into a single graph, and not have 2 separate graphs, but I forgot how to do that.

anyway, as far as citation styling goes, I think that I would style the first as:

S5MATR Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...



















...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of: 

(Bloomberg, 2022)

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

one is that I want to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource, and if possible, the only resource,

and

I want to keep whatever graphics and images and charts that I use in the paper and class presentation to be screenshots and screen captures from the Bloomberg Terminal,

the other thing that I want to mention is that when i'm searching the materials sector, I'm alternating the columns between the GICS and BICS classification systems.


...





...

It really annoys me when the weather is hot and windy, because I want to keep the window open when it's hot, but the shades won't stop moving when it's windy and the window is open. I'm thinking about Sunday, and what to do on Sunday. I didn't apply for any internships or positions since I last wrote about wanting to find one. There's this endless competition between my desire to work on things of personal interest and things of professional interest, and educational pursuits are kind of a combination of both, or maybe educational pursuits are at the intersection of personal interests and professional interests. 

...

One thing about putting notes on my blog from sources around the internet is that I think it might make more sense to take screenshots of what I find, rather than copying and pasting the material because I file copyrights on the text from my blog, and I obviously can't file a copyright claim for text that I didn't write myself, so to prevent me from accidentally filing a copyright claim on someone else's content, I'll just make a reference to other people's content using screenshots, rather than copying and pasting the text.

There is also this other issue with inserting images into my blog. The issue involves where the lines break, and I guess I just figured out what happens. so I guess I answered the question to the issue that I was having. so there.

...





...
...

The sector analysis paper is due before the Bloomberg Certification is due, so, I guess I'll get started on that first.
...


...

 i went out to eat. i was on campus for
several hours doing course work. what else?
I think that I'm going to work on something.


when I got home after going out to eat. and
spending time on campus. and then going
out to eat again, i um. had trouble turning
on my laptop and i was really frustrated
about it. but i eventually got it turned out.




...


I'm tired. and hungry.
it's 330 am.
what could i eat?


...

I submitted a copyright claim for the previous post
and I'm thinking that for this post I'll just make it
one big
well
what i'm thinking is that i'll take a different
approach to how i format this post and
i think that i'm going to skip out on creating


lines between newer content and older content
and i'm not sure how this will look or how it will
appear. but i guess i'll see.


nah. you know what. now that i think about it. i do
have to create marks that separate one train of
thought from another train of thought and kind
of demarcate where one train of though begins
and where one ends. so


never mind.
well. i kind of want to head back to campus to
get some work done at the library. i think that today
i spent about 3 hours in the lab. i went to lunch at


11 AM, arrived at campus around 1 PM and left
at around 4 PM. or a little after.


there is an event at the stadium and it's packed and loud
and noisy and i think that i'll wait it out for now. i did
get an email from the student newspaper, and it had
an article or an advertisement of an information
section about student housing options that are on
campus, and i think that i'll explore those at some
point.

This was in January 2020, before the Pandemic, and my situation at the time was that I was working at the tractor warehouse and the hotel, I was saving and investing very aggressively and paying down my debts to improve my credit score. I had a few ideas for 2020 at the time, but, I really didn't have any definite plans. 

I was thinking that I could continue working two jobs, both of which were full time, and  80 + hours a week most of the time. I figured that I could continue saving and investing and improving my credit score until some kind of opportunity popped up, and I saw three possible opportunities. 

One possible opportunity was that I might somehow end up in a relationship with someone, I didn't have anyone definite in mind, but I thought that I might meet someone new and things would just happen right away, or maybe an existing friendship might become romantic, or an ongoing hook-up might become serious.

The second possible opportunity that I thought about was, was that I might pursue some kind of business opportunity if the right one popped up, either doing something that was interested in doing regardless of whether it was profitable or not, or pursuing a business opportunity that I was absolutely sure was profitable.

The third possible opportunity that I thought about pursuing was going back to college at UMKC, I had already been accepted for the fall semester of 2019 but I withdrew before the semester started, and I figured that I might come back around to this idea if the circumstances seemed right.










































...


In my mind, capitalizing on any one of these three possible opportunities would have been easiest if I had money, and the ability to borrow money, and that's why I wanted to continue focusing on saving, investing, and working on my credit score.

Taking a new job, even if it was one that I was interested in, would have taking me in a different direction. In retrospect, I ended up in a totally different direction anyway. I ended up in Texas, but in January of 2020 I was thinking that if I continued to work at the tractor factory and the hotel, at some point during 2020 I would be able to pursue one of the three opportunities that I thought about pursuing, it was just a matter of one of the three possible opportunities presenting itself, and then, I'd pounce.

Anyway. I was at the Library in Lewisville. I went to Lewisville for lunch, and it was a really long drive getting there, not in milage, but time, so I figured that I would go to the nearest library, which was in Lewisville, rather than heading all the way back to Arlington to get some work done at home, or at the campus library, or the city library. I didn't get anything done. Well, I didn't get anything concrete done. I did manage to reflect about the last time I applied for a similar position, and why I thought that taking the position wasn't right at the time, but I still have to think about if pursuing such a position is right at this point in time, and I think that it is. The reason is that I'm looking for an internship, and if I can find a Spring 2023 internship, that would be really great, however, pursuing an Summer 2023 internship, and landing a position in the meantime is preferable.

I did miss two career related opportunities at school, there was a work-study workshop a few days ago, and a career fair that happened today. I tried to find the campus career center the other day, but I ran into an issue: sometimes maps and directory of the campus list either the names, or the purpose of the building, there might be Preston Hall or Ransom Hall, and there might be the Science Building, or the Engineering Building, and so on. Well, I remember walking across campus and I came across a building, once, that just said Career Center or UTA Career Center, or something, but on the map, and on the directory, there is no such building, the directory listed a career center, but when I went to the location listed on the directory, it took me to the Student Administration Building, which I'm guessing had a career center or something, or maybe they administered the work-study program. One possibility is that, and this is probably the situation, I think that the Financial Aid Office is in the Student Administration Building, and I think that work-study is related to Financial Aid, and I remember that the FAFSA application asks if applicants to specify if they are interested in work-study grants, and that work-study grants are limited, and needs-based, or allocated on the basis or need or something.

Well, anyway. If there is such a thing as an academic year, then today is the start of the academic weekend. I feel guilty for not doing anything objectively productive today, but, it's important that I reflect on things that have happened in the past in order to formulate an approach to things that are happening in the present. I'm going to make a firm commitment to apply for an open position at the company, and mention that my intention is to participate in an internship with the company later on in the future, and also work on some of my course work.

...

I have to keep looking for some kind of work-study program, an internship, or a co-op program. The internship that I was for fall, but, since it was a 6 month program stretching from July to December, I'm guessing that candidates have already been selected, so I'm not going to complete the application there. Then, after my first class today I came across another internship that I would be interested in for the Summer of 2023, however, that's ten months to a year out into the future, and I think that I might change my mind at that point.

I dropped one class to bring me back down to six units per semester, the only reason I was trying to take nine units was to apply for the transportation fellowship, but, that prospect is kind of moot right now.

...

I was thinking about buying a new outfit or something, but I have a million outfits. I really don't need to buy any more outfits. In fact I really think that I shouldn't be buying much of anything until I find work. I'm still somewhat conflicted about the work search.

Well, I just came to a conclusion. I shouldn't be looking for specific positions. I mean. I didn't have a specific position in mind anyway. What I mean is. I shouldn't be browsing open positions. I should be looking for, and looking at internships and co-op positions. I'm applying for one right now.

This looks like it's going to be a long process. Applying for the internship / co-op, and doing it in a way that makes me an appealing candidate. 

...

So what happened today? well. there was a kind of monsoon kind of rain storm in the Dallas - Fort Worth area, and my area was kind of hard hit. In fact. There is another section of the apartment complex that was ordered to evacuate after having flooded.

The weather kind of effected me in a way that I wasn't really expecting. I wasn't going to buy a parking permit because I consider the distance from my residence to the campus to be perfectly walkable. but. it's really not walkable in the rain. I wore this wool jacket that I bought at an army surplus store and it started to smell like a goat once it got wet.

I need to apply for 1 position before the day, well, night ends, but I'll come around to that.

anyway. i bought a parking permit and looked for a place to park, the parking lot I thought would have space, did not have space, so I parked in this other parking lot, and walked around campus and stuff. got a student ID and checked out the campus library. the campus library is open 24 hours a day, and I really want to see how that works. I was exploring and stuff, and, then I checked the time, and it turned out to be about 30 minutes before class started. The business building is close to the street, so even though it's a smoke-free campus, it's not a far walk to get off-campus. more or less.

anyway. I think i finished all the stuff. all the major challenges of fixing stuff around my apartment. and. I'm excited because one section of the wall in my closet looks almost like it could be a painting in its own right. like it could be a painting of it's own. almost. i really like it. but here is the thing.

I want to take a picture of it, but. I almost feel like people might get the wrong idea of it. like. as though i'm clueless about craftsmanship or something. and what i mean is.

i think that the work that i've performed on my wall should be judged according to the standards of artistry, rather than the standards of craftsmanship.

anyway. i think i'll apply for a position. and then take a look at the stuff for school. 

I don't know if any more storms are expected for the coming days.

oh and about the job search. i remember. for a while i was getting flooded with emails and text messages for positions with this or that company, this was back before the june road trip. and. for some reason i really didn't respond to anything. but there was a position that i accepted, but didn't complete the on-boarding process with. i thought the position was. well. i don't know what i thought but i didn't take the position, because i was skeptical about the whole thing. but when i took the first road trip and passed through Nashville, it occurred to me that i shouldn't have been as skeptical as i was.

anyway.

...

Notes from Arlington, Texas # 69

* * *

I'm going to take a nap, and see where that goes. There was an email from college that was dated 06/20, and it's fucking 07/12. I responded to the email and took care of the things they told me to, but, I don't think that I have to worry too much since the fall semester doesn't start for another 5 weeks I think.

one thing that I didn't know, until going on this road trip, was that chip cards can actually be held by the card chip reader.

* * *

"The Young Woman who is the Post Office"

The rural carrier associate is a 
young woman with a lisp that lingers
long enough to wreck your week, and
fiery jade eyes that burn in your
mind every subsequent week.

I try to buy stamps, twenty is too much for
one stamp, and she can't break bills, and
I can't have them all, I ask to trade stamps,
one for one, she's not sure that's okay,
so she phones a friend. she asks
if I have exact change and I say:
yes! I do.

...

i think that the above post was from after my first roadtrip. it had to have been. the post is dated for early july, and the road trip was during june, and then i was in the hospital for about half of july. and that's one thing i have to look into. the hospital bills. shit.

...

first day of class. it was kind of an ordeal because it was raining.

...

I'm hungry. i had catfish. for lunch. and flounder.

...

I put my class schedule on my calendar. I updated my LinkedIn.

I did some organizing.

I did some additional work on my closet. paint and glue take longer to dry than i originally imagined.

um. i didn't mention this here, but i painted my patio after having painted a painting on my patio. i made a painting out of my patio, and then followed it up with painting the patio in a kind of concrete colored gray. and now it more or less looks like a patio that never had anything special done to it. there is one issue: even though I used interior / exterior paint. it seems to bubble up from time to time. so i usually just pop the paint bubbles like concrete, and then leave it at that. i'm sure that at some point i'll paint over them, and if they bubble up again, then i'll just pop them again.

i have to apply for a position before i head to sleep.

it's hot, but it's also windy. so leaving the window open has it's limitations.

well. now it's raining. i applied for a position, and this position has nothing to do with finance, or even with business.

...

I want to rethink this:

School Starts tomorrow.

I have to look for work.

I have to repair a few things with my apartment.

and I have to organize my personal things.

school starting. and looking for work play into each other in the sense that i need to look for work that is relevant to my studies, that works from a scheduling and commute standpoint.

but there is also the competing issue of just needing to find something that pays the bills.

and it's possible that there might be something that isn't relevant to my studies. but is something that i'm interested in. and it pays the bills. something like this would be working at art & crafts supplies store. another thing would be. there was this furniture store that I came across when I was in Illinois that I found interesting. I don't know how to describe it because it wasn't exactly a furniture store, and it wasn't exactly a home improvement store. it did sell furniture, and it did have displays of different types of engineered hardwoods, tiles, and synthetic woods, and carpets.

and then. as far as looking for work goes. there is this landscaping thing that i think is interesting. when I was in the looney bin there was a guy there who said he has a landscaping business. and. the only reason i'm thinking about this is because there was a person on twitter who posted photographs of her front yard, and how she transformed it from a front yard lawn, into a front yard forest. in fact i'm still looking for that photograph.

i got sidetracked goofing off on twitter. and all i was really doing was looking for that photograph of that one lady two transformed her front yard from a front yard lawn. into a front yard forest preserve.

...

i have to get my thoughts together. but i have to take a nap first.

school starts tomorrow.

i have to look for work.

i have work on things around my apartment.

i have to get organized.

the school issue bleeds into the work issue. in the sense that i have to find work with a work schedule that works with my school schedule, and maybe even works commute wise. or i guess i mean. something close to home and school.

...

alright. well i applied for 1 position. and i did work on something around my apartment. i worked on the wall in my closet. i'm dealing with one issue. that. is kind of a silly issue. but kind of a serious issue. but not a totally serious issue. it's the issue of having too much fucking paint. i bought one gallon of  gray paint, that i really didn't need, and one gallon of black paint, an amount that i definitely didn't need. anyway. i'm kind of using the black paint as kind of. well. i don't know. i mean. i don't know how to explain how i'm using it. my intention isn't to paint the wall black.

...

i found a position that i want to apply for.

so I applied. now the other thing.

what can i do around my apartment?

I had a flower pot, and i tried to plant a bouquet of flowers that i bought a few days ago, but it didn't work. um. the other day i also saw a plant that i wanted to buy, but i didn't buy it. so. that was that.

i have to make a point of submitting one application a day,

...

i went out to buy a pipe tobacco, and, for some reason, I selected a tobacco shop in Hurst as the place that I would take directions to. I ended up buying a pipe, some cigarettes, and a brass ring featuring a kind of figurine of Ganesha. and then. while driving back. i stopped at a kind of tex-mex style restaurant and ate there, i felt like i didn't eat as much as i would normally eat, given how much i enjoy eating, but i ate enough to be full.

okay. today. i want to get a few things done: (1) submit at least 1 application or resume (2) do some kind of work on my apartment after submitting an application.

one of my neighbors gave me a few packets of ramen that she said she didn't want to eat because she didn't like the flavor, but i think that i threw away my cooking pot a while back.

...

Notes from Arlington, Texas # 70

the first thing i need to do is get some sleep. the second thing i need to do is find work. one of the things that hangs me up when it comes to filing a disability claim is that. i feel. at least in my mind. that i'm capable of working without accommodations.

i think what i'll do is file the disability claim with the answer that i am capable of working.

so first thing. sleep. second thing. file my disability claim.

i've gotten really fat. i've always been husky. but i feel like there was a time when i was getting lean. when i'm thin. it seems to worry people. i mean. i'm not thin.

good lord. nose hairs. i shaved all that fucking hair off, and my nose hairs were like a goatee practically. 

i was at the free play arcade here in arlington, and i think that i almost saw someone from vegas. but. i think it was actually vladamir putin. i mean. like vehicle wise.

...

i found one solution to the nose hairs issue, cutting them back can be a headache, and i think, at one point in the past, i used to pluck them out using a tweezer, but there is this small set of scissors that i have with rounded tips that comes with most sewing set, so i'm guessing that it's a sewing scissors, well, i use that thing to cut my nose hairs.

the thing about nose hairs, and the particular challenge that i face regarding nose hairs, is that my nose is short. and i think that most hairs, including nose hairs, have a maximum growth length beyond which they no longer grow. and i think that the maximum growth length of nose hairs exceeds the length of my nose. my really short nose.

what else? who is the someone from vegas? the girl from rainbow boulevard. for some reason, that post seems like it was such a long time ago. and i think i wrote it shortly after the end of my road trip, and subsequent stay in the hospital. so maybe just 1 + 2/3 of a month ago.

...

there are two competing issues when it comes to looking for work. on the one hand. i should be looking for something relevant to my degree. or at least. something that i'm interested in. and could potentially get given that i'm a student. and. that being a student should stand in for a lack of relevant experience.

on the other hand. i might be just fine looking for something that just sort of. you know. covers my expenses with. you know. something left over.

...

I applied for 1 position. I don't think that I included a cover letter. I was thinking about including a cover letter. in fact. including a cover letter was something that i really wanted to do, but for some reason. it slipped my mind.

...

I threw away this shirt that I've had for a while. It was just a regular blue shirt, there was nothing special about it, and I remember buying like, two fucking years ago, and I finally threw it away. I remember buying it, and, shortly afterward a thread came loose, so I tried to fix it using super glue, but it left this kind of glue crust that constantly scratched my skin, and I just sort of lived with it. I have a bunch of other fucking shirts so I don't know why I held on to it for so long, and, just didn't throw it away.

Sometimes I try to donate old clothes that I don't use anymore, but I can never find donation bins, and some donation stations aren't open in the middle of the night. so, i end up just throwing old clothes out, or leaving them near the garbage can for anyone who might want them. I don't know where those ultimately end up, and they might just end up in the trash can anyway.

I need to get a few things from the store. mainly just sodas. i can probably run to the gas station later, in the middle of the night since the gas station is always open, but i'm not doing anything right now and i really don't know what else to do.

i few days ago i thought about going on another. a fucking third. cross-country road trip. but i only made it as far as. somewhere in Dallas. I guess. i was taking the side streets in as much of a north-east direction as the signs could direct me, but it was rush hour, and i hardly got anywhere before i got really frustrated with the traffic and just headed home. i stopped at a convenience store, but, they didn't have any cigarettes, so, i was in a bad mood. i bought a jug of mango juice, and drank it.

I also thought about. i don't know. changing the appearance of my blog.

I changed it.

What other crap? am I thinking about?  

...

I change my clothes several times a day, but no matter what I change into, I always feel sticky.

...

I had to make a payment to UTA for the additional class that I enrolled in. I made a partial payment. I'll pay the rest tomorrow.

...

i ordered a three topping pizza the other day, even though this particular pizza place didn't really have a "make your own pizza" option. i think i had spinach, onions, and artichokes, but these were actually pasta options. i tried adding shrimp, but the lady at the counter said that they didn't offer shrimp on their pizzas, so i didn't have shrimp pizza.

...

for food. i went to the grocery store, and bought a half-gallon of ice-cream. and i ate it all.

so this fellowship opportunity is something of a no-go for right now. maybe next semester. even though there would have been aspects of my application that would have been lacking, like my academic record, i don't really have one, considering that i'm going into my first semester, there is another issue. i really don't have anyone who can provide me with a letter of recommendation on short notice.

Obtaining letters of recommendation can be kind of an issue for me. i don't really know anyone. i don't really make very many friends. i don't really network.

...

i really don't know if i'm hungry or not. i mean i am hungry, but i don't know if i'm hungry enough to go out and get food right now. and if i do go out to get something to eat, what would i go out and eat? i just don't know. there are so many unanswered questions. hehe.

...

i think that my patio and balcony, the railing or whatever, are in nice enough condition that i can stop working on it. there is other stuff that i could work on around my apartment. but i have a hell of a lot of left over paint.

and i have all these fucking tools. i have a hell of a lot of hammers that i really don't anticipate ever. using.

...

I have too much fucking. stuff. clutter. i started throwing away some stuff. but. nothing that i really planned on keeping anyway. i didn't throw away anything that i thought was potentially useful. in fact. i threw away a neck tie that i've had for a long time. and i haven't had a reason to wear a tie in a long fucking time.

...

I'm going to make a change to this post. I was originally putting the newest additions to this post at the bottom of the post, but, just to make it easier to anyone who reads these posts, I'm going to put the newest additions to the post at the top of the post.

...

I have this idea. and. it's more or less similar to every other idea i've ever had. so. I guess this isn't really a new idea or anything. it's just a variation on an existing idea. i'm just going to write one long ass poem. called. painting the patio. and that's it. i'm going to work some of my other writings into this poem. somehow.

...

what are some things that i'm dealing with right now? school starts. classes start on the 22nd of august. i haven't worked in about 2 months. i've been obliterating my investment and retirement accounts. i have stuff i have to catch up on. i have to clear out my car. i have to get my car fixed. routine maintenance and stuff. i can't believe how many miles i've driven these last few months. i have traffic tickets and highway tolls that i need to pay. i have social security stuff and this other stuff i have to deal with. i have to. well. i should be looking for work.

...

I never received payment for the unpaid wages claim that i filed with the Texas Workforce Commission. I'm really glad I stopped working for that janitorial company after 2 days. it would have been just a larger amount of unpaid wages.

one of the issues with the unpaid wages claim that I submitted to the Texas Workforce Commission is that the investigator assigned to my claim kept calling me and asking for information that i already listed in the initial claim that i filed.

my guess is that he was hoping that i wouldn't come around to responding, and then would disposition the claim as: claimant unresponsive, or something. and then end the issue that way.

anyway. i think that i filed a claim for around 110 dollars or something. so it's not a big deal.

...

"Painting the Patio"

...

there was an issue with one of the copyright claims that i filed a while back. the claim was kicked back as filed incorrectly, or, that the claim couldn't be processed as submitted, and would have to be resubmitted. and that's just another thing that i'm not totally going to deal with right now.

i think that this particular copyright claim. and the unpaid wages claim. are both things that i could pursue until i receive a satisfactory resolution. right now. i'm just not going to deal with these things.

Notes from Arlington, Texas #73

These last few months have been extremely strange. I think I went on the exact same road trip twice. I think that I'm going to stay away from doing any kind of adventures or sill stuff for the time being. I have to catch up with whatever kind of garbage I sort of, got myself into over these last few months. I'm not sure why things have turned out this way, but it's not a huge deal, at least, I think that this is all fixable.

...

what were the things that i need to fix? well. these adventures that i've gone on left my credit cards maxed out, my checking accounts drained, my investment accounts empty, and. well. everything is kind of a catastrophe.

...

i think that i sold most of my bullion coins at pawn shops and coin dealers in other states. i took quite a bit of losses on those fucking things. those were pointless places to put my money.

...

Notes from Arlington, Texas #72

I remember a time when I felt happy, and now, I'm not sure I feel any which way about anything.

The only thing I feel now is sadness. I'm heading back to Texas.

...

I don't know where I was when I wrote that post. I was probably in a different state, as in, a state other than Texas, but probably in a different mental state as well. right now I'm clearing out my list of things to do. there are a lot of things that I need to take care of. I kind of need to look for work again. and I kind of want to work nights, but this might not work with my class schedule, since most class times assume that people work during the day, and, well, most people do work during the day.

...

I'm cleaning up old posts, and I'm going to turn them all into one gigantic post. that's the idea here.

...

I still kind of want to drive to Alaska. I think it would be the coolest thing ever. I mean, other people have done it before, but. I haven't done it before. and I think it would be the most amazing thing that I could do. i have to take care of a number of things before i do something like this. i have to take care of any traffic tickets and tolls that i've racked up over these past few months while taking road trips. and then i have to have work done on my car. i have to look for work too. i am nearly cleared out financially. i'm lucky that nothing major happened to my car during this road trip, like during my road trip through Louisiana.

117 Sanford Street

What is on my List of Things to do?

I won't worry about that right now.
What i was thinking was that. well.
sometimes i think funny things, and
sometimes i remember funny things,
and there are times when i wish that
i had written those funny thoughts
and things down somewhere. i don't
always get a chance to do that.

* * *

it hasn't really mattered to me in the
longest time.

...

Ken Yamat, is the one who did this and Kenneth L. Yamat, is also the
one who also did this they did it, but is it Kenneth or Ken?
well It all depends on who you ask and when you ask.

* * *

I have work tomorrow early in the
afternoon. the stock market ran up,
and then abruptly dipped the other
day. Still, my limit order wasn't filled.
not that I exactly want to to be filled.
i mean. i do want to to be filled but
i don't know if i want a drop that big.

* * *

there was this thing that happened the other day. I got an email regarding chocolates, and, i was thinking about sending the blue box recipient a box of chocolates. but. i don't even know. there is no telling what that could lead to. and i mean that in the sense that there are negative consequences of sending a box of chocolates that I'm worried about.

* * *

but here is another thing, maybe chocolates could be a hint for something else. i have no idea. well. i don't know really. like maybe, maybe the second job stuff and sending a gift with my resume. it's an idea, but i'm not sure how well it would work.

* * *

working on cleaning out my email box. also working on cleaning up my calendar of stuff that i can do whenever.

* * *

benefits elections. i can do that later.

* * *

i may need to check my mailbox at the UPS Store. i have to actually go out there, but i think that i actually went there not too long ago. i really don't want to check it more than i need to because checking it requires a special journey.

* * *

this is where Sanford street 117 and the Painting the Patio post switch from one to the other.

...

it's been a while since I had a mailbox at the UPS store. a long time. I thought that simply having a mailbox would be enough for most of the things that I need an address for, but, for some reason, i need to have a legitimate residential address for a lot of things that require an address, and a mailbox, a private mailbox or even a post office box isn't enough to satisfy those address requirements.

after the 1-year lease of the mailbox at the UPS store, I didn't bother to renew. there seems to be an issue with my residential mailbox, however. the city postal carrier doesn't seem to make much of an effort picking up the outgoing mail. it might be that he doesn't bother picking it up daily, or, maybe he just never picks it up.

...

I'm really tired. I've been staying up late. I haven't been doing anything interesting. Other than painting my patio. I kind of like the way it looks.

The two main things that I need to focus on right now are my social security disability application, stuff for college, and cleaning and repairing things around my apartment.

the disability application is due in a few fucking days, the college stuff is due a few fucking days after that, and the apartment stuff really doesn't have a due date or deadline.

...

I'm really thinking about forgetting about the social security disability application for now. the reason being that. even if i finish the application by the deadline, which is in a few days. it takes months for a decision to be made, and then several more months to receive a first payment. i'm better off just forgetting about if for now, having my claim denied, and then maybe reapplying later on down the line, and anyway. i might be able to find work before then.

...

i bought a new computer, but it is way slower than my previous computer. way slower.

...

Letters from Sanford Street # 44

Oh my god. Jesus. My lord.

I'm uploading all of these Submittable poems to my Blog. Many of them haven't been here before. Many of them I haven't already scraped and posted to my blog. The reason why is that. While a submission is under consideration by the magazine or journal, it's important that the work in the submission doesn't appear any where else, either online or in print, so I may have just left them in Submittable without posting them here, and later forgot to collect them when they were rejected.

I'm at the Copyright website, and checking it out.

* * *

I want to try getting a copyright on something, just to fill out the form, and pay the fee, and see how the whole process works. I don't think that I'll eventually make any money out of this. I don't think that I'm going to make any money from anything that I copyright. This is just an experiment.

...

The previous section was from my Letters from Sanford Street series. I think that it was posted some time in September of 2020. and I think, it had to have been before I filed my first copyright. and I think. my first piece of writing that I submitted to the copyright office was "The Senior Director."

...

I deleted my Plenty of Fish account. I think that I had about 8 months left on my subscription, but, it was more or less useless anyway. I'm not sure that I really want to pursue a relationship, or, anything like that, even in my profile I think that I noted that I'm not really looking for a relationship or any kind of commitment. There wasn't an option to describe exactly why I don't want to use the dating app any more, so I just selected the option "I give up" as the reason for deleting my account.

...

Notes from Arlington, Texas # 71

I need to think for a minute. I was thinking: maybe everything since leaving Missouri has been a, kind of a two year manic episode, that's kind of still going on right now. I think it's kind of important to. maybe it's kind of important to take regular vacations or something. like small ones.


I finally sorted through all the stuff I had from the hospital, and all the weird shit I bought during the road trip. and I came across my discharge paperwork, and I have an appointment. a follow up appointment on the 15th.

* * *

This is a nightmare. and. well. I've been here before. so. I know what to expect. vaguely.

...

So, after the road trip that landed me in the hospital, I went on a similar road trip the following month. I'm back home. I'm not working.

There are a few things related to school that I'm working on. One is getting into a 3rd class. Part of the reason I'm trying to get into this third class is because I'm applying for this fellowship, it's kind of a research grant, and it comes with a monthly stipend. Anyway, the fellowship requires that I'm enrolled full-time, which is 9 units for a graduate student.

So I'm trying to get into this third class, and there is this kind of application process involved.

...

I have to try not to feel overwhelmed by the things that I have to deal with. None of this is too serious. None of this is too challenging.

...

I completed my application for the third class that I'm trying to get into, but I also managed to complete my Social Security Disability application as well. What happened with the disability application is that, I really didn't want to go through all the paperwork involved, much of the information required would have been kind of a headache to go through and track down. I was lucky because someone from the social security administration reached out to me over the phone, and submitted a revised application based on my responses to his questions.

I was somewhat amused by some of my own responses to his questions.

So now I just have to work on my fellowship application.

and then look for work.

today was a kind of a normal day i guess. i'm tired. sometimes i need to smoke, and i go outside, and someone is always there. or arrives shortly after i arrive. what is the hiatus? i think that a hiatus is when something is delayed.

whatever i'm waiting for. i still seem to be waiting for it. 

i also have to remember to buy sneakers. i already have shoes and boots, but i think that i have boots that would actually meet the specifications listed in the job description, so i may be able to wear those if my boots don't arrive. i might need to start shopping now actually.

or, to put it another way, i may need to actually start shopping now. 

* * *

i'm super tired. what i think is. it's getting hot again. i think i need to just stay inside. i think it's the actual sun that is actually burning me right now. so tired.

I don't know if I would call this hate-mail or what. I have no idea, the person doesn't seem to like me, although. I think I may know the person, but I don't think that I really know who this is from. I don't know. I'm irritated. I was discouraged.

this is an email i received through the blogger contact form.

Yo, quit being a simp. She isn't going to give you a reply just for
mailing her a 900 dollar ring. You're wasting your time and money over
love that does not exist. She already moved on and is already focusing on
her career and social life. Women themselves are flawed and are not that
perfect themselves just like us. I'm concerned for your mental health
because it seems that you're OBSESSED with her and its not a good thing.
You think I don't understand anything about love but I have tried it and it
didn't work out. That girl tries to get my hopes high but it ultimately
fails when she doesnt give me attention during our causal date while at the
same time working (yes, it was badly planned out). I had to move on
because it was a waste of time for me. I hope you learn to move on and do
good for yourself. Otherwise, you're gonna learn the hard way. I wish you
the best in life. If not, then you're gonna go down the rabbit hole.

i am really tired. i don't know what is coming next. i'm so tired. the climate here is so different from the way the climate was in either missouri or nevada or california. i realize now how different things can be between different places. it was so hot in nevada that it had to have been hotter than here. i usually stayed indoors in nevada because it was so hot. interviewees. when i came across that word, i was surprised that it was actually spelled that way.

there are times when i think that i should have stayed in missouri, but whatever. really. whatever. i miss <Text Removed>.

i took a hiatus from work for a while. i just can't make it there. it's too far. it's too hot. i'm sure that i will survive this. but i don't always know how to do things in a way that makes very much sense to me. i'm tired. what else do i have to sell.

i realized something. in life. it's kind of important to conform. it's just the way it is i guess. 

i'm at the point in my life where i'm struggling just to put food on the table. for one. i don't have a microwave, and i'm afraid of the stove.

i don't know. my thoughts are all over the place.

i bought a paper newspaper.

i was at a coffee shop and i spoke with one of the cashier's and a kind of awakening. i think the reason i didn't really fit in when i was in missouri was that. i wasn't super political. i dislike spending all day arguing about this or that stuff.

let's see. what happened. it's never clear to me which political movement i should side with. we all just want to rip each other apart and give each other shit i think.

what do i do for money? what do i do for money?

i think that we are in that universe where everyone has to take sides and duke it out to the death. or maybe this is all bullshit. i don't really know.

Hi Ken, I hope all is well. I have been a reader of your blog for some time, I truly hope you pick things back up again. I just want to say that there are people out there that truly cares for your well being, never think that you are alone.

You may think that the choices you made are poor or whatever it is, but things happen for a reason right? You made a choice to come to Texas and whether or not it is on a whim, you are there and experiencing life. Who do you know right now, that can pack everything up and just move to a random location? It takes a lot of guts to do that.

Your posts takes people on a roller coaster, it goes up and down. You know what I feel honestly about your feelings about Kristin? You need to let that go, it looks like she has moved on with her relationship and career. You want to spend your time and energy on what is in front of you NOW, not what has happened in the past. Sure, things that you have previously experienced in the past may sculpt how you are as a person now but don't linger in the past. It is time to move on, it will hurt for me to say this but I don't think Kristen ever cared. If she did, you two would be together now. So move on from this part of your life. There are plenty of fishes in the water, there are plenty of wonderful women out there waiting for their future partner. I wished that I had taken this same advice that I am giving you now, had I wasted 10 years of my life with someone who never gave a damn. I finally moved on and found my life partner. I hope you are able to find this person sometime in the future, because you WILL know when this special person steps in your life. Trust me, you will know it. It is not Kristen and unfortunately, it has never been Kristen.

As for your career, I feel as though you are very good with literature and very poetic. Have you considered writing your own book? Just a thought.

All in all, I wish you the best of luck. I hope things start looking more positive. You are a great person, continue to be you. Live the life that you dream. Don't sleep in a sleeping bag, spend money on yourself. Take care of yourself because no one else will. Love yourself and BE WHO YOU ARE.

Your avid reader,
Jamie

i'm really thinking about going on a road trip. just for the weekend. i'm not thinking about relocating. realistically, i can't relocate.

there are a few problems with the job i currently have. i never seem to be able to get to work. i really can't. i think the company is fine, but i just can't seem to get to work. i have to resign at some point and then find something closer to where i live.

i can't relocate again, not for a while, i've hemorrhaged too much cash in just this one move. 

this move was a huge disaster. i don't have any other options really at this point.

I'm actually stuck here.

i'm still thinking. i'm going to go on this little road trip of whatever.

i need to look for a job closer to home, but, i'm not sure how much i can really get done during the weekend.

i keep reading articles about career this, and career that, and shit like that.

and

when i was in cameron missouri, i was on track to make 70 thousand that year, just in wages.

i didn't have anything that would traditionally be defined as a career, but i enjoyed it.

i didn't have shit else to worry about, other than going to work, and going to sleep.

i didn't have some girlfriend constantly making me feel insecure about myself.

or nagging kids unhappy with whatever life i could afford to give them.

or some wife telling me we need a bigger house with a bigger mortgage.

i didn't have any friends i had to compete with in the social pecking order.

i didn't have to worry about who had the biggest dick, or the hottest girlfriend, or the fastest car or the biggest house.

i was actually happy. i was actually just in my own universe, and i was the master of that fucking universe, i did what i fucking wanted to do, and i fucking enjoyed it.

and i was actually really happy with that set up.

i have to think. what the hell do i do now.

i have to look for a new job, and i'll do that when i get back.

yeah. i came back from this little road trip of mine. i can't exactly sleep right now. for one thing. it is kind of hot. for some reason this room always makes me light headed.

it was a long road trip. and honestly. i felt like i can get better sleep on the road as opposed to in this apartment.

i don't know what to say. 

i can't sleep. so i figured that i might as well work on something.

i was thinking about organizing my stuff.

i figure that i might as well jot down some notes, and maybe work on my calendar.

i'm not sure how many times i've already said this, but i went to the public safety office to try to get a driver's licence, and i won't be able to get one until next year, when there is availability for an appointment.

whatever.

it may make sense to go back to my job at the airport.

it's temporary, and seasonal, so maybe i don't have to worry too much about anything.

but maybe they hired someone else for that position.

so maybe i'll just figure that whole thing out later.



june 15th is when i left cameron missouri

maybe sooner. i have no idea.

so it's been two months in texas.

these are strange times for me.

* * *

thinking back to when this all started. i'm doing things that i've been wanting to do, but i think that i'm doing them sooner than i wanted to.

i've been wanting to move out of my dad's house for a while. i guess i finally did, but i really think this was earlier than i wanted.

i think that if i took my time with things, i would have relocated to the kansas city area instead, went to UMKC, and then looked for a job, or career or whatever after graduation, in the Kansas City area.

i had the fucking money to do it.

* * * 

I think that i probably would have continued working two jobs for another year or two if i had my way with things. if i stayed in cameron, missouri. saved up more money and really did something cool.

* * *

let's think things through again. my first choice would have been that nothing changed for another two years. i would have kept working at the warehouse and at the hotel, living with my dad, and saving and investing my money. maybe i would have looked for another morning job that payed more than the hotel, and was more clerical or more of in an office setting, a desk job, or paperwork job or whatever.

my second choice would have been to go to graduate school at UMKC, get the MS in Finance, take a few classes in real estate finance, and project finance or something, a few classes in engineering, accounting, some other stuff, maybe math. a few art classes.

* * *

my neighbor tried to start a conversation with me right now. i shut the door. i'm not trying to be rude with the guy but i'm working on something, i'm kind of trying to get my shit together, my thoughts together or whatever, and his ass is distracting me.

it would make sense to see if i can get my job back at the airport.

really. i'm still not sure why i'm in texas.

i wanted to see <Text Removed>, but if that's not going to happen, then that just one less reason to stick around.

i would like to go to college here, but if i don't get it, then it would probably make more sense to 

head back to missouri and see if i can renew my application or whatever.



if i can't get into college in texas, that's really also one less reason to stick around.



in terms of work. i just need to be able to tread water for the next 12 months.

at a minimum i just need to be able to tread water for 12 months.

obviously i'd like to do more than that, but in life, i'm not sure that i always get what i want.

they don't seem to pay very well. but i think i mentioned before that for the time being, that i only really need to tread water at the moment.

I'm applying for jobs closer to home. i would like to look more into this laboratory stuff. i applied for a few.

i have never used linkedin for finding a job. or at least not much.

there was this sales position with a company here in the dallas fort worth area where i connected with hiring manager via linkedin. it didn't exactly go anywhere.

I'm applying for one of these positions directly on the company website.

Whenever I'm applying for a job. I typically hammer and barrage the posts. I don't know what else to do really.

Supposing that application submissions are more tailored and targeted, what would that result in?

i'm trying to think of a series of events, or a sequence of events that happened recently.

so.

a while ago i started sending my receipts to myself, rather than to <Text Removed>. i'm not sure why i was sending her my receipts.

i guess the main reason was to show that i was actually in texas and not bullshitting about it.

then i get the reader comment saying, like saying something, like forget <Text Removed> or whatever, it irritated me somewhat because i was already kind of heading in that direction.

i ended up going on a weekend road trip around texas. i bought a few <Text Removed> name tags, and another braclet.

i thought about sending them to her, and then i thought about keeping them for myself. 

but i think that i might just mail them off to her.

but i kind of want to keep them.

i don't know what to do about that situation.

some of this stuff is actually kind of cool.

i actually do. have to kind of focus on getting my shit here together in texas.

so what in shits name should i do right now? looking for a job. i think. there are a few paths that i can take, and i really have to think through what is the optimal path.

if i just need to tread water for the time being. if i just need to stay afloat or whatever, and i just need to make enough money to pay my bills for the time being.

then maybe i should look for a job that has some kind of career path or whatever.

i should have tried to do the program or whatever at UMKC. Instead I went on this bizarre adventure.

i did have to get away from my dad, and my family and all that.

about a certain devil-voodoo-chick
who rules my mind and is always on it,
in my cranium i hear her tongue flick

sensibilities in my ear like: "move 
on idiot, i hardly remember
who the fuck you are, other than the smooth,
greasy, bald head of yours, and the embers

on the tips of those cigarettes you smoked
constantly like you were some kind of clit-
sucker." A few days ago I had stroked
my last paper letter, tossed in the slit

of a mailbox at a post office in
some small town: i hope it's not if, but when.

so what are some of the things that i'm thinking about right now?
the first thing is getting set up with a second job. the main issue with this idea is that i'm already extremely tired and fatigued after my work at the cargo docks of the airport. however, i noticed that i'm very energized after taking a nap of 3 - 4 hours. so work not be as exhausting as i think it is. 

it might be the heat, more than anything that makes me tired and fatigued. i don't operate equipment at the airport docks, so most of my times is spent actually lifting and moving things.

the second thing that's on my mind is getting set up with some kind of side-hustle. i don't really have anything specific in mind, but one is the courier / food delivery stuff. i had this idea of getting set up on viator and doing a kind of slice of life postmates experience. i thought that it might be fun.

but i really dislike driving. when i get off work at the airport, there is so much traffic on monday, and tuesday that i'm in a real state of annoyance as i drive home.

the other side-hustle idea is selling stuff online. i have to watch some videos on how to do this. the only time i ever did anything like this was in cameron, missouri, and i sold 2 pairs of shoes that i never wore on craigslist.

i did buy some silver coins online. one of them is from 1987, but i realized that i bought one that isn't certified and graded. it's obviously not a counterfeit coin, but being certified and graded gives collectors some kind of erection, and makes the coin more collectible. I think that i bought 4 coins total.

...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

but the .prn file that i was trying to open earlier was probably from a spreadsheet that was exported from someone's pocket calculator, and then uploaded to where i can download it.

...

today is tuesday. what did i get done today?

so. i think i figured something out to the internship / work search issue.

i'm going to use the bloomberg terminal.

anyway.

that's exactly what i tried to do this morning. 

i figured that. since today is tuesday. i can work on something other than coursework.

so i worked on the work search.

i didn't know where to start,
but

only in the sense that i didn't know
where
i wanted to start.

so i just started exploring the tabs.

anyway. a lot of the companies that i'm interested in don't really have any openings. many don't even have a career page.

so.

i just mailed out a bunch of hand written letters.

the first company I called up. i mentioned that they were listed on the campus job board, but when i went to their website, they didn't even have a career page.

the person who answered the phone mentioned that they didn't have any openings, and they rarely have open positions.

so i figured i'd mail them a letter, saying that i'm interested in working for their company one day.

...

what's on my mind right now? Tuesday. tomorrow is tuesday.

...

it was kind of tedious, but I did it. i really have to figure out how to put this into words. but I went ticker by ticker. i mean. it didn't take a hell of a lot of time, but it really was tedious. really tedious.

...

There was one silly issue that I had because, I don't know what this would be refered to in the spreadsheet application that I typically use, but:

It's Called Freeze Panes / Freeze Rows.

Silly.

...

So here is one thing. I need to use two sources, I need to use Bloomberg for the Expected Returns, and I need to use State Street for the weights within the index.

see screenshot below.

I'm trying to highlight how I'm using the information from both sources, Bloomberg and State Street.

...





...

Below is a screenshot of the "custom" tab for the watchlist analytics function, and I'm wanting to put in a formula, but I don't know how to format formulas for the Bloomberg Terminal.

the issue is i want to be able to do Excel Stuff without opening Excel.

...











...

okay. so there are more screenshots here than i can really discuss.

i'm looking at the watchlist analytics for S5INDU and S5MATR in the Bloomberg terminal.

There is one thing that I'm interested in. and it's the tap at the far right that says "Custom"

I tried working with it, but, I haven't come up with anything.
...

 






...


i think that i figured something out.

...

















...


S5INDU is the ticker of the industrials index - XLI is the ETF that tracks the materials index
S5MATR is the ticker of the materials index - XLB is the ETF that tracks the materials index


...

so what was it?

it was odd. 

the sectors i intended on focusing on was materials.

how it works in this class is that industrials and materials are grouped together for the purposes of group assignments.

i remember when sectors were being assigned, the person who is my current group partner called out industrials, and i called out materials.

so i was under the impression that my group partner would want to work the industrials sector.

but when we spoke today, my group partner mentioned wanting to focus on materials.

but when we had minor group work together, my group partner went into the industrial set first, and then the materials set next.

this isn't a problem. really. but, i just don't know. if this is going to continue to oscillate back and forth or what.

what i'm thinking is. it really might not matter, the reason being that even though i might like materials, if.

well

it just shouldn't matter if i look at industrials or materials.

...

so what happened the other night? well, i was at the library later, I think about 45 minutes after midnight, I wanted to get a bunch of stuff done, but, I was tired, and there seem to be as many distractions during the night as there are during the day.

anyway. I want to continue working on my paper.

so in the example student paper, correlations are drawn between the index performance of the financials index, as well as the performance of the real estate index.

what what should I look at in my case?

what I'm thinking about is looking at the various correlations between the materials sector and various commodities.

so in the screenshot below i'm looking at the historical beta for the materials index and the

i think this is brent crude?

let me look.

okay, so it's WTI crude, but what does that mean?

...

















...

now what the hell was i thinking about? I think that i'm somewhat tired, and i'll come back to this later. it's just usually so crowded around here that I really can't get anything done, and I think that it's more or less the same issue.

...

well, i think that i've found something that I can amuse myself with whenever i think that i'm becoming distracted.

...

but it's basically this. I have an idea, and it is an amazing idea, and I think that most people will be impressed by it, if it can be executed in a way that people find interesting, and I think that most people will find it interesting because even when I just think about it, I'm intersted in it myself, and you think that most people will be interested in it, but, they probably won't be interested in it because it is such a trivial thing to pursue.

here is what I think about most things.

...

I can't figure out what the hell I was working on earlier, but I have found something that I'm interested in. I really have, and I think that I want to explore more of what I'm doing with this. and this should be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to the universe, and people all around the universe will be amazed with what I'm about to produce, and I will be quoted the universe over, by other sentient life forms, and even non-living forms of sentience, 

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

I'm going to look at the components in the materials sector of the  S&P 1500 index.

...

Well. truth is. I'm not sure where I was going to go with bond yields for the materials sector, I think what I wanted to do was to check into.

I guess somehow figure how sensitive the materials sector is to interest rates. I could probably use the other chart to figure out a correlation between the two.

like um. ten year treasuries and xlb.

but i'm sure that. um. 

i really want something more accurate.

I want to figure out what each company is actually paying in terms of interest coupon payments and how this interacts.

but i'm going to forget about this for now and look at something else. but what was it though? for whatever reason I can't recall what the hell I was thinking about.

...

I wanted to look at something, but I'm not sure where I'm going with this. What I think I was trying to look up, was.

I wanted to search. something like bonds. or. i wanted to see how the bond yields compare for companies listed in the materials sector, and compare these to dividend yields for the same companies, but here is the thing.

I'm not sure if this would really mean anything. I'm 

I guess. I'm currently under the assumption. that the bond yields should be comparable to the dividend yields, but I'm not sure why I'm assuming this. I guess, I'm not sure what makes me think that the bond yields should be comparable, so I'm not sure why I would want to figure out if the information in the Bloomberg terminal would either confirm my assumption or suspicion or hypothesis or what.

there are other things that I kind of want to look into here as well.

...

anyway. I think that this is as much note taking as I'm going to do for the day, and then I'm going to head home.

...

So I think this is the 5 year Volatility and Risk analysis, and the citation for this screenshot should be styled as:

S5MATR Index Historical Beta 5 YR, via Bloomberg LP, Accessed August 28, 2022

Notes:

Historical Beta

and 

Regression Analysis

are the same thing.

I think, unless I'm missing something.

What I mean is, it seems that when a person is trying to determine the historical beta of an index, or some other security against a benchmark

it's the same thing as performing a regression analysis of an index or some other security against a benchmark,

and it's possible that I already learned this at some point in the past

or maybe someone already told me this before, or maybe I came across this somewhere or another.

anyway.

the reason I'm fussing over this mentally is that the other day I said something like:



"So I would basically pay twice as much for the full set, right?"

and then the guy said

"No, you would just pay double for all four over the quoted price of just two."

and this is always annoying because, it's possible that two people are saying the same thing using different words, but there is always one person in any conversation who really doesn't understand that the same thing can be said in multiple ways. 


...

















...

I figured out how to put all four of the things I'm looking at into a single chart, the only thing is, is that it isn't very interesting to look at.

SPX Index Comparative Returns, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP Accessed August 28, 2022 

so the part of the assignment that I'm trying to work on has me look at: 

Price Performance, Total Return Analysis, Volatility and Risk Analysis, and Those are for YTD and 3YR Periods

and Positive Alpha over a 5 year period.
...

















...

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

XLB US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPY US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022



...



















...

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

the issue here is that I need to put the total return for both indices into a single graph, and not have 2 separate graphs, but I forgot how to do that.

anyway, as far as citation styling goes, I think that I would style the first as:

S5MATR Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...



















...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of: 

(Bloomberg, 2022)

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

one is that I want to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource, and if possible, the only resource,

and

I want to keep whatever graphics and images and charts that I use in the paper and class presentation to be screenshots and screen captures from the Bloomberg Terminal,

the other thing that I want to mention is that when i'm searching the materials sector, I'm alternating the columns between the GICS and BICS classification systems.


...





...

It really annoys me when the weather is hot and windy, because I want to keep the window open when it's hot, but the shades won't stop moving when it's windy and the window is open. I'm thinking about Sunday, and what to do on Sunday. I didn't apply for any internships or positions since I last wrote about wanting to find one. There's this endless competition between my desire to work on things of personal interest and things of professional interest, and educational pursuits are kind of a combination of both, or maybe educational pursuits are at the intersection of personal interests and professional interests. 

...

One thing about putting notes on my blog from sources around the internet is that I think it might make more sense to take screenshots of what I find, rather than copying and pasting the material because I file copyrights on the text from my blog, and I obviously can't file a copyright claim for text that I didn't write myself, so to prevent me from accidentally filing a copyright claim on someone else's content, I'll just make a reference to other people's content using screenshots, rather than copying and pasting the text.

There is also this other issue with inserting images into my blog. The issue involves where the lines break, and I guess I just figured out what happens. so I guess I answered the question to the issue that I was having. so there.

...





...
...

The sector analysis paper is due before the Bloomberg Certification is due, so, I guess I'll get started on that first.
...


...

 i went out to eat. i was on campus for
several hours doing course work. what else?
I think that I'm going to work on something.


when I got home after going out to eat. and
spending time on campus. and then going
out to eat again, i um. had trouble turning
on my laptop and i was really frustrated
about it. but i eventually got it turned out.




...


I'm tired. and hungry.
it's 330 am.
what could i eat?


...

I submitted a copyright claim for the previous post
and I'm thinking that for this post I'll just make it
one big
well
what i'm thinking is that i'll take a different
approach to how i format this post and
i think that i'm going to skip out on creating


lines between newer content and older content
and i'm not sure how this will look or how it will
appear. but i guess i'll see.


nah. you know what. now that i think about it. i do
have to create marks that separate one train of
thought from another train of thought and kind
of demarcate where one train of though begins
and where one ends. so


never mind.
well. i kind of want to head back to campus to
get some work done at the library. i think that today
i spent about 3 hours in the lab. i went to lunch at


11 AM, arrived at campus around 1 PM and left
at around 4 PM. or a little after.


there is an event at the stadium and it's packed and loud
and noisy and i think that i'll wait it out for now. i did
get an email from the student newspaper, and it had
an article or an advertisement of an information
section about student housing options that are on
campus, and i think that i'll explore those at some
point.

you're wondering what
that feeling is. it's sweat!
you've been working out
and now you are greasy.
or you've been humping
your lover like the two of
you haven't humped each
other in years. you asked
yourself what that greasy
feeling might be. and
the answer to that question.
is not butter. butter was not.
and is not the answer to your
question. and maybe you
remember that time you
covered your hair in melted
butter to alleviate the dryness
of your hair. remember. it
was not the answer to that
problem. it did not fix
anything you tried to fix.

This is the Third Time, September 3rd, 2022

im not an indolent moron, nor am i an insolent ingrate. im tired. thats it. i guess it's a smoking room.

i ended up smoking in the room anyway. dont worry. i didnt have any fucking food. so i ate the nearest thing available. 

anyway. i know it took me a while to return to dallas, but, i figured that time was not of the essence, since compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe.

however. i have to figure something out. i cant find my fucking calculator. i havent upgraded since 1989. i dont even know if i still have that thing. shit.

...

always. if i visit Kentucky. i invariably manage to take the route back to dallas that passes through nashville. or vice versa, like last month.

...

anyway.

now what the hell was i thinking about? I think that i'm somewhat tired, and i'll come back to this later. it's just usually so crowded around here that I really can't get anything done, and I think that it's more or less the same issue.

...

well, i think that i've found something that I can amuse myself with whenever i think that i'm becoming distracted.

...

but it's basically this. I have an idea, and it is an amazing idea, and I think that most people will be impressed by it, if it can be executed in a way that people find interesting, and I think that most people will find it interesting because even when I just think about it, I'm intersted in it myself, and you think that most people will be interested in it, but, they probably won't be interested in it because it is such a trivial thing to pursue.

here is what I think about most things.

...

I can't figure out what the hell I was working on earlier, but I have found something that I'm interested in. I really have, and I think that I want to explore more of what I'm doing with this. and this should be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to the universe, and people all around the universe will be amazed with what I'm about to produce, and I will be quoted the universe over, by other sentient life forms, and even non-living forms of sentience, 

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

I'm going to look at the components in the materials sector of the  S&P 1500 index.

...

Well. truth is. I'm not sure where I was going to go with bond yields for the materials sector, I think what I wanted to do was to check into.

I guess somehow figure how sensitive the materials sector is to interest rates. I could probably use the other chart to figure out a correlation between the two.

like um. ten year treasuries and xlb.

but i'm sure that. um. 

i really want something more accurate.

I want to figure out what each company is actually paying in terms of interest coupon payments and how this interacts.

but i'm going to forget about this for now and look at something else. but what was it though? for whatever reason I can't recall what the hell I was thinking about.

...

I wanted to look at something, but I'm not sure where I'm going with this. What I think I was trying to look up, was.

I wanted to search. something like bonds. or. i wanted to see how the bond yields compare for companies listed in the materials sector, and compare these to dividend yields for the same companies, but here is the thing.

I'm not sure if this would really mean anything. I'm 

I guess. I'm currently under the assumption. that the bond yields should be comparable to the dividend yields, but I'm not sure why I'm assuming this. I guess, I'm not sure what makes me think that the bond yields should be comparable, so I'm not sure why I would want to figure out if the information in the Bloomberg terminal would either confirm my assumption or suspicion or hypothesis or what.

there are other things that I kind of want to look into here as well.

...

anyway. I think that this is as much note taking as I'm going to do for the day, and then I'm going to head home.

...

So I think this is the 5 year Volatility and Risk analysis, and the citation for this screenshot should be styled as:

S5MATR Index Historical Beta 5 YR, via Bloomberg LP, Accessed August 28, 2022

Notes:

Historical Beta

and 

Regression Analysis

are the same thing.

I think, unless I'm missing something.

What I mean is, it seems that when a person is trying to determine the historical beta of an index, or some other security against a benchmark

it's the same thing as performing a regression analysis of an index or some other security against a benchmark,

and it's possible that I already learned this at some point in the past

or maybe someone already told me this before, or maybe I came across this somewhere or another.

anyway.

the reason I'm fussing over this mentally is that the other day I said something like:



"So I would basically pay twice as much for the full set, right?"

and then the guy said

"No, you would just pay double for all four over the quoted price of just two."

and this is always annoying because, it's possible that two people are saying the same thing using different words, but there is always one person in any conversation who really doesn't understand that the same thing can be said in multiple ways. 


...

















...

I figured out how to put all four of the things I'm looking at into a single chart, the only thing is, is that it isn't very interesting to look at.

SPX Index Comparative Returns, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP Accessed August 28, 2022 

so the part of the assignment that I'm trying to work on has me look at: 

Price Performance, Total Return Analysis, Volatility and Risk Analysis, and Those are for YTD and 3YR Periods

and Positive Alpha over a 5 year period.
...

















...

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

XLB US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPY US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022



...



















...

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

the issue here is that I need to put the total return for both indices into a single graph, and not have 2 separate graphs, but I forgot how to do that.

anyway, as far as citation styling goes, I think that I would style the first as:

S5MATR Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...



















...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of: 

(Bloomberg, 2022)

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

one is that I want to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource, and if possible, the only resource,

and

I want to keep whatever graphics and images and charts that I use in the paper and class presentation to be screenshots and screen captures from the Bloomberg Terminal,

the other thing that I want to mention is that when i'm searching the materials sector, I'm alternating the columns between the GICS and BICS classification systems.


...





...

It really annoys me when the weather is hot and windy, because I want to keep the window open when it's hot, but the shades won't stop moving when it's windy and the window is open. I'm thinking about Sunday, and what to do on Sunday. I didn't apply for any internships or positions since I last wrote about wanting to find one. There's this endless competition between my desire to work on things of personal interest and things of professional interest, and educational pursuits are kind of a combination of both, or maybe educational pursuits are at the intersection of personal interests and professional interests. 

...

One thing about putting notes on my blog from sources around the internet is that I think it might make more sense to take screenshots of what I find, rather than copying and pasting the material because I file copyrights on the text from my blog, and I obviously can't file a copyright claim for text that I didn't write myself, so to prevent me from accidentally filing a copyright claim on someone else's content, I'll just make a reference to other people's content using screenshots, rather than copying and pasting the text.

There is also this other issue with inserting images into my blog. The issue involves where the lines break, and I guess I just figured out what happens. so I guess I answered the question to the issue that I was having. so there.

...





...
...

The sector analysis paper is due before the Bloomberg Certification is due, so, I guess I'll get started on that first.
...


...

 i went out to eat. i was on campus for
several hours doing course work. what else?
I think that I'm going to work on something.


when I got home after going out to eat. and
spending time on campus. and then going
out to eat again, i um. had trouble turning
on my laptop and i was really frustrated
about it. but i eventually got it turned out.




...


I'm tired. and hungry.
it's 330 am.
what could i eat?


...

I submitted a copyright claim for the previous post
and I'm thinking that for this post I'll just make it
one big
well
what i'm thinking is that i'll take a different
approach to how i format this post and
i think that i'm going to skip out on creating


lines between newer content and older content
and i'm not sure how this will look or how it will
appear. but i guess i'll see.


nah. you know what. now that i think about it. i do
have to create marks that separate one train of
thought from another train of thought and kind
of demarcate where one train of though begins
and where one ends. so


never mind.
well. i kind of want to head back to campus to
get some work done at the library. i think that today
i spent about 3 hours in the lab. i went to lunch at


11 AM, arrived at campus around 1 PM and left
at around 4 PM. or a little after.


there is an event at the stadium and it's packed and loud
and noisy and i think that i'll wait it out for now. i did
get an email from the student newspaper, and it had
an article or an advertisement of an information
section about student housing options that are on
campus, and i think that i'll explore those at some
point.

Back Home, September 9th, 2022

Back Home, September 9th, 2022

i dont know what happened the other day. but i seemed to have irritated the bartender at this pizza place i went to. i really didn't understand what happened.

she seemed upset about something. she said that she wanted me to leave. so i paid and left.

a guy chased after me, and said: "No one here thinks that's funny."

and i still have no idea what i did, or what offense i committed.

i remember, i asked where the basil was, and a woman behind me said:

"the toppings are placed underneath the cheese here."

and i responded: "you're right about that, i've eaten here before."

and then i just sort of went at it with my pizza,

and then the bartender became upset.

my nails were dirty, really dirty, and i was eating two slices of pizza at a time. like a pig.

and maybe that was the thing, she was irritated that i was eating like a pig.

but.

i think that i was eating with a fork and knife first, and then
i started eating with my hands.

maybe i should just change my major or something.

i really fucking wanted to go to school, but, i don't really know what the hell to do.

...




...



...







...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

but the .prn file that i was trying to open earlier was probably from a spreadsheet that was exported from someone's pocket calculator, and then uploaded to where i can download it.


...







 
...

 





...










...

today is tuesday. what did i get done today?

so. i think i figured something out to the internship / work search issue.

i'm going to use the bloomberg terminal.

anyway.

that's exactly what i tried to do this morning. 

i figured that. since today is tuesday. i can work on something other than coursework.

so i worked on the work search.

i didn't know where to start,
but

only in the sense that i didn't know
where
i wanted to start.

so i just started exploring the tabs.

anyway. a lot of the companies that i'm interested in don't really have any openings. many don't even have a career page.

so.

i just mailed out a bunch of hand written letters.

the first company I called up. i mentioned that they were listed on the campus job board, but when i went to their website, they didn't even have a career page.

the person who answered the phone mentioned that they didn't have any openings, and they rarely have open positions.

so i figured i'd mail them a letter, saying that i'm interested in working for their company one day.

...

what's on my mind right now? Tuesday. tomorrow is tuesday.

...

it was kind of tedious, but I did it. i really have to figure out how to put this into words. but I went ticker by ticker. i mean. it didn't take a hell of a lot of time, but it really was tedious. really tedious.

...

There was one silly issue that I had because, I don't know what this would be refered to in the spreadsheet application that I typically use, but:

It's Called Freeze Panes / Freeze Rows.

Silly.

...

So here is one thing. I need to use two sources, I need to use Bloomberg for the Expected Returns, and I need to use State Street for the weights within the index.

see screenshot below.

I'm trying to highlight how I'm using the information from both sources, Bloomberg and State Street.

...





...

Below is a screenshot of the "custom" tab for the watchlist analytics function, and I'm wanting to put in a formula, but I don't know how to format formulas for the Bloomberg Terminal.

the issue is i want to be able to do Excel Stuff without opening Excel.

...











...

okay. so there are more screenshots here than i can really discuss.

i'm looking at the watchlist analytics for S5INDU and S5MATR in the Bloomberg terminal.

There is one thing that I'm interested in. and it's the tap at the far right that says "Custom"

I tried working with it, but, I haven't come up with anything.
...

 






...


i think that i figured something out.

...

















...


S5INDU is the ticker of the industrials index - XLI is the ETF that tracks the materials index
S5MATR is the ticker of the materials index - XLB is the ETF that tracks the materials index


...

so what was it?

it was odd. 

the sectors i intended on focusing on was materials.

how it works in this class is that industrials and materials are grouped together for the purposes of group assignments.

i remember when sectors were being assigned, the person who is my current group partner called out industrials, and i called out materials.

so i was under the impression that my group partner would want to work the industrials sector.

but when we spoke today, my group partner mentioned wanting to focus on materials.

but when we had minor group work together, my group partner went into the industrial set first, and then the materials set next.

this isn't a problem. really. but, i just don't know. if this is going to continue to oscillate back and forth or what.

what i'm thinking is. it really might not matter, the reason being that even though i might like materials, if.

well

it just shouldn't matter if i look at industrials or materials.

...

so what happened the other night? well, i was at the library later, I think about 45 minutes after midnight, I wanted to get a bunch of stuff done, but, I was tired, and there seem to be as many distractions during the night as there are during the day.

anyway. I want to continue working on my paper.

so in the example student paper, correlations are drawn between the index performance of the financials index, as well as the performance of the real estate index.

what what should I look at in my case?

what I'm thinking about is looking at the various correlations between the materials sector and various commodities.

so in the screenshot below i'm looking at the historical beta for the materials index and the

i think this is brent crude?

let me look.

okay, so it's WTI crude, but what does that mean?

...

















...

now what the hell was i thinking about? I think that i'm somewhat tired, and i'll come back to this later. it's just usually so crowded around here that I really can't get anything done, and I think that it's more or less the same issue.

...

well, i think that i've found something that I can amuse myself with whenever i think that i'm becoming distracted.

I have an idea, and it is an amazing idea, and I think that most people will be impressed by it, if it can be executed in a way that people find interesting, and I think that most people will find it interesting because even when I just think about it, I'm intersted in it myself, and you think that most people will be interested in it, but, they probably won't be interested in it because it is such a trivial thing to pursue.

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

so the part of the assignment that I'm trying to work on has me look at: 

Price Performance, Total Return Analysis, Volatility and Risk Analysis, and Those are for YTD and 3YR Periods

and Positive Alpha over a 5 year period.

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

i dont feel like drowning to death. right now. i asked the sheriff for directions, he said theres a hotel in the big city. i got there. and there was no hotel. i guess i should have asked the deputy, but either he didnt have a deputy, or the deputy was in invisible mode. so.

...

When I think about. I don't know what to say.

this is the third road trip in 3 months. i'm tired. and. im just so irritable.

i want to be nice, but, sometimes i end up in places i dont really want to be.

i really don't want to withdraw from school. i think that the discipline i'm pursuing is an important one.

i just don't know why i face the challenges that i face.

but this third road trip. really. even though it has been a nightmare, i don't think that the outcome will be as terrible as.

i just don't know what to say.

i really want to finish the program. im heading all the way back to texas. again.







...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

but the .prn file that i was trying to open earlier was probably from a spreadsheet that was exported from someone's pocket calculator, and then uploaded to where i can download it.

...

today is tuesday. what did i get done today?

so. i think i figured something out to the internship / work search issue.

i'm going to use the bloomberg terminal.

anyway.

that's exactly what i tried to do this morning. 

i figured that. since today is tuesday. i can work on something other than coursework.

so i worked on the work search.

i didn't know where to start,
but

only in the sense that i didn't know
where
i wanted to start.

so i just started exploring the tabs.

anyway. a lot of the companies that i'm interested in don't really have any openings. many don't even have a career page.

so.

i just mailed out a bunch of hand written letters.

the first company I called up. i mentioned that they were listed on the campus job board, but when i went to their website, they didn't even have a career page.

the person who answered the phone mentioned that they didn't have any openings, and they rarely have open positions.

so i figured i'd mail them a letter, saying that i'm interested in working for their company one day.

...

what's on my mind right now? Tuesday. tomorrow is tuesday.

...

it was kind of tedious, but I did it. i really have to figure out how to put this into words. but I went ticker by ticker. i mean. it didn't take a hell of a lot of time, but it really was tedious. really tedious.

...

There was one silly issue that I had because, I don't know what this would be refered to in the spreadsheet application that I typically use, but:

It's Called Freeze Panes / Freeze Rows.

Silly.

...

So here is one thing. I need to use two sources, I need to use Bloomberg for the Expected Returns, and I need to use State Street for the weights within the index.

see screenshot below.

I'm trying to highlight how I'm using the information from both sources, Bloomberg and State Street.

...





...

Below is a screenshot of the "custom" tab for the watchlist analytics function, and I'm wanting to put in a formula, but I don't know how to format formulas for the Bloomberg Terminal.

the issue is i want to be able to do Excel Stuff without opening Excel.

...











...

okay. so there are more screenshots here than i can really discuss.

i'm looking at the watchlist analytics for S5INDU and S5MATR in the Bloomberg terminal.

There is one thing that I'm interested in. and it's the tap at the far right that says "Custom"

I tried working with it, but, I haven't come up with anything.
...

 






...


i think that i figured something out.

...

















...


S5INDU is the ticker of the industrials index - XLI is the ETF that tracks the materials index
S5MATR is the ticker of the materials index - XLB is the ETF that tracks the materials index


...

so what was it?

it was odd. 

the sectors i intended on focusing on was materials.

how it works in this class is that industrials and materials are grouped together for the purposes of group assignments.

i remember when sectors were being assigned, the person who is my current group partner called out industrials, and i called out materials.

so i was under the impression that my group partner would want to work the industrials sector.

but when we spoke today, my group partner mentioned wanting to focus on materials.

but when we had minor group work together, my group partner went into the industrial set first, and then the materials set next.

this isn't a problem. really. but, i just don't know. if this is going to continue to oscillate back and forth or what.

what i'm thinking is. it really might not matter, the reason being that even though i might like materials, if.

well

it just shouldn't matter if i look at industrials or materials.

...

so what happened the other night? well, i was at the library later, I think about 45 minutes after midnight, I wanted to get a bunch of stuff done, but, I was tired, and there seem to be as many distractions during the night as there are during the day.

anyway. I want to continue working on my paper.

so in the example student paper, correlations are drawn between the index performance of the financials index, as well as the performance of the real estate index.

what what should I look at in my case?

what I'm thinking about is looking at the various correlations between the materials sector and various commodities.

so in the screenshot below i'm looking at the historical beta for the materials index and the

i think this is brent crude?

let me look.

okay, so it's WTI crude, but what does that mean?

...

















...

now what the hell was i thinking about? I think that i'm somewhat tired, and i'll come back to this later. it's just usually so crowded around here that I really can't get anything done, and I think that it's more or less the same issue.

...

well, i think that i've found something that I can amuse myself with whenever i think that i'm becoming distracted.

...

but it's basically this. I have an idea, and it is an amazing idea, and I think that most people will be impressed by it, if it can be executed in a way that people find interesting, and I think that most people will find it interesting because even when I just think about it, I'm intersted in it myself, and you think that most people will be interested in it, but, they probably won't be interested in it because it is such a trivial thing to pursue.

here is what I think about most things.

...

I can't figure out what the hell I was working on earlier, but I have found something that I'm interested in. I really have, and I think that I want to explore more of what I'm doing with this. and this should be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to the universe, and people all around the universe will be amazed with what I'm about to produce, and I will be quoted the universe over, by other sentient life forms, and even non-living forms of sentience, 

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

I'm going to look at the components in the materials sector of the  S&P 1500 index.

...

Well. truth is. I'm not sure where I was going to go with bond yields for the materials sector, I think what I wanted to do was to check into.

I guess somehow figure how sensitive the materials sector is to interest rates. I could probably use the other chart to figure out a correlation between the two.

like um. ten year treasuries and xlb.

but i'm sure that. um. 

i really want something more accurate.

I want to figure out what each company is actually paying in terms of interest coupon payments and how this interacts.

but i'm going to forget about this for now and look at something else. but what was it though? for whatever reason I can't recall what the hell I was thinking about.

...

I wanted to look at something, but I'm not sure where I'm going with this. What I think I was trying to look up, was.

I wanted to search. something like bonds. or. i wanted to see how the bond yields compare for companies listed in the materials sector, and compare these to dividend yields for the same companies, but here is the thing.

I'm not sure if this would really mean anything. I'm 

I guess. I'm currently under the assumption. that the bond yields should be comparable to the dividend yields, but I'm not sure why I'm assuming this. I guess, I'm not sure what makes me think that the bond yields should be comparable, so I'm not sure why I would want to figure out if the information in the Bloomberg terminal would either confirm my assumption or suspicion or hypothesis or what.

there are other things that I kind of want to look into here as well.

...

anyway. I think that this is as much note taking as I'm going to do for the day, and then I'm going to head home.

...

So I think this is the 5 year Volatility and Risk analysis, and the citation for this screenshot should be styled as:

S5MATR Index Historical Beta 5 YR, via Bloomberg LP, Accessed August 28, 2022

Notes:

Historical Beta

and 

Regression Analysis

are the same thing.

I think, unless I'm missing something.

What I mean is, it seems that when a person is trying to determine the historical beta of an index, or some other security against a benchmark

it's the same thing as performing a regression analysis of an index or some other security against a benchmark,

and it's possible that I already learned this at some point in the past

or maybe someone already told me this before, or maybe I came across this somewhere or another.

anyway.

the reason I'm fussing over this mentally is that the other day I said something like:



"So I would basically pay twice as much for the full set, right?"

and then the guy said

"No, you would just pay double for all four over the quoted price of just two."

and this is always annoying because, it's possible that two people are saying the same thing using different words, but there is always one person in any conversation who really doesn't understand that the same thing can be said in multiple ways. 


...

















...

I figured out how to put all four of the things I'm looking at into a single chart, the only thing is, is that it isn't very interesting to look at.

SPX Index Comparative Returns, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP Accessed August 28, 2022 

so the part of the assignment that I'm trying to work on has me look at: 

Price Performance, Total Return Analysis, Volatility and Risk Analysis, and Those are for YTD and 3YR Periods

and Positive Alpha over a 5 year period.
...

















...

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

XLB US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPY US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022



...



















...

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

the issue here is that I need to put the total return for both indices into a single graph, and not have 2 separate graphs, but I forgot how to do that.

anyway, as far as citation styling goes, I think that I would style the first as:

S5MATR Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...



















...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of: 

(Bloomberg, 2022)

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

one is that I want to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource, and if possible, the only resource,

and

I want to keep whatever graphics and images and charts that I use in the paper and class presentation to be screenshots and screen captures from the Bloomberg Terminal,

the other thing that I want to mention is that when i'm searching the materials sector, I'm alternating the columns between the GICS and BICS classification systems.


...





...

It really annoys me when the weather is hot and windy, because I want to keep the window open when it's hot, but the shades won't stop moving when it's windy and the window is open. I'm thinking about Sunday, and what to do on Sunday. I didn't apply for any internships or positions since I last wrote about wanting to find one. There's this endless competition between my desire to work on things of personal interest and things of professional interest, and educational pursuits are kind of a combination of both, or maybe educational pursuits are at the intersection of personal interests and professional interests. 

...

One thing about putting notes on my blog from sources around the internet is that I think it might make more sense to take screenshots of what I find, rather than copying and pasting the material because I file copyrights on the text from my blog, and I obviously can't file a copyright claim for text that I didn't write myself, so to prevent me from accidentally filing a copyright claim on someone else's content, I'll just make a reference to other people's content using screenshots, rather than copying and pasting the text.

There is also this other issue with inserting images into my blog. The issue involves where the lines break, and I guess I just figured out what happens. so I guess I answered the question to the issue that I was having. so there.

...





...
...

The sector analysis paper is due before the Bloomberg Certification is due, so, I guess I'll get started on that first.
...


...

 i went out to eat. i was on campus for
several hours doing course work. what else?
I think that I'm going to work on something.


when I got home after going out to eat. and
spending time on campus. and then going
out to eat again, i um. had trouble turning
on my laptop and i was really frustrated
about it. but i eventually got it turned out.




...


I'm tired. and hungry.
it's 330 am.
what could i eat?


...

I submitted a copyright claim for the previous post
and I'm thinking that for this post I'll just make it
one big
well
what i'm thinking is that i'll take a different
approach to how i format this post and
i think that i'm going to skip out on creating


lines between newer content and older content
and i'm not sure how this will look or how it will
appear. but i guess i'll see.


nah. you know what. now that i think about it. i do
have to create marks that separate one train of
thought from another train of thought and kind
of demarcate where one train of though begins
and where one ends. so


never mind.
well. i kind of want to head back to campus to
get some work done at the library. i think that today
i spent about 3 hours in the lab. i went to lunch at


11 AM, arrived at campus around 1 PM and left
at around 4 PM. or a little after.


there is an event at the stadium and it's packed and loud
and noisy and i think that i'll wait it out for now. i did
get an email from the student newspaper, and it had
an article or an advertisement of an information
section about student housing options that are on
campus, and i think that i'll explore those at some
point.

Back Home, September 9th, 2022

Back Home, September 9th, 2022

i dont know what happened the other day. but i seemed to have irritated the bartender at this pizza place i went to. i really didn't understand what happened.

she seemed upset about something. she said that she wanted me to leave. so i paid and left.

a guy chased after me, and said: "No one here thinks that's funny."

and i still have no idea what i did, or what offense i committed.

i remember, i asked where the basil was, and a woman behind me said:

"the toppings are placed underneath the cheese here."

and i responded: "you're right about that, i've eaten here before."

and then i just sort of went at it with my pizza,

and then the bartender became upset.

my nails were dirty, really dirty, and i was eating two slices of pizza at a time. like a pig.

and maybe that was the thing, she was irritated that i was eating like a pig.

but.

i think that i was eating with a fork and knife first, and then
i started eating with my hands.

maybe i should just change my major or something.

i really fucking wanted to go to school, but, i don't really know what the hell to do.

...




...



...







...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...



















...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of: 

(Bloomberg, 2022)

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

one is that I want to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource, and if possible, the only resource,

and

I want to keep whatever graphics and images and charts that I use in the paper and class presentation to be screenshots and screen captures from the Bloomberg Terminal,

the other thing that I want to mention is that when i'm searching the materials sector, I'm alternating the columns between the GICS and BICS classification systems.


...





...

It really annoys me when the weather is hot and windy, because I want to keep the window open when it's hot, but the shades won't stop moving when it's windy and the window is open. I'm thinking about Sunday, and what to do on Sunday. I didn't apply for any internships or positions since I last wrote about wanting to find one. There's this endless competition between my desire to work on things of personal interest and things of professional interest, and educational pursuits are kind of a combination of both, or maybe educational pursuits are at the intersection of personal interests and professional interests. 

...

One thing about putting notes on my blog from sources around the internet is that I think it might make more sense to take screenshots of what I find, rather than copying and pasting the material because I file copyrights on the text from my blog, and I obviously can't file a copyright claim for text that I didn't write myself, so to prevent me from accidentally filing a copyright claim on someone else's content, I'll just make a reference to other people's content using screenshots, rather than copying and pasting the text.

There is also this other issue with inserting images into my blog. The issue involves where the lines break, and I guess I just figured out what happens. so I guess I answered the question to the issue that I was having. so there.

The sector analysis paper is due before the 
Bloomberg Certification is due, so, I guess 
I'll get started on that first.

i went out to eat. i was on campus for
several hours doing course work. what else?
I think that I'm going to work on something.

when I got home after going out to eat. and
spending time on campus. and then going
out to eat again, i um. had trouble turning
on my laptop and i was really frustrated
about it. but i eventually got it turned out.

...

I'm tired. and hungry.
it's 330 am.
what could i eat?

...

I submitted a copyright claim for the previous post
and I'm thinking that for this post I'll just make it
one big
well
what i'm thinking is that i'll take a different
approach to how i format this post and
i think that i'm going to skip out on creating

lines between newer content and older content
and i'm not sure how this will look or how it will
appear. but i guess i'll see.

nah. you know what. now that i think about it. i do
have to create marks that separate one train of
thought from another train of thought and kind
of demarcate where one train of though begins
and where one ends. so

never mind.
well. i kind of want to head back to campus to
get some work done at the library. i think that today
i spent about 3 hours in the lab. i went to lunch at

11 AM, arrived at campus around 1 PM and left
at around 4 PM. or a little after.

there is an event at the stadium and it's packed and loud
and noisy and i think that i'll wait it out for now. i did
get an email from the student newspaper, and it had
an article or an advertisement of an information
section about student housing options that are on
campus, and i think that i'll explore those at some
point.

Notes Taken During My First Semester at the University of Texas at Arlington

...

Annotation to Notes from Arlington # 65

This was written during my June Road trip. It's September 25th, 2022, and I'm back in Tennessee. 

...

Archived Content 09/25/2022 06:13 PM 

...

i stayed in Somerville tn for a night. im in the next town over, and i already feel like just staying here.

...

today is sunday. my thinking is that the roads should be empty, and it would be a good idea to keep driving.

...

i cant really go back to texas anyway. but i dont really know where to go.

...

maybe it was just time to leave texas. i had been there for 2 years. maybe it was just time for me to go. i really don't know what to do about college though.

...

i think that im just going to relocate. 
i'm on the Arkansas side of Memphis. 
i honestly don't know where the hell to go.

Everywhere is a fucking nightmare.
the nightmare never ends.
I really can't go back to Texas.

I have to leave texas. I really do.
I don't really know where to go, though.
this was a fabulous waste of money.

I threw away as much of my stuff as I could.
and threw away additional stuff on my way here.

I'll probably throw away 
additional stuff here 
and there
on my way to where 
ever the hell I end up.

i don't really know where 
the fuck to go at
this point.

I'm facing one frustration after another.

...

I'm really having a hard time getting my business in a more formalized state. I have the various things that I need to do on my calendar, but, sometimes there is no telling if I will get anything done or not, or if I'll get distracted by this or that issue, or, you know, who knows what will happen. I'm still facing a number of different challenges. and stuff. You know, like this and that stuff.

...

Class Notes Starting September 14th, 2022

one thing that I often face that impedes my ability to get anything done is the avalanche of emails that I have to deal with, or that fall into my mail box. I obviously don't read them all, but I usually scan them to see if they contain anything important.

...

Thinking. I'm going to hold off on looking for work right now. or looking for an internship or anything like that.

I really should just be focusing on school right now.


...

what else is on my mind? Just facing quite a few challenges lately. It seems as though everywhere I go, someone or another tries to instigate a reaction. and it isn't always clear to me why.

...

June
July 
and 
August

were kind of a blur

same for the first part of September. I think that I went on four road trips this year. really long fucking road trips.

...

Notes from Arlington, Texas # 68

I better not buy anything that I don't need. I thought about buying a few wallets online, but I'm going to hold off on that for now.

Annotation to Notes from Arlington, Texas # 68

I really spent way too much money during these last few months. I really need to make my best effort to stay in school, otherwise I'm more or less fucked.

and again.

I really don't know how I'll be able to balance working and going to college at the same time. This might be a pain in the neck, but I also might be able to make this happen. Who knows.

...

















...

Note: This is kind of a running page of notes.

...

I really don't want to wear hats anymore. I feel like they give me a headache. One thing I realize from being in Texas for several years now, is that, it's hot, and humid, and it's really easy to get sweaty and smelly.

...

I would like to think up a new series title, but I really can't come up with anything. I really can't think of anything.

...

This is where the orange juice 
sends the lemonade to the martini. 
this is where the mimosa and the 
mojito drink and eat and feel 
the ends of the earth.

...

okay, so here is the issue. currently. i might be able to get some work done, but i'm not entirely sure about that. it's fifty-fifty.

...

Note: This is kind of a running page of notes.

...

it can be kind of difficult to get anything done around here. a total fucking nightmare. I doubt that any of us can really get anything done.


it's kind of such a nightmare. to get anything done/ it can



\

Placeholder, still h

...

im not an indolent moron, nor am i an insolent ingrate. im tired. thats it. i guess it's a smoking room.

i ended up smoking in the room anyway. dont worry. i didnt have any fucking food. so i ate the nearest thing available. 

anyway. i know it took me a while to return to dallas, but, i figured that time was not of the essence, since compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe.

however. i have to figure something out. i cant find my fucking calculator. i havent upgraded since 1989. i dont even know if i still have that thing. shit.

...

always. if i visit Kentucky. i invariably manage to take the route back to dallas that passes through nashville. or vice versa, like last month.

...

This is the Third Time, September 3rd, 2022

anyway.

kenneth larot yamat is currently subject to a nondisclosure agreement with an undisclosed party.

should any specific remarks be made about his complete inability to perform cunnilingus from monday 7:02 AM to monday 7:77 AM be discussed with anyone other than the appropriate parties invloved, he will be in violation of said non-disclosure agreement, the breach of which will require significant compensation in the form of additional specific performance of additional cunnilingus or additional performance based compensation in the form of substantially more intense cunnilingus for the remainder of the current artistic performance of completely unsatisfactory cunnilingus, requiring an additional cunnilingus session performed with all deliberate haste.

should he smell like anything other than pussy juice upon his return to his current residence, he will be subject to nothing less than multiple additional performances of additional cunnilingus. 

...

some young man made a defamatory remark a while ago. young. but thats the way it goes for kids his age. well. he left. so.

well. any chance he could. you know. he is.

...

i dont know whats up. but. i think someone out there is accomplishment blocking me. i tried to head back to texas so that i could attend class in person, however, as soon as i left indiana, there was a fucking monsoon, or fucking invasion from outer space consisting primarily of rain drops, which kept falling on my head. so i put on my hat.

i dont feel like drowning to death. right now. i asked the sheriff for directions, he said theres a hotel in the big city. i got there. and there was no hotel. i guess i should have asked the deputy, but either he didnt have a deputy, or the deputy was in invisible mode. so.

...

When I think about. I don't know what to say.

this is the third road trip in 3 months. i'm tired. and. im just so irritable.

i want to be nice, but, sometimes i end up in places i dont really want to be.

i really don't want to withdraw from school. i think that the discipline i'm pursuing is an important one.

i just don't know why i face the challenges that i face.

but this third road trip. really. even though it has been a nightmare, i don't think that the outcome will be as terrible as.

i just don't know what to say.

i really want to finish the program. im heading all the way back to texas. again.







...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

but the .prn file that i was trying to open earlier was probably from a spreadsheet that was exported from someone's pocket calculator, and then uploaded to where i can download it.


...







 
...

 





...










...

today is tuesday. what did i get done today?

so. i think i figured something out to the internship / work search issue.

i'm going to use the bloomberg terminal.

anyway.

that's exactly what i tried to do this morning. 

i figured that. since today is tuesday. i can work on something other than coursework.

so i worked on the work search.

i didn't know where to start,
but

only in the sense that i didn't know
where
i wanted to start.

so i just started exploring the tabs.

anyway. a lot of the companies that i'm interested in don't really have any openings. many don't even have a career page.

so.

i just mailed out a bunch of hand written letters.

the first company I called up. i mentioned that they were listed on the campus job board, but when i went to their website, they didn't even have a career page.

the person who answered the phone mentioned that they didn't have any openings, and they rarely have open positions.

so i figured i'd mail them a letter, saying that i'm interested in working for their company one day.

...

what's on my mind right now? Tuesday. tomorrow is tuesday.

...

it was kind of tedious, but I did it. i really have to figure out how to put this into words. but I went ticker by ticker. i mean. it didn't take a hell of a lot of time, but it really was tedious. really tedious.

...

There was one silly issue that I had because, I don't know what this would be refered to in the spreadsheet application that I typically use, but:

It's Called Freeze Panes / Freeze Rows.

Silly.

...

So here is one thing. I need to use two sources, I need to use Bloomberg for the Expected Returns, and I need to use State Street for the weights within the index.

see screenshot below.

I'm trying to highlight how I'm using the information from both sources, Bloomberg and State Street.

...





...

Below is a screenshot of the "custom" tab for the watchlist analytics function, and I'm wanting to put in a formula, but I don't know how to format formulas for the Bloomberg Terminal.

the issue is i want to be able to do Excel Stuff without opening Excel.

...











...

okay. so there are more screenshots here than i can really discuss.

i'm looking at the watchlist analytics for S5INDU and S5MATR in the Bloomberg terminal.

There is one thing that I'm interested in. and it's the tap at the far right that says "Custom"

I tried working with it, but, I haven't come up with anything.
...

 






...


i think that i figured something out.

...

















...


S5INDU is the ticker of the industrials index - XLI is the ETF that tracks the materials index
S5MATR is the ticker of the materials index - XLB is the ETF that tracks the materials index


...

so what was it?

it was odd. 

the sectors i intended on focusing on was materials.

how it works in this class is that industrials and materials are grouped together for the purposes of group assignments.

i remember when sectors were being assigned, the person who is my current group partner called out industrials, and i called out materials.

so i was under the impression that my group partner would want to work the industrials sector.

but when we spoke today, my group partner mentioned wanting to focus on materials.

but when we had minor group work together, my group partner went into the industrial set first, and then the materials set next.

this isn't a problem. really. but, i just don't know. if this is going to continue to oscillate back and forth or what.

what i'm thinking is. it really might not matter, the reason being that even though i might like materials, if.

well

it just shouldn't matter if i look at industrials or materials.

...

so what happened the other night? well, i was at the library later, I think about 45 minutes after midnight, I wanted to get a bunch of stuff done, but, I was tired, and there seem to be as many distractions during the night as there are during the day.

anyway. I want to continue working on my paper.

so in the example student paper, correlations are drawn between the index performance of the financials index, as well as the performance of the real estate index.

what what should I look at in my case?

what I'm thinking about is looking at the various correlations between the materials sector and various commodities.

so in the screenshot below i'm looking at the historical beta for the materials index and the

i think this is brent crude?

let me look.

okay, so it's WTI crude, but what does that mean?

...

















...

now what the hell was i thinking about? I think that i'm somewhat tired, and i'll come back to this later. it's just usually so crowded around here that I really can't get anything done, and I think that it's more or less the same issue.

...

well, i think that i've found something that I can amuse myself with whenever i think that i'm becoming distracted.

...

but it's basically this. I have an idea, and it is an amazing idea, and I think that most people will be impressed by it, if it can be executed in a way that people find interesting, and I think that most people will find it interesting because even when I just think about it, I'm intersted in it myself, and you think that most people will be interested in it, but, they probably won't be interested in it because it is such a trivial thing to pursue.

here is what I think about most things.

...

I can't figure out what the hell I was working on earlier, but I have found something that I'm interested in. I really have, and I think that I want to explore more of what I'm doing with this. and this should be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to the universe, and people all around the universe will be amazed with what I'm about to produce, and I will be quoted the universe over, by other sentient life forms, and even non-living forms of sentience, 

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

I'm going to look at the components in the materials sector of the  S&P 1500 index.

...

Well. truth is. I'm not sure where I was going to go with bond yields for the materials sector, I think what I wanted to do was to check into.

I guess somehow figure how sensitive the materials sector is to interest rates. I could probably use the other chart to figure out a correlation between the two.

like um. ten year treasuries and xlb.

but i'm sure that. um. 

i really want something more accurate.

I want to figure out what each company is actually paying in terms of interest coupon payments and how this interacts.

but i'm going to forget about this for now and look at something else. but what was it though? for whatever reason I can't recall what the hell I was thinking about.

...

I wanted to look at something, but I'm not sure where I'm going with this. What I think I was trying to look up, was.

I wanted to search. something like bonds. or. i wanted to see how the bond yields compare for companies listed in the materials sector, and compare these to dividend yields for the same companies, but here is the thing.

I'm not sure if this would really mean anything. I'm 

I guess. I'm currently under the assumption. that the bond yields should be comparable to the dividend yields, but I'm not sure why I'm assuming this. I guess, I'm not sure what makes me think that the bond yields should be comparable, so I'm not sure why I would want to figure out if the information in the Bloomberg terminal would either confirm my assumption or suspicion or hypothesis or what.

there are other things that I kind of want to look into here as well.

...

anyway. I think that this is as much note taking as I'm going to do for the day, and then I'm going to head home.

...

So I think this is the 5 year Volatility and Risk analysis, and the citation for this screenshot should be styled as:

S5MATR Index Historical Beta 5 YR, via Bloomberg LP, Accessed August 28, 2022

Notes:

Historical Beta

and 

Regression Analysis

are the same thing.

I think, unless I'm missing something.

What I mean is, it seems that when a person is trying to determine the historical beta of an index, or some other security against a benchmark

it's the same thing as performing a regression analysis of an index or some other security against a benchmark,

and it's possible that I already learned this at some point in the past

or maybe someone already told me this before, or maybe I came across this somewhere or another.

anyway.

the reason I'm fussing over this mentally is that the other day I said something like:



"So I would basically pay twice as much for the full set, right?"

and then the guy said

"No, you would just pay double for all four over the quoted price of just two."

and this is always annoying because, it's possible that two people are saying the same thing using different words, but there is always one person in any conversation who really doesn't understand that the same thing can be said in multiple ways. 


...

















...

I figured out how to put all four of the things I'm looking at into a single chart, the only thing is, is that it isn't very interesting to look at.

SPX Index Comparative Returns, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP Accessed August 28, 2022 

so the part of the assignment that I'm trying to work on has me look at: 

Price Performance, Total Return Analysis, Volatility and Risk Analysis, and Those are for YTD and 3YR Periods

and Positive Alpha over a 5 year period.
...

















...

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

XLB US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPY US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022



...



















...

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

the issue here is that I need to put the total return for both indices into a single graph, and not have 2 separate graphs, but I forgot how to do that.

anyway, as far as citation styling goes, I think that I would style the first as:

S5MATR Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...



















...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of: 

(Bloomberg, 2022)

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

one is that I want to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource, and if possible, the only resource,

and

I want to keep whatever graphics and images and charts that I use in the paper and class presentation to be screenshots and screen captures from the Bloomberg Terminal,

the other thing that I want to mention is that when i'm searching the materials sector, I'm alternating the columns between the GICS and BICS classification systems.


...





...

It really annoys me when the weather is hot and windy, because I want to keep the window open when it's hot, but the shades won't stop moving when it's windy and the window is open. I'm thinking about Sunday, and what to do on Sunday. I didn't apply for any internships or positions since I last wrote about wanting to find one. There's this endless competition between my desire to work on things of personal interest and things of professional interest, and educational pursuits are kind of a combination of both, or maybe educational pursuits are at the intersection of personal interests and professional interests. 

...

One thing about putting notes on my blog from sources around the internet is that I think it might make more sense to take screenshots of what I find, rather than copying and pasting the material because I file copyrights on the text from my blog, and I obviously can't file a copyright claim for text that I didn't write myself, so to prevent me from accidentally filing a copyright claim on someone else's content, I'll just make a reference to other people's content using screenshots, rather than copying and pasting the text.

There is also this other issue with inserting images into my blog. The issue involves where the lines break, and I guess I just figured out what happens. so I guess I answered the question to the issue that I was having. so there.

...
...

The sector analysis paper is due before the Bloomberg Certification is due, so, I guess I'll get started on that first.

 i went out to eat. i was on campus for
several hours doing course work. what else?

when I got home after going out to eat. and

there is an event at the stadium and it's packed and loud

Back Home, September 9th, 2022

Back Home, September 9th, 2022

i dont know what happened the other day. but i seemed to have irritated the bartender at this pizza place i went to. i really didn't understand what happened.

she seemed upset about something. she said that she wanted me to leave. so i paid and left.

a guy chased after me, and said: "No one here thinks that's funny."

and i still have no idea what i did, or what offense i committed.

i remember, i asked where the basil was, and a woman behind me said:

"the toppings are placed underneath the cheese here."

and i responded: "you're right about that, i've eaten here before."

and then i just sort of went at it with my pizza,

and then the bartender became upset.

my nails were dirty, really dirty, and i was eating two slices of pizza at a time. like a pig.

and maybe that was the thing, she was irritated that i was eating like a pig.

but.

i think that i was eating with a fork and knife first, and then
i started eating with my hands.

maybe i should just change my major or something.

i really fucking wanted to go to school, but, i don't really know what the hell to do.

...

Notes, Thoughts, and Reflections While Using the Bloomberg Terminal 





...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

but the .prn file that i was trying to open earlier was probably from a spreadsheet that was exported from someone's pocket calculator, and then uploaded to where i can download it.

...

today is tuesday. what did i get done today?

so. i think i figured something out to the internship / work search issue.

i'm going to use the bloomberg terminal.

anyway.

that's exactly what i tried to do this morning. 

i figured that. since today is tuesday. i can work on something other than coursework.

so i worked on the work search.

i didn't know where to start,
but

only in the sense that i didn't know
where
i wanted to start.

so i just started exploring the tabs.

anyway. a lot of the companies that i'm interested in don't really have any openings. many don't even have a career page.

so.

i just mailed out a bunch of hand written letters.

the first company I called up. i mentioned that they were listed on the campus job board, but when i went to their website, they didn't even have a career page.

the person who answered the phone mentioned that they didn't have any openings, and they rarely have open positions.

so i figured i'd mail them a letter, saying that i'm interested in working for their company one day.

...

what's on my mind right now? Tuesday. tomorrow is tuesday.

...

it was kind of tedious, but I did it. i really have to figure out how to put this into words. but I went ticker by ticker. i mean. it didn't take a hell of a lot of time, but it really was tedious. really tedious.

...

There was one silly issue that I had because, I don't know what this would be refered to in the spreadsheet application that I typically use, but:

It's Called Freeze Panes / Freeze Rows.

Silly.

...

So here is one thing. I need to use two sources, I need to use Bloomberg for the Expected Returns, and I need to use State Street for the weights within the index.

see screenshot below.

I'm trying to highlight how I'm using the information from both sources, Bloomberg and State Street.

...





...

Below is a screenshot of the "custom" tab for the watchlist analytics function, and I'm wanting to put in a formula, but I don't know how to format formulas for the Bloomberg Terminal.

the issue is i want to be able to do Excel Stuff without opening Excel.

...











...

okay. so there are more screenshots here than i can really discuss.

i'm looking at the watchlist analytics for S5INDU and S5MATR in the Bloomberg terminal.

There is one thing that I'm interested in. and it's the tap at the far right that says "Custom"

I tried working with it, but, I haven't come up with anything.
...

 






...


i think that i figured something out.

...

















...


S5INDU is the ticker of the industrials index - XLI is the ETF that tracks the materials index
S5MATR is the ticker of the materials index - XLB is the ETF that tracks the materials index


...

so what was it?

it was odd. 

the sectors i intended on focusing on was materials.

how it works in this class is that industrials and materials are grouped together for the purposes of group assignments.

i remember when sectors were being assigned, the person who is my current group partner called out industrials, and i called out materials.

so i was under the impression that my group partner would want to work the industrials sector.

but when we spoke today, my group partner mentioned wanting to focus on materials.

but when we had minor group work together, my group partner went into the industrial set first, and then the materials set next.

this isn't a problem. really. but, i just don't know. if this is going to continue to oscillate back and forth or what.

what i'm thinking is. it really might not matter, the reason being that even though i might like materials, if.

well

it just shouldn't matter if i look at industrials or materials.

...

so what happened the other night? well, i was at the library later, I think about 45 minutes after midnight, I wanted to get a bunch of stuff done, but, I was tired, and there seem to be as many distractions during the night as there are during the day.

anyway. I want to continue working on my paper.

so in the example student paper, correlations are drawn between the index performance of the financials index, as well as the performance of the real estate index.

what what should I look at in my case?

what I'm thinking about is looking at the various correlations between the materials sector and various commodities.

so in the screenshot below i'm looking at the historical beta for the materials index and the

i think this is brent crude?

let me look.

okay, so it's WTI crude, but what does that mean?

...

















...

now what the hell was i thinking about? I think that i'm somewhat tired, and i'll come back to this later. it's just usually so crowded around here that I really can't get anything done, and I think that it's more or less the same issue.

...

well, i think that i've found something that I can amuse myself with whenever i think that i'm becoming distracted.

...

but it's basically this. I have an idea, and it is an amazing idea, and I think that most people will be impressed by it, if it can be executed in a way that people find interesting, and I think that most people will find it interesting because even when I just think about it, I'm intersted in it myself, and you think that most people will be interested in it, but, they probably won't be interested in it because it is such a trivial thing to pursue.

here is what I think about most things.

...

I can't figure out what the hell I was working on earlier, but I have found something that I'm interested in. I really have, and I think that I want to explore more of what I'm doing with this. and this should be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to the universe, and people all around the universe will be amazed with what I'm about to produce, and I will be quoted the universe over, by other sentient life forms, and even non-living forms of sentience, 

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

I'm going to look at the components in the materials sector of the  S&P 1500 index.

...

Well. truth is. I'm not sure where I was going to go with bond yields for the materials sector, I think what I wanted to do was to check into.

I guess somehow figure how sensitive the materials sector is to interest rates. I could probably use the other chart to figure out a correlation between the two.

like um. ten year treasuries and xlb.

but i'm sure that. um. 

i really want something more accurate.

I want to figure out what each company is actually paying in terms of interest coupon payments and how this interacts.

but i'm going to forget about this for now and look at something else. but what was it though? for whatever reason I can't recall what the hell I was thinking about.

...

I wanted to look at something, but I'm not sure where I'm going with this. What I think I was trying to look up, was.

I wanted to search. something like bonds. or. i wanted to see how the bond yields compare for companies listed in the materials sector, and compare these to dividend yields for the same companies, but here is the thing.

I'm not sure if this would really mean anything. I'm 

I guess. I'm currently under the assumption. that the bond yields should be comparable to the dividend yields, but I'm not sure why I'm assuming this. I guess, I'm not sure what makes me think that the bond yields should be comparable, so I'm not sure why I would want to figure out if the information in the Bloomberg terminal would either confirm my assumption or suspicion or hypothesis or what.

there are other things that I kind of want to look into here as well.

...

anyway. I think that this is as much note taking as I'm going to do for the day, and then I'm going to head home.

...

So I think this is the 5 year Volatility and Risk analysis, and the citation for this screenshot should be styled as:

S5MATR Index Historical Beta 5 YR, via Bloomberg LP, Accessed August 28, 2022

Notes:

Historical Beta

and 

Regression Analysis

are the same thing.

I think, unless I'm missing something.

What I mean is, it seems that when a person is trying to determine the historical beta of an index, or some other security against a benchmark

it's the same thing as performing a regression analysis of an index or some other security against a benchmark,

and it's possible that I already learned this at some point in the past

or maybe someone already told me this before, or maybe I came across this somewhere or another.

anyway.

the reason I'm fussing over this mentally is that the other day I said something like:



"So I would basically pay twice as much for the full set, right?"

and then the guy said

"No, you would just pay double for all four over the quoted price of just two."

and this is always annoying because, it's possible that two people are saying the same thing using different words, but there is always one person in any conversation who really doesn't understand that the same thing can be said in multiple ways. 


...

















...

I figured out how to put all four of the things I'm looking at into a single chart, the only thing is, is that it isn't very interesting to look at.

SPX Index Comparative Returns, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP Accessed August 28, 2022 

so the part of the assignment that I'm trying to work on has me look at: 

Price Performance, Total Return Analysis, Volatility and Risk Analysis, and Those are for YTD and 3YR Periods

and Positive Alpha over a 5 year period.
...

















...

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

XLB US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPY US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022



...



















...

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

the issue here is that I need to put the total return for both indices into a single graph, and not have 2 separate graphs, but I forgot how to do that.

anyway, as far as citation styling goes, I think that I would style the first as:

S5MATR Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...



















...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of: 

(Bloomberg, 2022)

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

one is that I want to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource, and if possible, the only resource,

and

I want to keep whatever graphics and images and charts that I use in the paper and class presentation to be screenshots and screen captures from the Bloomberg Terminal,

the other thing that I want to mention is that when i'm searching the materials sector, I'm alternating the columns between the GICS and BICS classification systems.


...





...

It really annoys me when the weather is hot and windy, because I want to keep the window open when it's hot, but the shades won't stop moving when it's windy and the window is open. I'm thinking about Sunday, and what to do on Sunday. I didn't apply for any internships or positions since I last wrote about wanting to find one. There's this endless competition between my desire to work on things of personal interest and things of professional interest, and educational pursuits are kind of a combination of both, or maybe educational pursuits are at the intersection of personal interests and professional interests. 

...

One thing about putting notes on my blog from sources around the internet is that I think it might make more sense to take screenshots of what I find, rather than copying and pasting the material because I file copyrights on the text from my blog, and I obviously can't file a copyright claim for text that I didn't write myself, so to prevent me from accidentally filing a copyright claim on someone else's content, I'll just make a reference to other people's content using screenshots, rather than copying and pasting the text.

There is also this other issue with inserting images into my blog. The issue involves where the lines break, and I guess I just figured out what happens. so I guess I answered the question to the issue that I was having. so there.

...





...
...

The sector analysis paper is due before the Bloomberg Certification is due, so, I guess I'll get started on that first.
...


...

 i went out to eat. i was on campus for
several hours doing course work. what else?
I think that I'm going to work on something.


when I got home after going out to eat. and
spending time on campus. and then going
out to eat again, i um. had trouble turning
on my laptop and i was really frustrated
about it. but i eventually got it turned out.




...


I'm tired. and hungry.
it's 330 am.
what could i eat?


...

I submitted a copyright claim for the previous post
and I'm thinking that for this post I'll just make it
one big
well
what i'm thinking is that i'll take a different
approach to how i format this post and
i think that i'm going to skip out on creating


lines between newer content and older content
and i'm not sure how this will look or how it will
appear. but i guess i'll see.


nah. you know what. now that i think about it. i do
have to create marks that separate one train of
thought from another train of thought and kind
of demarcate where one train of though begins
and where one ends. so


never mind.
well. i kind of want to head back to campus to
get some work done at the library. i think that today
i spent about 3 hours in the lab. i went to lunch at


11 AM, arrived at campus around 1 PM and left
at around 4 PM. or a little after.


there is an event at the stadium and it's packed and loud
and noisy and i think that i'll wait it out for now. i did
get an email from the student newspaper, and it had
an article or an advertisement of an information
section about student housing options that are on
campus, and i think that i'll explore those at some
point.

Class Notes Starting September 14th, 2022

one thing that I often face that impedes my ability to get anything done is the avalanche of emails that I have to deal with, or that fall into my mail box. I obviously don't read them all, but I usually scan them to see if they contain anything important.

...

Thinking. I'm going to hold off on looking for work right now. or looking for an internship or anything like that.

I really should just be focusing on school right now.


...

what else is on my mind? Just facing quite a few challenges lately. It seems as though everywhere I go, someone or another tries to instigate a reaction. and it isn't always clear to me why.

...

June
July 
and 
August

were kind of a blur

same for the first part of September. I think that I went on four road trips this year. really long fucking road trips.



...

















...

Note: This is kind of a running page of notes.

...

I really don't want to wear hats anymore. I feel like they give me a headache. One thing I realize from being in Texas for several years now, is that, it's hot, and humid, and it's really easy to get sweaty and smelly.

...

I would like to think up a new series title, but I really can't come up with anything. I really can't think of anything.

...

This is where the orange juice 
sends the lemonade to the martini. 
this is where the mimosa and the 
mojito drink and eat and feel 
the ends of the earth.

...

okay, so here is the issue. currently. i might be able to get some work done, but i'm not entirely sure about that. it's fifty-fifty.

...

Note: This is kind of a running page of notes.

...

it can be kind of difficult to get anything done around here. a total fucking nightmare. I doubt that any of us can really get anything done.


it's kind of such a nightmare. to get anything done/ it can

Placeholder, still h

...

im not an indolent moron, nor am i an insolent ingrate. im tired. thats it. i guess it's a smoking room.

i ended up smoking in the room anyway. dont worry. i didnt have any fucking food. so i ate the nearest thing available. 

anyway. i know it took me a while to return to dallas, but, i figured that time was not of the essence, since compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe.

however. i have to figure something out. i cant find my fucking calculator. i havent upgraded since 1989. i dont even know if i still have that thing. shit.

...

always. if i visit Kentucky. i invariably manage to take the route back to dallas that passes through nashville. or vice versa, like last month.

...

This is the Third Time, September 3rd, 2022

anyway.

kenneth larot yamat is currently subject to a nondisclosure agreement with an undisclosed party.

should any specific remarks be made about his complete inability to perform cunnilingus from monday 7:02 AM to monday 7:77 AM be discussed with anyone other than the appropriate parties invloved, he will be in violation of said non-disclosure agreement, the breach of which will require significant compensation in the form of additional specific performance of additional cunnilingus or additional performance based compensation in the form of substantially more intense cunnilingus for the remainder of the current artistic performance of completely unsatisfactory cunnilingus, requiring an additional cunnilingus session performed with all deliberate haste.

should he smell like anything other than pussy juice upon his return to his current residence, he will be subject to nothing less than multiple additional performances of additional cunnilingus. 

...

some young man made a defamatory remark a while ago. young. but thats the way it goes for kids his age. well. he left. so.

well. any chance he could. you know. he is.

...

i dont know whats up. but. i think someone out there is accomplishment blocking me. i tried to head back to texas so that i could attend class in person, however, as soon as i left indiana, there was a fucking monsoon, or fucking invasion from outer space consisting primarily of rain drops, which kept falling on my head. so i put on my hat.

i dont feel like drowning to death. right now. i asked the sheriff for directions, he said theres a hotel in the big city. i got there. and there was no hotel. i guess i should have asked the deputy, but either he didnt have a deputy, or the deputy was in invisible mode. so.

...

When I think about. I don't know what to say.

this is the third road trip in 3 months. i'm tired. and. im just so irritable.

i want to be nice, but, sometimes i end up in places i dont really want to be.

i really don't want to withdraw from school. i think that the discipline i'm pursuing is an important one.

i just don't know why i face the challenges that i face.

but this third road trip. really. even though it has been a nightmare, i don't think that the outcome will be as terrible as.

i just don't know what to say.

i really want to finish the program. im heading all the way back to texas. again.







...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

but the .prn file that i was trying to open earlier was probably from a spreadsheet that was exported from someone's pocket calculator, and then uploaded to where i can download it.

XLB US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPY US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022



...



















...

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

the issue here is that I need to put the total return for both indices into a single graph, and not have 2 separate graphs, but I forgot how to do that.

anyway, as far as citation styling goes, I think that I would style the first as:

S5MATR Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...



















...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of: 

(Bloomberg, 2022)

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

one is that I want to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource, and if possible, the only resource,

and

I want to keep whatever graphics and images and charts that I use in the paper and class presentation to be screenshots and screen captures from the Bloomberg Terminal,

the other thing that I want to mention is that when i'm searching the materials sector, I'm alternating the columns between the GICS and BICS classification systems.


...





...

It really annoys me when the weather is hot and windy, because I want to keep the window open when it's hot, but the shades won't stop moving when it's windy and the window is open. I'm thinking about Sunday, and what to do on Sunday. I didn't apply for any internships or positions since I last wrote about wanting to find one. There's this endless competition between my desire to work on things of personal interest and things of professional interest, and educational pursuits are kind of a combination of both, or maybe educational pursuits are at the intersection of personal interests and professional interests. 

...

One thing about putting notes on my blog from sources around the internet is that I think it might make more sense to take screenshots of what I find, rather than copying and pasting the material because I file copyrights on the text from my blog, and I obviously can't file a copyright claim for text that I didn't write myself, so to prevent me from accidentally filing a copyright claim on someone else's content, I'll just make a reference to other people's content using screenshots, rather than copying and pasting the text.

There is also this other issue with inserting images into my blog. The issue involves where the lines break, and I guess I just figured out what happens. so I guess I answered the question to the issue that I was having. so there.

...





...
...

The sector analysis paper is due before the Bloomberg Certification is due, so, I guess I'll get started on that first.
...


...

 i went out to eat. i was on campus for
several hours doing course work. what else?
I think that I'm going to work on something.


when I got home after going out to eat. and
spending time on campus. and then going
out to eat again, i um. had trouble turning
on my laptop and i was really frustrated
about it. but i eventually got it turned out.




...


I'm tired. and hungry.
it's 330 am.
what could i eat?


...

I submitted a copyright claim for the previous post
and I'm thinking that for this post I'll just make it
one big
well
what i'm thinking is that i'll take a different
approach to how i format this post and
i think that i'm going to skip out on creating


lines between newer content and older content
and i'm not sure how this will look or how it will
appear. but i guess i'll see.


nah. you know what. now that i think about it. i do
have to create marks that separate one train of
thought from another train of thought and kind
of demarcate where one train of though begins
and where one ends. so


never mind.
well. i kind of want to head back to campus to
get some work done at the library. i think that today
i spent about 3 hours in the lab. i went to lunch at


11 AM, arrived at campus around 1 PM and left
at around 4 PM. or a little after.


there is an event at the stadium and it's packed and loud
and noisy and i think that i'll wait it out for now. i did
get an email from the student newspaper, and it had
an article or an advertisement of an information
section about student housing options that are on
campus, and i think that i'll explore those at some
point.

Back Home, September 9th, 2022

i dont know what happened the other day. but i seemed to have irritated the bartender at this pizza place i went to. i really didn't understand what happened.

she seemed upset about something. she said that she wanted me to leave. so i paid and left.

a guy chased after me, and said: "No one here thinks that's funny."

and i still have no idea what i did, or what offense i committed.

i remember, i asked where the basil was, and a woman behind me said:

"the toppings are placed underneath the cheese here."

and i responded: "you're right about that, i've eaten here before."

and then i just sort of went at it with my pizza,

and then the bartender became upset.

my nails were dirty, really dirty, and i was eating two slices of pizza at a time. like a pig.

and maybe that was the thing, she was irritated that i was eating like a pig.

but.

i think that i was eating with a fork and knife first, and then
i started eating with my hands.

maybe i should just change my major or something.

i really fucking wanted to go to school, but, i don't really know what the hell to do.

Notes, Thoughts, and Reflections While Using the Bloomberg Terminal 





...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

but the .prn file that i was trying to open earlier was probably from a spreadsheet that was exported from someone's pocket calculator, and then uploaded to where i can download it.


...







 
...

 





...










...

today is tuesday. what did i get done today?

so. i think i figured something out to the internship / work search issue.

i'm going to use the bloomberg terminal.

anyway.

that's exactly what i tried to do this morning. 

i figured that. since today is tuesday. i can work on something other than coursework.

so i worked on the work search.

i didn't know where to start,
but

only in the sense that i didn't know
where
i wanted to start.

so i just started exploring the tabs.

anyway. a lot of the companies that i'm interested in don't really have any openings. many don't even have a career page.

so.

i just mailed out a bunch of hand written letters.

the first company I called up. i mentioned that they were listed on the campus job board, but when i went to their website, they didn't even have a career page.

the person who answered the phone mentioned that they didn't have any openings, and they rarely have open positions.

so i figured i'd mail them a letter, saying that i'm interested in working for their company one day.

...

what's on my mind right now? Tuesday. tomorrow is tuesday.

...

it was kind of tedious, but I did it. i really have to figure out how to put this into words. but I went ticker by ticker. i mean. it didn't take a hell of a lot of time, but it really was tedious. really tedious.

...

There was one silly issue that I had because, I don't know what this would be refered to in the spreadsheet application that I typically use, but:

It's Called Freeze Panes / Freeze Rows.

Silly.

...

So here is one thing. I need to use two sources, I need to use Bloomberg for the Expected Returns, and I need to use State Street for the weights within the index.

see screenshot below.

I'm trying to highlight how I'm using the information from both sources, Bloomberg and State Street.

...





...

Below is a screenshot of the "custom" tab for the watchlist analytics function, and I'm wanting to put in a formula, but I don't know how to format formulas for the Bloomberg Terminal.

the issue is i want to be able to do Excel Stuff without opening Excel.

...











...

okay. so there are more screenshots here than i can really discuss.

i'm looking at the watchlist analytics for S5INDU and S5MATR in the Bloomberg terminal.

There is one thing that I'm interested in. and it's the tap at the far right that says "Custom"

I tried working with it, but, I haven't come up with anything.
...

 






...


i think that i figured something out.

...

















...


S5INDU is the ticker of the industrials index - XLI is the ETF that tracks the materials index
S5MATR is the ticker of the materials index - XLB is the ETF that tracks the materials index


...

so what was it?

it was odd. 

the sectors i intended on focusing on was materials.

how it works in this class is that industrials and materials are grouped together for the purposes of group assignments.

i remember when sectors were being assigned, the person who is my current group partner called out industrials, and i called out materials.

so i was under the impression that my group partner would want to work the industrials sector.

but when we spoke today, my group partner mentioned wanting to focus on materials.

but when we had minor group work together, my group partner went into the industrial set first, and then the materials set next.

this isn't a problem. really. but, i just don't know. if this is going to continue to oscillate back and forth or what.

what i'm thinking is. it really might not matter, the reason being that even though i might like materials, if.

well

it just shouldn't matter if i look at industrials or materials.

...

so what happened the other night? well, i was at the library later, I think about 45 minutes after midnight, I wanted to get a bunch of stuff done, but, I was tired, and there seem to be as many distractions during the night as there are during the day.

anyway. I want to continue working on my paper.

so in the example student paper, correlations are drawn between the index performance of the financials index, as well as the performance of the real estate index.

what what should I look at in my case?

what I'm thinking about is looking at the various correlations between the materials sector and various commodities.

so in the screenshot below i'm looking at the historical beta for the materials index and the

i think this is brent crude?

let me look.

okay, so it's WTI crude, but what does that mean?

...

















...

now what the hell was i thinking about? I think that i'm somewhat tired, and i'll come back to this later. it's just usually so crowded around here that I really can't get anything done, and I think that it's more or less the same issue.

...

well, i think that i've found something that I can amuse myself with whenever i think that i'm becoming distracted.

...

but it's basically this. I have an idea, and it is an amazing idea, and I think that most people will be impressed by it, if it can be executed in a way that people find interesting, and I think that most people will find it interesting because even when I just think about it, I'm intersted in it myself, and you think that most people will be interested in it, but, they probably won't be interested in it because it is such a trivial thing to pursue.

here is what I think about most things.

...

I can't figure out what the hell I was working on earlier, but I have found something that I'm interested in. I really have, and I think that I want to explore more of what I'm doing with this. and this should be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to the universe, and people all around the universe will be amazed with what I'm about to produce, and I will be quoted the universe over, by other sentient life forms, and even non-living forms of sentience, 

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

I'm going to look at the components in the materials sector of the  S&P 1500 index.

...

Well. truth is. I'm not sure where I was going to go with bond yields for the materials sector, I think what I wanted to do was to check into.

I guess somehow figure how sensitive the materials sector is to interest rates. I could probably use the other chart to figure out a correlation between the two.

like um. ten year treasuries and xlb.

but i'm sure that. um. 

i really want something more accurate.

I want to figure out what each company is actually paying in terms of interest coupon payments and how this interacts.

but i'm going to forget about this for now and look at something else. but what was it though? for whatever reason I can't recall what the hell I was thinking about.

...

I wanted to look at something, but I'm not sure where I'm going with this. What I think I was trying to look up, was.

I wanted to search. something like bonds. or. i wanted to see how the bond yields compare for companies listed in the materials sector, and compare these to dividend yields for the same companies, but here is the thing.

I'm not sure if this would really mean anything. I'm 

I guess. I'm currently under the assumption. that the bond yields should be comparable to the dividend yields, but I'm not sure why I'm assuming this. I guess, I'm not sure what makes me think that the bond yields should be comparable, so I'm not sure why I would want to figure out if the information in the Bloomberg terminal would either confirm my assumption or suspicion or hypothesis or what.

there are other things that I kind of want to look into here as well.

...

anyway. I think that this is as much note taking as I'm going to do for the day, and then I'm going to head home.

...

So I think this is the 5 year Volatility and Risk analysis, and the citation for this screenshot should be styled as:

S5MATR Index Historical Beta 5 YR, via Bloomberg LP, Accessed August 28, 2022

Notes:

Historical Beta

and 

Regression Analysis

are the same thing.

I think, unless I'm missing something.

What I mean is, it seems that when a person is trying to determine the historical beta of an index, or some other security against a benchmark

it's the same thing as performing a regression analysis of an index or some other security against a benchmark,

and it's possible that I already learned this at some point in the past

or maybe someone already told me this before, or maybe I came across this somewhere or another.

anyway.

the reason I'm fussing over this mentally is that the other day I said something like:



"So I would basically pay twice as much for the full set, right?"

and then the guy said

"No, you would just pay double for all four over the quoted price of just two."

and this is always annoying because, it's possible that two people are saying the same thing using different words, but there is always one person in any conversation who really doesn't understand that the same thing can be said in multiple ways. 


...

















...

I figured out how to put all four of the things I'm looking at into a single chart, the only thing is, is that it isn't very interesting to look at.

SPX Index Comparative Returns, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP Accessed August 28, 2022 

so the part of the assignment that I'm trying to work on has me look at: 

Price Performance, Total Return Analysis, Volatility and Risk Analysis, and Those are for YTD and 3YR Periods

and Positive Alpha over a 5 year period.
...

















...

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

XLB US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPY US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022



...



















...

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

the issue here is that I need to put the total return for both indices into a single graph, and not have 2 separate graphs, but I forgot how to do that.

anyway, as far as citation styling goes, I think that I would style the first as:

S5MATR Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...



















...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of:

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

her name is katie, and i distinctly remember her having 

blonde hair the last time i came here

this time she berates me for my behavior the last time

i came here, so are 

you going to sit at a booth the next time

you get irritated, 

or are you going to stay where you are?

i tell her i'll stay where I am,

still minutes later. no food. i'm really hungry.

starving. even

she has knockers and she's on collins

i order a bicardi

katie berates me for not having


for having taken a seat elsewhere the last time I was here

i order a tray of 6 naked wings,

but when they arrive they are drenched in
a sweet red sauce?
what is this?

what could this be?
it's sauce!

attitude.
she has an attitude.

it's not that i'm lacking in gratitude.
i'm hungry.

unlike the last time i was here I ate more than
enough.

and you still haven't visted the location in Dallas

the location in dallas is where the largest location is
really. you won't believe how amazing it is.
the largest in the united states, maybe even the world!

Notes from Arlington, Texas # 65

...

I'm in fucking Nashville.

* * *

it's a constant recalibration of what i need to do. filing for unemployment is a total waste of time. filing an unemployment insurance claim is a total waste of time. my claim never gets approved. nightmare. so what the hell do i do?

* * *

There is an issue of. i need to have enough student loan money to cover living expenses. i really don't want to resort to taking out private fucking student loans.

* * *

this is a nightmare. i think that i'll either. i think that i'll file the unemployment claim. and the disability claim.

i'm looking at my electricity bill. 55 fucking kilowatt hours! 10 dollars and 55 fucking cents. i'm home all the time now. so. i just have to figure out what the hell to do over the next few. hell. there really is no telling how long this is going to take. to find work.

if i do have to relocate. yeah. i don't really know.

* * *

i don't know if i should file an additional unemployment claim or what.

* * *

large butts. are part of the large butt industrial complex. small butts. are part of the small butt industrial complex. there are different industries. and there are different industrial complexes. that's just more or less the way that it is. that is more or less the way that it goes. there is something that i was thinking about.

* * *

sometimes designs put us at odds with one another. sometimes designs intentionally put us at odds with one another. i get that quiet spaces are needed. i remember. i found it difficult to accept a work from home position. because. me neighborhood was just too noisy at the time. it was hard to accept calls. it was hard to concentrate on work. it was hard to focus. sometimes it can be hard to focus. sometimes it can be hard to get things done when it's noisy. does it really enhance your concentration. well. who know. i do. i really do need to make a living. and. right now. i just don't think that i can do that. 

i think. it's a conspiracy on the part of the sell things industrial complex. i think that it's part of the industrial goods industrial complex. you have a problem. and we have the solution. i do not want all old things. i want all new things. i don't want a single new thing. i want all old things. i do not want anything other than high prices antiques that are sold by the most respectable antique dealers. and that's the only thing that i want. antiques. antiques. respectable. respectable. 

i remember. there were a few times when i worked in an office setting. and. it was noisy. and. in those cases. i was the noisy one.

* * *

i'm trying to compile my posts for Letters from Sanford Street. and this is the kind of thing that will take some time. what else was i trying to do? well. there was something that i needed to work on, but for some reason. it seems to have slipped my mind. i don't know how to deal with this kind of thing. it's possible that. he might just be trying to get an interview done or something. i have no idea. but he just left. and now this is easier.

i get. i understand that we don't always have our own private work spaces. we don't all have our own offices. and. these quite spaces are really needed. i get that.

part of the reason that i do conduct business. i do work from home when as far as work pertains to Chestnut + Hazel. is because i really don't have money for an office. not right now. any maybe the work from home thing does come with opportunities that can change things.

i think about the people who started businesses in their dorm room. or people who started businesses in their garage.

* * *

it doesn't take long for quiet spaces to become loud spaces. quiet spaces. everyone needs them. i think this guy is from the walking advertisement industrial complex.

* * *

i have to look for something. i have to look for a position. not because i need the money, but because it's relevant to what i want to accomplish. but the only think i really want to accomplish is to have more money.

* * *

i liquidated nearly everything in my robinhood account. i don't think that i would have ever done that. really. i thought that i would just be able to hold down a job. but i actually can't. i can't hold down a job. everyone picks on me. and this is true no matter where i work.

i have to think about what my next moves are. because this is a nightmare. i don't know if i'll be able to find work. or what. or what kind of work or employment i should be looking for.

* * *

alright. well I guess that's over. what a total nightmare. but right now. i really don't know what to do for work.

* * *

it wasn't too far back that i really felt that things were getting better. but they continue to be a disaster. what the hell do i need to do.

* * *

These last few days have been extremely challenging for me. Everything feels like a kind of sensation overload, and I have to look for work, again.

* * *

This was written during my June Road trip


Well, since the relocation issue is settled, my figuring is that I might as well make a road trip out of my relocation back to Las Vegas.




...

I'm moving back in with my mother. I'm not going to hang out or set up in Tennessee, I'll probably reapply at UNLV when I get there, and find work.

...

I'm a coin laundry in Hohenwald, Tennessee, drying my clothes. I threw away 2 boxes of, I guess, just stuff, I'm continuing toward Nashville.

...

...

I have a little over an hour before I should be checking out of this motel, I really don't have any money right now for another day. On the one hand there's this idea that the easiest thing to do would be to head back to Texas, I wouldn't have to go through this whole relocation headache yet again. I dropped all of my classes at UTA, and this is bad, of course, but it might be forgivable. On the other hand, I have a feeling that there's some reason for all of this traveling and shit that I've been doing lately, I really should be leaving Texas, but where the hell do I go? This area is just fine for finding work and setting up my business, and it's a kind of low cost of living area, I think. The issue with staying here is that when I think about relocating, I start thinking that I can really relocate to pretty much anywhere. Or to put it another way, when I think about relocating, I could probably find something that's slightly more ideal than this particular place.

...

So what are my plans now? I wouldn't mind hanging out here in Somerville, but, I eventually have to go back to school. I have to be in a city where I can find work, transfer into a new college, somewhere that's somewhat inexpensive, and that I can set up my business. I'm somewhat skeptical that I'll be able to transfer to a new college, given that I basically didn't accomplish anything during my first semester at UTA. This was a fucking disaster.

I found it hard to get anything done. The reason I wanted to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource for the course was because the Bloomberg Market Concepts Certification course was part of the Student Managed Investment Fund's requirements. I found the Bloomberg Terminal kind of complex to use, at first, but once I got the hang of it, I found it extremely useful.

Most of the analytical crap you would do in Excel, or in some other is stuff you can do in the Bloomberg Terminal by pressing the correct button, or, if you have some other formula or algorithm that you're working with, you can just plug it into the Bloomberg Terminal. There seemed to be this obsession with exporting data from the Bloomberg Terminal to work with it in Excel or some other software program to do some kind of analytical shit, but, it just seemed like an unnecessary extra step.

Anyway, I dropped my classes, and I'll see about getting into a college, or transferring into a college somewhere in Tennessee. It's 3:56 AM and I'm really fucking hungry, luckily for me, nothing is fucking open. I'm thinking that, okay. so. I can't really head back to Texas for whatever various reasons that prevent me from heading back there. I can't go back, and that's that.

I'm trying to think about what the hell went wrong there. Well, I guess I owe a bunch of money and didn't even so much as finish my classes.

I don't completely remember what set me off on that First road trip in June, or the one in February, or any of these road trips. Maybe I was thinking about relocating. I don't remember. I think that I'm going to relocate this time, but what the hell am I going to do for work? How the hell do I get set up in a new town? I need to find work, and an apartment. I minute ago I was thinking about heading back to Texas, but I really can't head back to Texas.

I'm thinking.

Notes Taken During My First Semester at the University of Texas at Arlington

...

Annotation to Notes from Arlington # 65

This was written during my June Road trip. It's September 25th, 2022, and I'm back in Tennessee. 

...

i stayed in Somerville tn for a night. im in the next town over, and i already feel like just staying here.

...

today is sunday. my thinking is that the roads should be empty, and it would be a good idea to keep driving.

...

i cant really go back to texas anyway. but i dont really know where to go.

...

maybe it was just time to leave texas. i had been there for 2 years. maybe it was just time for me to go. i really don't know what to do about college though.

...

i think that im just going to relocate. 
i'm on the Arkansas side of Memphis. 
i honestly don't know where the hell to go.

Everywhere is a fucking nightmare.
the nightmare never ends.
I really can't go back to Texas.

I have to leave texas. I really do.
I don't really know where to go, though.
this was a fabulous waste of money.

I threw away as much of my stuff as I could.
and threw away additional stuff on my way here.

I'll probably throw away 
additional stuff here 
and there
on my way to where 
ever the hell I end up.

i don't really know where 
the fuck to go at
this point.

I'm facing one frustration after another.

...

I'm really having a hard time getting my business in a more formalized state. I have the various things that I need to do on my calendar, but, sometimes there is no telling if I will get anything done or not, or if I'll get distracted by this or that issue, or, you know, who knows what will happen. I'm still facing a number of different challenges. and stuff. You know, like this and that stuff.

...

Class Notes Starting September 14th, 2022

one thing that I often face that impedes my ability to get anything done is the avalanche of emails that I have to deal with, or that fall into my mail box. I obviously don't read them all, but I usually scan them to see if they contain anything important.

...

Thinking. I'm going to hold off on looking for work right now. or looking for an internship or anything like that.

I really should just be focusing on school right now.


...

what else is on my mind? Just facing quite a few challenges lately. It seems as though everywhere I go, someone or another tries to instigate a reaction. and it isn't always clear to me why.

...

June
July 
and 
August

were kind of a blur

same for the first part of September. I think that I went on four road trips this year. really long fucking road trips.

Notes from Arlington, Texas # 68

I better not buy anything that I don't need. I thought about buying a few wallets online, but I'm going to hold off on that for now.

Annotation to Notes from Arlington, Texas # 68

I really spent way too much money during these last few months. I really need to make my best effort to stay in school, otherwise I'm more or less fucked.

and again.

I really don't know how I'll be able to balance working and going to college at the same time. This might be a pain in the neck, but I also might be able to make this happen. Who knows.

...

















...

Note: This is kind of a running page of notes.

...

I really don't want to wear hats anymore. I feel like they give me a headache. One thing I realize from being in Texas for several years now, is that, it's hot, and humid, and it's really easy to get sweaty and smelly.

...

I would like to think up a new series title, but I really can't come up with anything. I really can't think of anything.

...

This is where the orange juice 
sends the lemonade to the martini. 
this is where the mimosa and the 
mojito drink and eat and feel 
the ends of the earth.

...

okay, so here is the issue. currently. i might be able to get some work done, but i'm not entirely sure about that. it's fifty-fifty.

...

Note: This is kind of a running page of notes.

...

it can be kind of difficult to get anything done around here. a total fucking nightmare. I doubt that any of us can really get anything done.


it's kind of such a nightmare. to get anything done/ it can

Placeholder, still h

...

im not an indolent moron, nor am i an insolent ingrate. im tired. thats it. i guess it's a smoking room.

i ended up smoking in the room anyway. dont worry. i didnt have any fucking food. so i ate the nearest thing available. 

anyway. i know it took me a while to return to dallas, but, i figured that time was not of the essence, since compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe.

however. i have to figure something out. i cant find my fucking calculator. i havent upgraded since 1989. i dont even know if i still have that thing. shit.

...

always. if i visit Kentucky. i invariably manage to take the route back to dallas that passes through nashville. or vice versa, like last month.

...

This is the Third Time, September 3rd, 2022

anyway.

kenneth larot yamat is currently subject to a nondisclosure agreement with an undisclosed party.

should any specific remarks be made about his complete inability to perform cunnilingus from monday 7:02 AM to monday 7:77 AM be discussed with anyone other than the appropriate parties invloved, he will be in violation of said non-disclosure agreement, the breach of which will require significant compensation in the form of additional specific performance of additional cunnilingus or additional performance based compensation in the form of substantially more intense cunnilingus for the remainder of the current artistic performance of completely unsatisfactory cunnilingus, requiring an additional cunnilingus session performed with all deliberate haste.

should he smell like anything other than pussy juice upon his return to his current residence, he will be subject to nothing less than multiple additional performances of additional cunnilingus. 

...

some young man made a defamatory remark a while ago. young. but thats the way it goes for kids his age. well. he left. so.

well. any chance he could. you know. he is.

...

i dont know whats up. but. i think someone out there is accomplishment blocking me. i tried to head back to texas so that i could attend class in person, however, as soon as i left indiana, there was a fucking monsoon, or fucking invasion from outer space consisting primarily of rain drops, which kept falling on my head. so i put on my hat.

i dont feel like drowning to death. right now. i asked the sheriff for directions, he said theres a hotel in the big city. i got there. and there was no hotel. i guess i should have asked the deputy, but either he didnt have a deputy, or the deputy was in invisible mode. so.

...

When I think about. I don't know what to say.

this is the third road trip in 3 months. i'm tired. and. im just so irritable.

i want to be nice, but, sometimes i end up in places i dont really want to be.

i really don't want to withdraw from school. i think that the discipline i'm pursuing is an important one.

i just don't know why i face the challenges that i face.

but this third road trip. really. even though it has been a nightmare, i don't think that the outcome will be as terrible as.

i just don't know what to say.

i really want to finish the program. im heading all the way back to texas. again.







...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

but the .prn file that i was trying to open earlier was probably from a spreadsheet that was exported from someone's pocket calculator, and then uploaded to where i can download it.


...







 
...

 





...










...

today is tuesday. what did i get done today?

so. i think i figured something out to the internship / work search issue.

i'm going to use the bloomberg terminal.

anyway.

that's exactly what i tried to do this morning. 

i figured that. since today is tuesday. i can work on something other than coursework.

so i worked on the work search.

i didn't know where to start,
but

only in the sense that i didn't know
where
i wanted to start.

so i just started exploring the tabs.

anyway. a lot of the companies that i'm interested in don't really have any openings. many don't even have a career page.

so.

i just mailed out a bunch of hand written letters.

the first company I called up. i mentioned that they were listed on the campus job board, but when i went to their website, they didn't even have a career page.

the person who answered the phone mentioned that they didn't have any openings, and they rarely have open positions.

so i figured i'd mail them a letter, saying that i'm interested in working for their company one day.

...

what's on my mind right now? Tuesday. tomorrow is tuesday.

...

it was kind of tedious, but I did it. i really have to figure out how to put this into words. but I went ticker by ticker. i mean. it didn't take a hell of a lot of time, but it really was tedious. really tedious.

...

There was one silly issue that I had because, I don't know what this would be refered to in the spreadsheet application that I typically use, but:

It's Called Freeze Panes / Freeze Rows.

Silly.

...

So here is one thing. I need to use two sources, I need to use Bloomberg for the Expected Returns, and I need to use State Street for the weights within the index.

see screenshot below.

I'm trying to highlight how I'm using the information from both sources, Bloomberg and State Street.

...





...

Below is a screenshot of the "custom" tab for the watchlist analytics function, and I'm wanting to put in a formula, but I don't know how to format formulas for the Bloomberg Terminal.

the issue is i want to be able to do Excel Stuff without opening Excel.

...











...

okay. so there are more screenshots here than i can really discuss.

i'm looking at the watchlist analytics for S5INDU and S5MATR in the Bloomberg terminal.

There is one thing that I'm interested in. and it's the tap at the far right that says "Custom"

I tried working with it, but, I haven't come up with anything.
...

 






...


i think that i figured something out.

...

















...


S5INDU is the ticker of the industrials index - XLI is the ETF that tracks the materials index
S5MATR is the ticker of the materials index - XLB is the ETF that tracks the materials index


...

so what was it?

it was odd. 

the sectors i intended on focusing on was materials.

how it works in this class is that industrials and materials are grouped together for the purposes of group assignments.

i remember when sectors were being assigned, the person who is my current group partner called out industrials, and i called out materials.

so i was under the impression that my group partner would want to work the industrials sector.

but when we spoke today, my group partner mentioned wanting to focus on materials.

but when we had minor group work together, my group partner went into the industrial set first, and then the materials set next.

this isn't a problem. really. but, i just don't know. if this is going to continue to oscillate back and forth or what.

what i'm thinking is. it really might not matter, the reason being that even though i might like materials, if.

well

it just shouldn't matter if i look at industrials or materials.

...

so what happened the other night? well, i was at the library later, I think about 45 minutes after midnight, I wanted to get a bunch of stuff done, but, I was tired, and there seem to be as many distractions during the night as there are during the day.

anyway. I want to continue working on my paper.

so in the example student paper, correlations are drawn between the index performance of the financials index, as well as the performance of the real estate index.

what what should I look at in my case?

what I'm thinking about is looking at the various correlations between the materials sector and various commodities.

so in the screenshot below i'm looking at the historical beta for the materials index and the

i think this is brent crude?

let me look.

okay, so it's WTI crude, but what does that mean?

...

















...

now what the hell was i thinking about? I think that i'm somewhat tired, and i'll come back to this later. it's just usually so crowded around here that I really can't get anything done, and I think that it's more or less the same issue.

...

well, i think that i've found something that I can amuse myself with whenever i think that i'm becoming distracted.

...

but it's basically this. I have an idea, and it is an amazing idea, and I think that most people will be impressed by it, if it can be executed in a way that people find interesting, and I think that most people will find it interesting because even when I just think about it, I'm intersted in it myself, and you think that most people will be interested in it, but, they probably won't be interested in it because it is such a trivial thing to pursue.

here is what I think about most things.

...

I can't figure out what the hell I was working on earlier, but I have found something that I'm interested in. I really have, and I think that I want to explore more of what I'm doing with this. and this should be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to the universe, and people all around the universe will be amazed with what I'm about to produce, and I will be quoted the universe over, by other sentient life forms, and even non-living forms of sentience, 

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

I'm going to look at the components in the materials sector of the  S&P 1500 index.

...

Well. truth is. I'm not sure where I was going to go with bond yields for the materials sector, I think what I wanted to do was to check into.

I guess somehow figure how sensitive the materials sector is to interest rates. I could probably use the other chart to figure out a correlation between the two.

like um. ten year treasuries and xlb.

but i'm sure that. um. 

i really want something more accurate.

I want to figure out what each company is actually paying in terms of interest coupon payments and how this interacts.

but i'm going to forget about this for now and look at something else. but what was it though? for whatever reason I can't recall what the hell I was thinking about.

...

I wanted to look at something, but I'm not sure where I'm going with this. What I think I was trying to look up, was.

I wanted to search. something like bonds. or. i wanted to see how the bond yields compare for companies listed in the materials sector, and compare these to dividend yields for the same companies, but here is the thing.

I'm not sure if this would really mean anything. I'm 

I guess. I'm currently under the assumption. that the bond yields should be comparable to the dividend yields, but I'm not sure why I'm assuming this. I guess, I'm not sure what makes me think that the bond yields should be comparable, so I'm not sure why I would want to figure out if the information in the Bloomberg terminal would either confirm my assumption or suspicion or hypothesis or what.

there are other things that I kind of want to look into here as well.

...

anyway. I think that this is as much note taking as I'm going to do for the day, and then I'm going to head home.

...

So I think this is the 5 year Volatility and Risk analysis, and the citation for this screenshot should be styled as:

S5MATR Index Historical Beta 5 YR, via Bloomberg LP, Accessed August 28, 2022

Notes:

Historical Beta

and 

Regression Analysis

are the same thing.

I think, unless I'm missing something.

What I mean is, it seems that when a person is trying to determine the historical beta of an index, or some other security against a benchmark

it's the same thing as performing a regression analysis of an index or some other security against a benchmark,

and it's possible that I already learned this at some point in the past

or maybe someone already told me this before, or maybe I came across this somewhere or another.

anyway.

the reason I'm fussing over this mentally is that the other day I said something like:



"So I would basically pay twice as much for the full set, right?"

and then the guy said

"No, you would just pay double for all four over the quoted price of just two."

and this is always annoying because, it's possible that two people are saying the same thing using different words, but there is always one person in any conversation who really doesn't understand that the same thing can be said in multiple ways. 


...

















...

I figured out how to put all four of the things I'm looking at into a single chart, the only thing is, is that it isn't very interesting to look at.

SPX Index Comparative Returns, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP Accessed August 28, 2022 

so the part of the assignment that I'm trying to work on has me look at: 

Price Performance, Total Return Analysis, Volatility and Risk Analysis, and Those are for YTD and 3YR Periods

and Positive Alpha over a 5 year period.
...

















...

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

XLB US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPY US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022



...



















...

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

the issue here is that I need to put the total return for both indices into a single graph, and not have 2 separate graphs, but I forgot how to do that.

anyway, as far as citation styling goes, I think that I would style the first as:

S5MATR Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...



















...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of: 

(Bloomberg, 2022)

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

one is that I want to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource, and if possible, the only resource,

and

I want to keep whatever graphics and images and charts that I use in the paper and class presentation to be screenshots and screen captures from the Bloomberg Terminal,

the other thing that I want to mention is that when i'm searching the materials sector, I'm alternating the columns between the GICS and BICS classification systems.


...





...

It really annoys me when the weather is hot and windy, because I want to keep the window open when it's hot, but the shades won't stop moving when it's windy and the window is open. I'm thinking about Sunday, and what to do on Sunday. I didn't apply for any internships or positions since I last wrote about wanting to find one. There's this endless competition between my desire to work on things of personal interest and things of professional interest, and educational pursuits are kind of a combination of both, or maybe educational pursuits are at the intersection of personal interests and professional interests. 

...

One thing about putting notes on my blog from sources around the internet is that I think it might make more sense to take screenshots of what I find, rather than copying and pasting the material because I file copyrights on the text from my blog, and I obviously can't file a copyright claim for text that I didn't write myself, so to prevent me from accidentally filing a copyright claim on someone else's content, I'll just make a reference to other people's content using screenshots, rather than copying and pasting the text.

There is also this other issue with inserting images into my blog. The issue involves where the lines break, and I guess I just figured out what happens. so I guess I answered the question to the issue that I was having. so there.

...





...
...

The sector analysis paper is due before the Bloomberg Certification is due, so, I guess I'll get started on that first.
...

 i went out to eat. i was on campus for
several hours doing course work. what else?
I think that I'm going to work on something.


when I got home after going out to eat. and

lines between newer content and older content
and i'm not sure how this will look or how it will
appear. but i guess i'll see.


nah. you know what. now that i think about it. i do
have to create marks that separate one train of
thought from another train of thought and kind
of demarcate where one train of though begins
and where one ends. so


never mind.
well. i kind of want to head back to campus to
get some work done at the library. i think that today
i spent about 3 hours in the lab. i went to lunch at


11 AM, arrived at campus around 1 PM and left
at around 4 PM. or a little after.


there is an event at the stadium and it's packed and loud
and noisy and i think that i'll wait it out for now. i did
get an email from the student newspaper, and it had
an article or an advertisement of an information
section about student housing options that are on
campus, and i think that i'll explore those at some
point.

Back Home, September 9th, 2022

i dont know what happened the other day. but i seemed to have irritated the bartender at this pizza place i went to. i really didn't understand what happened.

she seemed upset about something. she said that she wanted me to leave. so i paid and left.

a guy chased after me, and said: "No one here thinks that's funny."

and i still have no idea what i did, or what offense i committed.

i remember, i asked where the basil was, and a woman behind me said:

"the toppings are placed underneath the cheese here."

and i responded: "you're right about that, i've eaten here before."

and then i just sort of went at it with my pizza,

and then the bartender became upset.

my nails were dirty, really dirty, and i was eating two slices of pizza at a time. like a pig.

and maybe that was the thing, she was irritated that i was eating like a pig.

but.

i think that i was eating with a fork and knife first, and then
i started eating with my hands.

maybe i should just change my major or something.

i really fucking wanted to go to school, but, i don't really know what the hell to do.

Notes, Thoughts, and Reflections While Using the Bloomberg Terminal 





...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

but the .prn file that i was trying to open earlier was probably from a spreadsheet that was exported from someone's pocket calculator, and then uploaded to where i can download it.


...

...










...

today is tuesday. what did i get done today?

so. i think i figured something out to the internship / work search issue.

i'm going to use the bloomberg terminal.

anyway.

that's exactly what i tried to do this morning. 

i figured that. since today is tuesday. i can work on something other than coursework.

so i worked on the work search.

i didn't know where to start,
but

only in the sense that i didn't know
where
i wanted to start.

so i just started exploring the tabs.

anyway. a lot of the companies that i'm interested in don't really have any openings. many don't even have a career page.

so.

i just mailed out a bunch of hand written letters.

the first company I called up. i mentioned that they were listed on the campus job board, but when i went to their website, they didn't even have a career page.

the person who answered the phone mentioned that they didn't have any openings, and they rarely have open positions.

so i figured i'd mail them a letter, saying that i'm interested in working for their company one day.

...

what's on my mind right now? Tuesday. tomorrow is tuesday.

...

it was kind of tedious, but I did it. i really have to figure out how to put this into words. but I went ticker by ticker. i mean. it didn't take a hell of a lot of time, but it really was tedious. really tedious.

...

There was one silly issue that I had because, I don't know what this would be refered to in the spreadsheet application that I typically use, but:

It's Called Freeze Panes / Freeze Rows.

Silly.

...

So here is one thing. I need to use two sources, I need to use Bloomberg for the Expected Returns, and I need to use State Street for the weights within the index.

see screenshot below.

I'm trying to highlight how I'm using the information from both sources, Bloomberg and State Street.

...





...

Below is a screenshot of the "custom" tab for the watchlist analytics function, and I'm wanting to put in a formula, but I don't know how to format formulas for the Bloomberg Terminal.

the issue is i want to be able to do Excel Stuff without opening Excel.

...











...

okay. so there are more screenshots here than i can really discuss.

i'm looking at the watchlist analytics for S5INDU and S5MATR in the Bloomberg terminal.

There is one thing that I'm interested in. and it's the tap at the far right that says "Custom"

I tried working with it, but, I haven't come up with anything.
...

 






...


i think that i figured something out.

...

















...


S5INDU is the ticker of the industrials index - XLI is the ETF that tracks the materials index
S5MATR is the ticker of the materials index - XLB is the ETF that tracks the materials index


...

so what was it?

it was odd. 

the sectors i intended on focusing on was materials.

how it works in this class is that industrials and materials are grouped together for the purposes of group assignments.

i remember when sectors were being assigned, the person who is my current group partner called out industrials, and i called out materials.

so i was under the impression that my group partner would want to work the industrials sector.

but when we spoke today, my group partner mentioned wanting to focus on materials.

but when we had minor group work together, my group partner went into the industrial set first, and then the materials set next.

this isn't a problem. really. but, i just don't know. if this is going to continue to oscillate back and forth or what.

what i'm thinking is. it really might not matter, the reason being that even though i might like materials, if.

well

it just shouldn't matter if i look at industrials or materials.

...

so what happened the other night? well, i was at the library later, I think about 45 minutes after midnight, I wanted to get a bunch of stuff done, but, I was tired, and there seem to be as many distractions during the night as there are during the day.

anyway. I want to continue working on my paper.

so in the example student paper, correlations are drawn between the index performance of the financials index, as well as the performance of the real estate index.

what what should I look at in my case?

what I'm thinking about is looking at the various correlations between the materials sector and various commodities.

so in the screenshot below i'm looking at the historical beta for the materials index and the

i think this is brent crude?

let me look.

okay, so it's WTI crude, but what does that mean?

...

















...

now what the hell was i thinking about? I think that i'm somewhat tired, and i'll come back to this later. it's just usually so crowded around here that I really can't get anything done, and I think that it's more or less the same issue.

...

well, i think that i've found something that I can amuse myself with whenever i think that i'm becoming distracted.

...

but it's basically this. I have an idea, and it is an amazing idea, and I think that most people will be impressed by it, if it can be executed in a way that people find interesting, and I think that most people will find it interesting because even when I just think about it, I'm intersted in it myself, and you think that most people will be interested in it, but, they probably won't be interested in it because it is such a trivial thing to pursue.

here is what I think about most things.

...

I can't figure out what the hell I was working on earlier, but I have found something that I'm interested in. I really have, and I think that I want to explore more of what I'm doing with this. and this should be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to the universe, and people all around the universe will be amazed with what I'm about to produce, and I will be quoted the universe over, by other sentient life forms, and even non-living forms of sentience, 

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

I'm going to look at the components in the materials sector of the  S&P 1500 index.

...

Well. truth is. I'm not sure where I was going to go with bond yields for the materials sector, I think what I wanted to do was to check into.

I guess somehow figure how sensitive the materials sector is to interest rates. I could probably use the other chart to figure out a correlation between the two.

like um. ten year treasuries and xlb.

but i'm sure that. um. 

i really want something more accurate.

I want to figure out what each company is actually paying in terms of interest coupon payments and how this interacts.

but i'm going to forget about this for now and look at something else. but what was it though? for whatever reason I can't recall what the hell I was thinking about.

...

I wanted to look at something, but I'm not sure where I'm going with this. What I think I was trying to look up, was.

I wanted to search. something like bonds. or. i wanted to see how the bond yields compare for companies listed in the materials sector, and compare these to dividend yields for the same companies, but here is the thing.

I'm not sure if this would really mean anything. I'm 

I guess. I'm currently under the assumption. that the bond yields should be comparable to the dividend yields, but I'm not sure why I'm assuming this. I guess, I'm not sure what makes me think that the bond yields should be comparable, so I'm not sure why I would want to figure out if the information in the Bloomberg terminal would either confirm my assumption or suspicion or hypothesis or what.

there are other things that I kind of want to look into here as well.

...

anyway. I think that this is as much note taking as I'm going to do for the day, and then I'm going to head home.

...

So I think this is the 5 year Volatility and Risk analysis, and the citation for this screenshot should be styled as:

S5MATR Index Historical Beta 5 YR, via Bloomberg LP, Accessed August 28, 2022

Notes:

Historical Beta

and 

Regression Analysis

are the same thing.

I think, unless I'm missing something.

What I mean is, it seems that when a person is trying to determine the historical beta of an index, or some other security against a benchmark

it's the same thing as performing a regression analysis of an index or some other security against a benchmark,

and it's possible that I already learned this at some point in the past

or maybe someone already told me this before, or maybe I came across this somewhere or another.

anyway.

the reason I'm fussing over this mentally is that the other day I said something like:



"So I would basically pay twice as much for the full set, right?"

and then the guy said

"No, you would just pay double for all four over the quoted price of just two."

and this is always annoying because, it's possible that two people are saying the same thing using different words, but there is always one person in any conversation who really doesn't understand that the same thing can be said in multiple ways. 


...

















...

I figured out how to put all four of the things I'm looking at into a single chart, the only thing is, is that it isn't very interesting to look at.

SPX Index Comparative Returns, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP Accessed August 28, 2022 

so the part of the assignment that I'm trying to work on has me look at: 

Price Performance, Total Return Analysis, Volatility and Risk Analysis, and Those are for YTD and 3YR Periods

and Positive Alpha over a 5 year period.
...

















...

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

XLB US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPY US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022



...



















...

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

the issue here is that I need to put the total return for both indices into a single graph, and not have 2 separate graphs, but I forgot how to do that.

anyway, as far as citation styling goes, I think that I would style the first as:

S5MATR Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...



















...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of: 

(Bloomberg, 2022)

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

one is that I want to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource, and if possible, the only resource,

and

I want to keep whatever graphics and images and charts that I use in the paper and class presentation to be screenshots and screen captures from the Bloomberg Terminal,

the other thing that I want to mention is that when i'm searching the materials sector, I'm alternating the columns between the GICS and BICS classification systems.


...





...

It really annoys me when the weather is hot and windy, because I want to keep the window open when it's hot, but the shades won't stop moving when it's windy and the window is open. I'm thinking about Sunday, and what to do on Sunday. I didn't apply for any internships or positions since I last wrote about wanting to find one. There's this endless competition between my desire to work on things of personal interest and things of professional interest, and educational pursuits are kind of a combination of both, or maybe educational pursuits are at the intersection of personal interests and professional interests. 

...

One thing about putting notes on my blog from sources around the internet is that I think it might make more sense to take screenshots of what I find, rather than copying and pasting the material because I file copyrights on the text from my blog, and I obviously can't file a copyright claim for text that I didn't write myself, so to prevent me from accidentally filing a copyright claim on someone else's content, I'll just make a reference to other people's content using screenshots, rather than copying and pasting the text.

There is also this other issue with inserting images into my blog. The issue involves where the lines break, and I guess I just figured out what happens. so I guess I answered the question to the issue that I was having. so there.

...





...
...

The sector analysis paper is due before the Bloomberg Certification is due, so, I guess I'll get started on that first.
...


...

 i went out to eat. i was on campus for
several hours doing course work. what else?
I think that I'm going to work on something.


when I got home after going out to eat. and
spending time on campus. and then going
out to eat again, i um. had trouble turning
on my laptop and i was really frustrated
about it. but i eventually got it turned out.




...


I'm tired. and hungry.
it's 330 am.
what could i eat?


...

I submitted a copyright claim for the previous post
and I'm thinking that for this post I'll just make it
one big
well
what i'm thinking is that i'll take a different
approach to how i format this post and
i think that i'm going to skip out on creating


lines between newer content and older content
and i'm not sure how this will look or how it will
appear. but i guess i'll see.


nah. you know what. now that i think about it. i do
have to create marks that separate one train of
thought from another train of thought and kind
of demarcate where one train of though begins
and where one ends. so


never mind.
well. i kind of want to head back to campus to
get some work done at the library. i think that today
i spent about 3 hours in the lab. i went to lunch at


11 AM, arrived at campus around 1 PM and left
at around 4 PM. or a little after.


there is an event at the stadium and it's packed and loud
and noisy and i think that i'll wait it out for now. i did
get an email from the student newspaper, and it had
an article or an advertisement of an information
section about student housing options that are on
campus, and i think that i'll explore those at some
point.

Class Notes Starting September 14th, 2022

one thing that I often face that impedes my ability to get anything done is the avalanche of emails that I have to deal with, or that fall into my mail box. I obviously don't read them all, but I usually scan them to see if they contain anything important.

...

Thinking. I'm going to hold off on looking for work right now. or looking for an internship or anything like that.

I really should just be focusing on school right now.


...

what else is on my mind? Just facing quite a few challenges lately. It seems as though everywhere I go, someone or another tries to instigate a reaction. and it isn't always clear to me why.

...

June
July 
and 
August

were kind of a blur

same for the first part of September. I think that I went on four road trips this year. really long fucking road trips.



...

















...

Note: This is kind of a running page of notes.

...

I really don't want to wear hats anymore. I feel like they give me a headache. One thing I realize from being in Texas for several years now, is that, it's hot, and humid, and it's really easy to get sweaty and smelly.

...

I would like to think up a new series title, but I really can't come up with anything. I really can't think of anything.

...

This is where the orange juice 
sends the lemonade to the martini. 
this is where the mimosa and the 
mojito drink and eat and feel 
the ends of the earth.

...

okay, so here is the issue. currently. i might be able to get some work done, but i'm not entirely sure about that. it's fifty-fifty.

...

Note: This is kind of a running page of notes.

...

it can be kind of difficult to get anything done around here. a total fucking nightmare. I doubt that any of us can really get anything done.


it's kind of such a nightmare. to get anything done/ it can

...

im not an indolent moron, nor am i an insolent ingrate. im tired. thats it. i guess it's a smoking room.

i ended up smoking in the room anyway. dont worry. i didnt have any fucking food. so i ate the nearest thing available. 

anyway. i know it took me a while to return to dallas, but, i figured that time was not of the essence, since compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe.

however. i have to figure something out. i cant find my fucking calculator. i havent upgraded since 1989. i dont even know if i still have that thing. shit.

...

always. if i visit Kentucky. i invariably manage to take the route back to dallas that passes through nashville. or vice versa, like last month.

...

This is the Third Time, September 3rd, 2022

anyway.

kenneth larot yamat is currently subject to a nondisclosure agreement with an undisclosed party.

should any specific remarks be made about his complete inability to perform cunnilingus from monday 7:02 AM to monday 7:77 AM be discussed with anyone other than the appropriate parties invloved, he will be in violation of said non-disclosure agreement, the breach of which will require significant compensation in the form of additional specific performance of additional cunnilingus or additional performance based compensation in the form of substantially more intense cunnilingus for the remainder of the current artistic performance of completely unsatisfactory cunnilingus, requiring an additional cunnilingus session performed with all deliberate haste.

should he smell like anything other than pussy juice upon his return to his current residence, he will be subject to nothing less than multiple additional performances of additional cunnilingus. 

...

some young man made a defamatory remark a while ago. young. but thats the way it goes for kids his age. well. he left. so.

well. any chance he could. you know. he is.

...

i dont know whats up. but. i think someone out there is accomplishment blocking me. i tried to head back to texas so that i could attend class in person, however, as soon as i left indiana, there was a fucking monsoon, or fucking invasion from outer space consisting primarily of rain drops, which kept falling on my head. so i put on my hat.

i dont feel like drowning to death. right now. i asked the sheriff for directions, he said theres a hotel in the big city. i got there. and there was no hotel. i guess i should have asked the deputy, but either he didnt have a deputy, or the deputy was in invisible mode. so.

...

When I think about. I don't know what to say.

this is the third road trip in 3 months. i'm tired. and. im just so irritable.

i want to be nice, but, sometimes i end up in places i dont really want to be.

i really don't want to withdraw from school. i think that the discipline i'm pursuing is an important one.

i just don't know why i face the challenges that i face.

but this third road trip. really. even though it has been a nightmare, i don't think that the outcome will be as terrible as.

i just don't know what to say.

i really want to finish the program. im heading all the way back to texas. again.







...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

I really have, and I think that I want to explore more of what I'm doing with this. and this should be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to the universe, and people all around the universe will be amazed with what I'm about to produce, and I will be quoted the universe over, by other sentient life forms, and even non-living forms of sentience, 

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

I'm going to look at the components in the materials sector of the  S&P 1500 index.

...

Well. truth is. I'm not sure where I was going to go with bond yields for the materials sector, I think what I wanted to do was to check into.

I guess somehow figure how sensitive the materials sector is to interest rates. I could probably use the other chart to figure out a correlation between the two.

like um. ten year treasuries and xlb.

but i'm sure that. um. 

i really want something more accurate.

I want to figure out what each company is actually paying in terms of interest coupon payments and how this interacts.

but i'm going to forget about this for now and look at something else. but what was it though? for whatever reason I can't recall what the hell I was thinking about.

...

I wanted to look at something, but I'm not sure where I'm going with this. What I think I was trying to look up, was.

I wanted to search. something like bonds. or. i wanted to see how the bond yields compare for companies listed in the materials sector, and compare these to dividend yields for the same companies, but here is the thing.

I'm not sure if this would really mean anything. I'm 

I guess. I'm currently under the assumption. that the bond yields should be comparable to the dividend yields, but I'm not sure why I'm assuming this. I guess, I'm not sure what makes me think that the bond yields should be comparable, so I'm not sure why I would want to figure out if the information in the Bloomberg terminal would either confirm my assumption or suspicion or hypothesis or what.

there are other things that I kind of want to look into here as well.

...

anyway. I think that this is as much note taking as I'm going to do for the day, and then I'm going to head home.

...

So I think this is the 5 year Volatility and Risk analysis, and the citation for this screenshot should be styled as:

S5MATR Index Historical Beta 5 YR, via Bloomberg LP, Accessed August 28, 2022

Notes:

Historical Beta

and 

Regression Analysis

are the same thing.

I think, unless I'm missing something.

What I mean is, it seems that when a person is trying to determine the historical beta of an index, or some other security against a benchmark

it's the same thing as performing a regression analysis of an index or some other security against a benchmark,

and it's possible that I already learned this at some point in the past

or maybe someone already told me this before, or maybe I came across this somewhere or another.

anyway.

the reason I'm fussing over this mentally is that the other day I said something like:



"So I would basically pay twice as much for the full set, right?"

and then the guy said

"No, you would just pay double for all four over the quoted price of just two."

and this is always annoying because, it's possible that two people are saying the same thing using different words, but there is always one person in any conversation who really doesn't understand that the same thing can be said in multiple ways. 


...

















...

I figured out how to put all four of the things I'm looking at into a single chart, the only thing is, is that it isn't very interesting to look at.

SPX Index Comparative Returns, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP Accessed August 28, 2022 

so the part of the assignment that I'm trying to work on has me look at: 

Price Performance, Total Return Analysis, Volatility and Risk Analysis, and Those are for YTD and 3YR Periods

and Positive Alpha over a 5 year period.
...

















...

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

XLB US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPY US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022



...



















...

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

the issue here is that I need to put the total return for both indices into a single graph, and not have 2 separate graphs, but I forgot how to do that.

anyway, as far as citation styling goes, I think that I would style the first as:

S5MATR Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...



















...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of: 

(Bloomberg, 2022)

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

one is that I want to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource, and if possible, the only resource,

and

I want to keep whatever graphics and images and charts that I use in the paper and class presentation to be screenshots and screen captures from the Bloomberg Terminal,

the other thing that I want to mention is that when i'm searching the materials sector, I'm alternating the columns between the GICS and BICS classification systems.


...





...

It really annoys me when the weather is hot and windy, because I want to keep the window open when it's hot, but the shades won't stop moving when it's windy and the window is open. I'm thinking about Sunday, and what to do on Sunday. I didn't apply for any internships or positions since I last wrote about wanting to find one. There's this endless competition between my desire to work on things of personal interest and things of professional interest, and educational pursuits are kind of a combination of both, or maybe educational pursuits are at the intersection of personal interests and professional interests. 

...

One thing about putting notes on my blog from sources around the internet is that I think it might make more sense to take screenshots of what I find, rather than copying and pasting the material because I file copyrights on the text from my blog, and I obviously can't file a copyright claim for text that I didn't write myself, so to prevent me from accidentally filing a copyright claim on someone else's content, I'll just make a reference to other people's content using screenshots, rather than copying and pasting the text.

There is also this other issue with inserting images into my blog. The issue involves where the lines break, and I guess I just figured out what happens. so I guess I answered the question to the issue that I was having. so there.

...





...
...

The sector analysis paper is due before the Bloomberg Certification is due, so, I guess I'll get started on that first.
...


...

 i went out to eat. i was on campus for
several hours doing course work. what else?
I think that I'm going to work on something.


when I got home after going out to eat. and
spending time on campus. and then going
out to eat again, i um. had trouble turning
on my laptop and i was really frustrated
about it. but i eventually got it turned out.




...


I'm tired. and hungry.
it's 330 am.
what could i eat?


...

I submitted a copyright claim for the previous post
and I'm thinking that for this post I'll just make it
one big
well
what i'm thinking is that i'll take a different
approach to how i format this post and
i think that i'm going to skip out on creating


lines between newer content and older content
and i'm not sure how this will look or how it will
appear. but i guess i'll see.


nah. you know what. now that i think about it. i do
have to create marks that separate one train of
thought from another train of thought and kind
of demarcate where one train of though begins
and where one ends. so


never mind.
well. i kind of want to head back to campus to
get some work done at the library. i think that today
i spent about 3 hours in the lab. i went to lunch at


11 AM, arrived at campus around 1 PM and left
at around 4 PM. or a little after.


there is an event at the stadium and it's packed and loud
and noisy and i think that i'll wait it out for now. i did
get an email from the student newspaper, and it had
an article or an advertisement of an information
section about student housing options that are on
campus, and i think that i'll explore those at some
point.

Back Home, September 9th, 2022

i dont know what happened the other day. but i seemed to have irritated the bartender at this pizza place i went to. i really didn't understand what happened.

she seemed upset about something. she said that she wanted me to leave. so i paid and left.

a guy chased after me, and said: "No one here thinks that's funny."

and i still have no idea what i did, or what offense i committed.

i remember, i asked where the basil was, and a woman behind me said:

"the toppings are placed underneath the cheese here."

and i responded: "you're right about that, i've eaten here before."

and then i just sort of went at it with my pizza,

and then the bartender became upset.

my nails were dirty, really dirty, and i was eating two slices of pizza at a time. like a pig.

and maybe that was the thing, she was irritated that i was eating like a pig.

but.

i think that i was eating with a fork and knife first, and then
i started eating with my hands.

maybe i should just change my major or something.

i really fucking wanted to go to school, but, i don't really know what the hell to do.

...

Notes, Thoughts, and Reflections While Using the Bloomberg Terminal 





...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

but the .prn file that i was trying to open earlier was probably from a spreadsheet that was exported from someone's pocket calculator, and then uploaded to where i can download it.


...







 
...

 





...










...

today is tuesday. what did i get done today?

so. i think i figured something out to the internship / work search issue.

i'm going to use the bloomberg terminal.

anyway.

that's exactly what i tried to do this morning. 

i figured that. since today is tuesday. i can work on something other than coursework.

so i worked on the work search.

i didn't know where to start,
but

only in the sense that i didn't know
where
i wanted to start.

so i just started exploring the tabs.

anyway. a lot of the companies that i'm interested in don't really have any openings. many don't even have a career page.

so.

i just mailed out a bunch of hand written letters.

the first company I called up. i mentioned that they were listed on the campus job board, but when i went to their website, they didn't even have a career page.

the person who answered the phone mentioned that they didn't have any openings, and they rarely have open positions.

so i figured i'd mail them a letter, saying that i'm interested in working for their company one day.

...

what's on my mind right now? Tuesday. tomorrow is tuesday.

...

it was kind of tedious, but I did it. i really have to figure out how to put this into words. but I went ticker by ticker. i mean. it didn't take a hell of a lot of time, but it really was tedious. really tedious.

...

There was one silly issue that I had because, I don't know what this would be refered to in the spreadsheet application that I typically use, but:

It's Called Freeze Panes / Freeze Rows.

Silly.

...

So here is one thing. I need to use two sources, I need to use Bloomberg for the Expected Returns, and I need to use State Street for the weights within the index.

see screenshot below.

I'm trying to highlight how I'm using the information from both sources, Bloomberg and State Street.

...





...

Below is a screenshot of the "custom" tab for the watchlist analytics function, and I'm wanting to put in a formula, but I don't know how to format formulas for the Bloomberg Terminal.

the issue is i want to be able to do Excel Stuff without opening Excel.

...











...

okay. so there are more screenshots here than i can really discuss.

i'm looking at the watchlist analytics for S5INDU and S5MATR in the Bloomberg terminal.

There is one thing that I'm interested in. and it's the tap at the far right that says "Custom"

I tried working with it, but, I haven't come up with anything.
...

 






...


i think that i figured something out.

...

















...


S5INDU is the ticker of the industrials index - XLI is the ETF that tracks the materials index
S5MATR is the ticker of the materials index - XLB is the ETF that tracks the materials index


...

so what was it?

it was odd. 

the sectors i intended on focusing on was materials.

how it works in this class is that industrials and materials are grouped together for the purposes of group assignments.

i remember when sectors were being assigned, the person who is my current group partner called out industrials, and i called out materials.

so i was under the impression that my group partner would want to work the industrials sector.

but when we spoke today, my group partner mentioned wanting to focus on materials.

but when we had minor group work together, my group partner went into the industrial set first, and then the materials set next.

this isn't a problem. really. but, i just don't know. if this is going to continue to oscillate back and forth or what.

what i'm thinking is. it really might not matter, the reason being that even though i might like materials, if.

well

it just shouldn't matter if i look at industrials or materials.

...

so what happened the other night? well, i was at the library later, I think about 45 minutes after midnight, I wanted to get a bunch of stuff done, but, I was tired, and there seem to be as many distractions during the night as there are during the day.

anyway. I want to continue working on my paper.

so in the example student paper, correlations are drawn between the index performance of the financials index, as well as the performance of the real estate index.

what what should I look at in my case?

what I'm thinking about is looking at the various correlations between the materials sector and various commodities.

so in the screenshot below i'm looking at the historical beta for the materials index and the

i think this is brent crude?

let me look.

okay, so it's WTI crude, but what does that mean?

...

















...

now what the hell was i thinking about? I think that i'm somewhat tired, and i'll come back to this later. it's just usually so crowded around here that I really can't get anything done, and I think that it's more or less the same issue.

...

well, i think that i've found something that I can amuse myself with whenever i think that i'm becoming distracted.

...

but it's basically this. I have an idea, and it is an amazing idea, and I think that most people will be impressed by it, if it can be executed in a way that people find interesting, and I think that most people will find it interesting because even when I just think about it, I'm intersted in it myself, and you think that most people will be interested in it, but, they probably won't be interested in it because it is such a trivial thing to pursue.

here is what I think about most things.

...

I can't figure out what the hell I was working on earlier, but I have found something that I'm interested in. I really have, and I think that I want to explore more of what I'm doing with this. and this should be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to the universe, and people all around the universe will be amazed with what I'm about to produce, and I will be quoted the universe over, by other sentient life forms, and even non-living forms of sentience, 

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

I'm going to look at the components in the materials sector of the  S&P 1500 index.

...

Well. truth is. I'm not sure where I was going to go with bond yields for the materials sector, I think what I wanted to do was to check into.

but i'm going to forget about this for now and look at something else. but what was it though? for whatever reason I can't recall what the hell I was thinking about.

there are other things that I kind of want to look into here as well.

...

and

"The brunette bartender at the Restaurant on Collins Boulevard"


her name is katie, and i distinctly remember her having 

blonde hair the last time i came here

this time she berates me for my behavior the last time

i came here, so are 

you going to sit at a booth the next time

you get irritated, 

or are you going to stay where you are?

i tell her i'll stay where I am,

still minutes later. no food. i'm really hungry.

starving. even

she has knockers and she's on collins

i order a bicardi

katie berates me for not having


for having taken a seat elsewhere the last time I was here

i order a tray of 6 naked wings,

but when they arrive they are drenched in
a sweet red sauce?
what is this?

what could this be?
it's sauce!

attitude.
she has an attitude.

it's not that i'm lacking in gratitude.
i'm hungry.

unlike the last time i was here I ate more than
enough.

and you still haven't visted the location in Dallas

the location in dallas is where the largest location is
really. you won't believe how amazing it is.
the largest in the united states, maybe even the world!

I'm in fucking Nashville.

* * *

it's a constant recalibration of what i need to do. filing for unemployment is a total waste of time. filing an unemployment insurance claim is a total waste of time. my claim never gets approved. nightmare. so what the hell do i do?

* * *

There is an issue of. i need to have enough student loan money to cover living expenses. i really don't want to resort to taking out private fucking student loans.

* * *

this is a nightmare. i think that i'll either. i think that i'll file the unemployment claim. and the disability claim.

i'm looking at my electricity bill. 55 fucking kilowatt hours! 10 dollars and 55 fucking cents. i'm home all the time now. so. i just have to figure out what the hell to do over the next few. hell. there really is no telling how long this is going to take. to find work.

if i do have to relocate. yeah. i don't really know.

* * *

i don't know if i should file an additional unemployment claim or what.

* * *

large butts. are part of the large butt industrial complex. small butts. are part of the small butt industrial complex. there are different industries. and there are different industrial complexes. that's just more or less the way that it is. that is more or less the way that it goes. there is something that i was thinking about.

sometimes designs put us at odds with one another. sometimes designs intentionally put us at odds with one another. i get that quiet spaces are needed. i remember. i found it difficult to accept a work from home position. because. me neighborhood was just too noisy at the time. it was hard to accept calls. it was hard to concentrate on work. it was hard to focus. sometimes it can be hard to focus. sometimes it can be hard to get things done when it's noisy. does it really enhance your concentration. well. who know. i do. i really do need to make a living. and. right now. i just don't think that i can do that. 

i think. it's a conspiracy on the part of the sell things industrial complex. i think that it's part of the industrial goods industrial complex. you have a problem. and we have the solution. i do not want all old things. i want all new things. i don't want a single new thing. i want all old things. i do not want anything other than high prices antiques that are sold by the most respectable antique dealers. and that's the only thing that i want. antiques. antiques. respectable. respectable. 

i remember. there were a few times when i worked in an office setting. and. it was noisy. and. in those cases. i was the noisy one.

i'm trying to compile my posts for Letters from Sanford Street. and this is the kind of thing that will take some time. what else was i trying to do? well. there was something that i needed to work on, but for some reason. it seems to have slipped my mind. i don't know how to deal with this kind of thing. it's possible that. he might just be trying to get an interview done or something. i have no idea. but he just left. and now this is easier.

i get. i understand that we don't always have our own private work spaces. we don't all have our own offices. and. these quite spaces are really needed. i get that.

part of the reason that i do conduct business. i do work from home when as far as work pertains to Chestnut + Hazel. is because i really don't have money for an office. not right now. any maybe the work from home thing does come with opportunities that can change things.

i think about the people who started businesses in their dorm room. or people who started businesses in their garage.

* * *

it doesn't take long for quiet spaces to become loud spaces. quiet spaces. everyone needs them. i think this guy is from the walking advertisement industrial complex.

* * *

i have to look for something. i have to look for a position. not because i need the money, but because it's relevant to what i want to accomplish. but the only think i really want to accomplish is to have more money.

* * *

i liquidated nearly everything in my robinhood account. i don't think that i would have ever done that. really. i thought that i would just be able to hold down a job. but i actually can't. i can't hold down a job. everyone picks on me. and this is true no matter where i work.

i have to think about what my next moves are. because this is a nightmare. i don't know if i'll be able to find work. or what. or what kind of work or employment i should be looking for.

* * *

alright. well I guess that's over. what a total nightmare. but right now. i really don't know what to do for work.

* * *

it wasn't too far back that i really felt that things were getting better. but they continue to be a disaster. what the hell do i need to do.

* * *

These last few days have been extremely challenging for me. Everything feels like a kind of sensation overload, and I have to look for work, again.

I have an idea. I need a residential address, and that was the purpose of the apartment on Sanford Street, although, I also lived there too. I mean, I'm moving back in with my mom, but, not really. I'll head back to Las Vegas. but I think that I'm also going to head back to Texas to set up Chestnut + Hazel, LLC while I'm still more or less a resident of Texas. One thing about trying to register in Tennessee was that you're required to be a resident of Tennessee to register an LLC in the State of Tennessee, I figure that it's the same in Texas. Kenneth Larot Yamat dba Chestnut + Hazel, and Chestnut + Hazel, Sole Proprietorship (SP) will still continue to exist, albeit separately from Chestnut + Hazel, LLC.

The Brunette Bartender at the Restaurant on Collins Boulevard (2022)

her name is katie b, and i distinctly remember her having
blonde hair the last time i came here
this time she berates me for my behavior the last time
i came here, so are 
you going to sit at a booth the next time
you get irritated, 
or are you going to stay where you are?
i tell her i'll stay where I am,
still minutes later. no food. i'm really hungry.
starving. even
she has knockers and she's on collins
i order a bicardi
katie berates me for not having

for having taken a seat elsewhere the last time I was here
i order a tray of 6 naked wings,
but when they arrive they are drenched in
a sweet red sauce?
what is this?
what could this be?
it's sauce!
attitude.
she has an attitude.

it's not that i'm lacking in gratitude.
i'm hungry.
unlike the last time i was here I ate more than
enough.
and you still haven't visted the location in Dallas

the location in dallas is where the largest location is
really. you won't believe how amazing it is.
the largest in the united states, maybe even the world!

what happened. well i freaked out the
first time i went to the restaurant
some guy at the bar started talking to me
and i asked if i could sit somewhere else
and it wasn't really the issue with the
bartender it was the issue of the guy at the bar
who would not stop asking me questions

in retrospect i realize that these are kind
of normal social interactions, but maybe
i just wasn't in the mood to engage in
a conversation with anyone at that particular
moment in time.

...

and so, now I backtrack. I head all the way back to Tarrant County, and then I head to Vegas. I feel like my life is nothing but a series of going in one fucking direction, and then back-tracking. Let's just figure out this dba bullshit first.

i have 2 fucking days.

I have to head all the way back to Tarrant County, and then figure out where to go from there. I mean. I guess I'll head over to Vegas. I mean, I have to figure out the whole school thing, and I really think it might be easier to just go to UTA, and somehow, you know, express the extraordinary challenges that I've faced these last few weeks.

...

I can file the dba forms with the Secretary of State first, and then the dba forms for Tarrant County afterward, once I'm in Tarrant County. I'll head out now. I'm really tired, and I would just like to get some rest, but, this is something that I do need to get done before I head to Las Vegas.

...

I feel funny about going back to Texas, and honestly, I don't really want to go back to Texas, at all.

...

and when I think about it, this is quite a bit of work for what is more or less a pen name.

...

Oh god, I have to actually be in Tarrant County Texas to register the dba, no joke, there is an option to file by mail, rather than in-person at the Tarrant County Courthouse, or at a sub-courthouse, but you need a notary that is in Tarrant County

...

So a dba is sometimes called an fictitious name, a fictitious business name, or in the case of Texas, an assumed name. In Texas, there's a requirement to file an assumed name, or a dba, with the Secretary of State, as well as with the County Recorder that you're doing business in.

I really don't see myself ever going back to the Dallas / Fort Worth area, but it's possible that one circumstance or another might lead me right back there. It was one circumstance or another that brought me to the Dallas / Fort Worth area in the first place, maybe one circumstance or another might bring me back there, but I really don't see that happening.

Who knows what could happen between now and December? Anything in the universe could happen between now and December, and so it might make sense for me to keep my options open, and that's kind of why I'm seeking "incompletes" for my courses, rather than withdrawing from the courses completely and dropping out of the MSQF program. 

While I'm here in Las Vegas I should probably find work. One of the issues about finding work here in Las Vegas is that once I start looking for work and once I start really setting myself up here in Las Vegas, it becomes less and less likely that I'll return to Dallas / Fort Worth. I didn't really have anything going on for me, other than graduate school, that was really keeping me in Dallas / Fort Work, and I was facing a number of issues in addition to not really being able to get anything done in terms of course work and in terms of studying, I had a number of problems going on that I really would rather not mention.

The dba is just a Pen Name, or pseudonym that I use as a blogger, but it's also the name of the blog, and the web domain, and, it's also kind of a business name, under which I perform the business of blogging. So, I registered.

Butter is not the Answer # 7 

I stated in Gallup, New Mexico for just one night, I hung out with one of the locals, and I really think that I liked her. I really would have considered staying in Gallup, New Mexico, still. I'm not sure what I would have done for work, or where I would have stayed or, whatever. There was something interesting at the hotel I stayed at. The hotel was actually somewhat fancy, and some of the other hotels in the area, the ones that seemed abandoned, or worn down, or otherwise kind of lousy, were the ones I really wanted to stay at. I wanted to stay at a cheaper motel, or cheaper hotel or something that was cheap, and also looked cheap. The desk agent was actually a person who was telecommuting.

I'm in Gallup, New Mexico. This seems like a tourist destination, but, it also seems like a college town too.

I have to think about something. I'm just trying to get my thoughts together. I applied for a few positions, but just 2, and I'm kind of wondering if I should send out a whole bunch right away, of if I should just send out a few here and there. So I applied for 3 positions today. I really don't know what to do about college. I set up my account for handling the student loans I took out for my first semester, but I'll look further into it later. There is one position that I saw open that I'm interested in, and, it's kind of in the same building that, uh. you know. i don't know. maybe i'll apply there anyway.

When popcorn seems like it doesn't have any flavor, be sure to taste it first, it might, in fact, taste like something, and if it tastes like something, then, by definition, it has flavor, even if it's not a very exciting one, but be aware: butter is never the answer!

There was stuff here before, and most of it was photographs that I collected from various social media sites and apps that I collected and posted here, but these things are silly, and butter, is still not the answer.

When you stare at a baked potato full of sour cream and sprinkled with cheese of this or that type, chives, green onions, maybe even cilantro; you should be aware of the fact that you are at liberty to taste the baked potato, but know this: butter is never the answer!

When you try to put a mushroom in a hamburger and things don't seem to be going as smoothly as you anticipated, know that you can use whatever you need to use in order to reduce whatever kind of friction you happen to be dealing with, use oil, because butter is not the answer.

There are times when butter is in fact the answer, but the circumstances where butter is the answer are rare. Suppose you're taking a multiple choice test and the question is: what's the answer? If the choices include: A) butter then it's possible that butter is the answer.

The other day I was collecting bottle caps from a trash can in a secluded back alley when two men with massive beards approached me, attempting to steal my bottle cap collection; the two men were carrying large sticks of butter that were sharpened with a butter stick sharpener.

Someone asked me about my clogged arteries and why they're so damn clogged up and I just had to respond to this person as directly and as honestly as I could, and I straight up told this person the honest truth: they're clogged, but butter is not the reason they're clogged.

I just applied for a position here in Las Vegas, and, I'll continue to look for work. I don't think that I'll be heading back to Arlington, it just seems like it's really not going to happen. I'm putting a few other things on the back burner for now. Like continuing to work on Chestnut + Hazel, more specifically, business registration aspects of it. I tried looking for positions at Amazon, but there was nothing available in the area. I was thinking that, since it's somewhat easy to transfer between locations with Amazon, that maybe I'd get in at a location here, and then, if something were to bring me back to Dallas / Fort Worth, that maybe I'd transfer back there. There's just nothing really in Dallas / Fort Worth, though, other than college, and even that was kind of falling apart. 

I did file a copyright for a few of my posts from the Letters from Sanford Street series, I used the "Online Literary Works" form, and it was somewhat more involved than using the Standard Registration process, but it does allow me to have claims on each individual post, rather than having a single claim one gigantic series. In this specific case, even though there is a single application for the 14 posts that I registered, each post is registered as part of a larger registration, using the previous method that I used, I would have to compile all the posts into a single post, and then register that single post as a "Collective Work" that I'd have a claim on. This distinction probably isn't obvious to someone who doesn't register copyrights, but an analogy that might make this easier to understand, is that it's like having 14 different deeds to 14 different 1 acre plots of land, rather than having 1 deed to a single 14 acre plot of land.

I also set up a mailbox at the UPS Store for my business, Chestnut + Hazel, and, even though I'm putting off registering the business in Clark County for the time being, I'm sure that I'll come around to it at some point.

you and it's obvious
that you really cared about
her even though she was
obviously a trouble maker
and she clearly would 
make life difficult for you
if she didn't get what she
wanted from you and now
you are out of college and
now you are lonely and now
you have to start all over again

an update to how things
are going right now. again
it seems I'm being demonetized
for something on my blog. I'm
getting rid of the suspected content
but there really wasn't anything
specific pointed out. and so
I'm going around deleting what
could be offensive.

it was weird. before i left she
came over and asked me to
take her out for dinner, and
i had been wanting to take her
out for dinner for a while. we
went out a few times. i don't 
think that she really liked me.
maybe she did, but i always
felt that she felt that she had
a better option, or that she liked
someone else more. sometimes
i'd be somewhere in the neighborhood
and then BANG she was there too.

we went to dinner. she came over
and asked me to take her out
to dinner, and we got into kind of
an argument when we were there.

and now the Nevada DMV website
is down, it's actually down and the
whole department is actually taking
time off until the issue is resolved.
so, even if I new what documents to
bring to a walk-in, i couldn't even
go if i wanted to because the offices
are closed.

i'm spending additional time cleaning up things here and
it just never seems to end there are so many
dirty things here that are not appropriate for the rules. the
rules
say that this stuff is not
okay
it is not okay to have yourself saying
and writing what you are saying and writing about

i went all the way across
town to go to a buffet called
imperial sushi and seafood.
it was a long drive. the food
was really nice, and, for 36
bucks it was worth the money,
but the drive was a nightmare.
maybe i just haven't ever been 
used to rush hour traffic. I don't
know why.

Butter is not the Answer # 8

Slices of rye toast are so boring! I've tried pepper, and I've tried salt, and I've tried using egg yolks, and I've tried using hashbrowns and slices of rye toast are still really boring! I think rye toast is antithetical to an exciting breakfast: jam? BUTTER IS NOT THE ANSWER!

...

I went to the deli section of the grocery store and ordered ribs and a large order of corn. I'm full. Anyway, I applied at Amazon, what was strange was that they didn't have any positions the other day, and today that had several available. It's kind of easy to transfer from location to location at Amazon, so, this keeps open the possibility of heading back to Dallas / Fort Worth. Gasoline in the area is kind of expensive, nearly 6 dollars a gallon.

What I'm trying to figure out right now is whether or not to get a Nevada Driver's License, and Nevada Plates. These are things that should be taken care of after moving to Nevada, but I'm not sure if I've really moved here. I'm not really sure if I've really "moved" to Nevada. 

...

A few hours ago, I went to the grocery store and bought a rotisserie chicken, and an order of potato salad, but I'm just not hungry enough to finish all of this. I have been gaining weight, and I have been getting fatter, but I've been a lot less hungry as well. I really need to get back to work. These last few months have been kind of a waste of time, if I think of them in terms of how they've added to my overall progress in life, but they've been interesting, and sometimes I think that maybe these interesting events in life, these interesting life events, do add to a person's overall life progress.

...

what the hell do I have to think of right now? i'm just worried about the future, but not in a way, where, i'm freaking out or losing my mind, or, where i feel like bad things are on the horizon. i guess i'm anxious about the future, and about what to do in the coming months. i start work on the 22nd, i don't anticipate anything going wrong. the idea of going back to dallas / fort worth and going back to school is somewhere in the back of my mind, but what is the most intelligent thing for me to do?

there aren't very many questions
and there are even fewer qualified
answers to those questions and there
are even fewer answers that are valid
and true
and you know with
great certainty that
butter is not the answer

...

butter is not the answer, Butter Is Not The Answer, BUTTER IS NOT THE ANSWER!

I while ago, and this was during one of my road trips, I was at a kind of shopping center, I wouldn't call it a mall because it wasn't all indoors, and I wouldn't call it an outlet shopping center, because, it really wasn't focused on discounts, but whatever it was, I really didn't go shopping, I spent my time going to the restaurants there. I think I went to three different restaurants, and at the last restaurant I went to there was this guy, an older man, and he was with his wife. I ordered a shot of gin, and, out of nowhere he says something like: "Gin, I haven't had gin since I was in my early twenties and vomited all over the place."

He was obviously trying to get a reaction out of me. I don't know what happened afterward, but there was kind of a discussion back and forth, and he eventually left, I'm not sure if he ordered anything, or if he was just loitering at the bar, pretending that he was going to spend a lot of money, and then, used his kind of, unpleasantness as a kind of pretext or reason for not ordering anything.

...

but I've noticed that over the past few months, that people at restaurants can be kind of. They interact with me in a way that suggests that they really don't want me there. or they want me to leave. I'm just there, and I'm just fucking eating.

...

but I think about different times, and different places that i've felt like i was being pushed out of. some things are related, and some things aren't. and trying to figure out which things are related, and which aren't related is something i kind of have to figure out.

...







The price of gasoline is ridiculously high in Las Vegas. I read that OPEC+ is cutting production in order to increase oil prices, and I'm sure that there are other variables as well. The gasoline prices that I encountered during my road trips was closer to 3.50 per gallon, and this was throughout the mid-west. It's just really high in Las Vegas.

I was looking for my nail clipper earlier, but I couldn't find it. I checked all my luggage and my car, and I must have lost it or left it somewhere. I need to keep my nails short. it's difficult to use my phone with long nails.

I have a bunch of stuff that I have to get rid of. For one reason or another I developed a habit of buying hammers or different designs and styles. I won't use most of these ever. I have no use for these.

Stay where the people are rather than
going to that place where the invisible
people are. That's where the nest is and
where the birds go.

I might be able to figure this out. I really think that I might be able to figure this out.

Okay. I think that I got it. I think I know what I have to do.

* * *

I have to look at this again.

* * *

What the hell do I have to do right now?

* * *

i'm thinking. I have a business. and I am a business owner. and I operate a business. It's called: Chestnut + Hazel. and it's an intellectual property business. and what i need to know is how to sell intellectual property.

i really don't need all this other information. I need to know how to sell copyrights.

* * *

what is the issue right now? it just feels like everything is falling apart. it really does. it really fucking does. and maybe. i'm responsible for all of this. and maybe. there were contributors.

* * *

I'm removing this idea. I'm thinking that. It would make more sense to patent an idea, and then sell the patent to a company that already has a business in place to market and distribute the product, rather than starting something from the ground up. It really makes more sense to approach it that way.

even though i'm making less money. i do have more time as a result, but this still feels like less time. or. it feels like it's not enough time. really. i just really hope that this. different trajectory that i'm taking actually gets me somewhere.

* * *

if i could explain my hesitance to spend any of my robinhood money it's this: like, my money is the only lifeboat i have. i can't beg other people for help. i would rather commit suicide. and i'm actually not even lying when i say that.

i would rather commit suicide than beg for help.

i'm just really sick of the non-stop difficulties that i face. it's like everything. every challenge i face forces me into some shitty ass corner. i'm hoping my shitty ass situation gets better. i'm sure it will improve, but i'm really facing shitty situations right now, and it's a fucking nightmare.

* * *

I really enjoy reading SPAM emails, but. right now. i really have no need whatsoever for no strings attached sexual encounters. even. even if these were actual offers of actual sexual encounters. that were actually. no. strings. attached.

aside from that. everything is a nightmare.

What else do I have to do?

Hi,

A study found that 63 percent of people
(https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/63-percent-of-20-somethings-want-to-own-a-business.html)
in their 20s want to start a business. I think that’s great.

However, there’s a big difference between starting a business and starting
a successful business, and young people may not have the experience that
comes from years of working in a given industry to know what the signs of
trouble actually are.

I’d love to write about that for your website. I’ll put together an article
for young entrepreneurs with advice on how to turn their great idea into a
successful startup. I'd be happy to feature your website as well.

The article is completely complimentary. I have a great mentor, and I
simply want to pay it forward as much as I can.

Please let me know if you’re interested.

Thank you in advance!

What the hell? these fucking things are jagged!

* * *

Let me think, just wait for the stuff I want to do, and then. I just really don't want to sell anything out of my Robinhood account. I don't want to sell anything out of my Robinhood account, any of my hobbies have to come out of my paychecks, and not my investments.

* * *

What do I have to deal with. Look, in this case. It really just makes more sense to wait to do a number of things that I want to do. In the mean time. it makes more sense just to do what I need, just the minimum amount of shit I need to survive for the time being, rather than blow all my money trying to do something potentially fruitless.

* * *

Wait until next week to do anything. This is just fucking ridiculous. 

* * *

The smartest thing to do for a number of things, is just wait until I get paid. I really don't want to take any more money from my Robinhood account. I really don't. So what do I have to deal with? just a few bullshits. I can't waste any money. I've already been doing that this entire month.

* * * 

In a lot of ways I kind of have to wait until next week to do a number of things. Well, I don't have to wait until next week. I simply have to. Well. I should wait until next week.

* * *

What the hell should I be working on right now?

* * *

I need to buy envelopes. what else. I kind of need to buy a battery for my car key, but I'm not really sure I'm going to worry about that.

One thing that is kind of cool about my new place of work, is that it is buy the University of Texas at Arlington Research Institute. I want to describe the area I work in as a kind of Industrial Park.

The thing I kind of want to patent is. and I honestly. I really don't have anything going on with it right now. is some kind of fermentation apparatus, you know:

A fucking home brew beer maker bullshit thing.

I want to check this place out, the Research Institute. 

I um. have or had this idea of: Chestnut + Hazel Laboratories, or Chestnut + Hazel Prototyping, or Chestnut + Hazel Research and Development, or Chestnut + Hazel Designs.

I have this idea for something I want to patent. It's nothing super interesting. I want to say that whatever it is that I'm going to make is a mere incremental improvement over an existing product.

Butter is not the Answer # 17

These are basically the things I need in Life to Eat the
butter, but I already established that Butter is not the answer, and
yet you did not listen to me.

When I think about it, I wonder what it would have been like to stay in Gallup, New Mexico, if I would have started a life out there. It wouldn't have been clear to me what I would have done for work, or if there really was any work out there for me to do. I'm still so unsure about this whole thing about being back in Nevada.

...

I ended up buying a new nail clipper when I went to the grocery store. There was one thing that was interesting when I went to the grocery store: there were large sections of the store that had locked cabinets. Even though the neighborhood I lived in when I was living in Arlington, TX was a neighborhood that I would think of as being, like a destitute neighborhood, I just didn't see as many things locked up in cabinets.

I changed the title series from "Postcards from Tennessee" to "Butter is not the Answer" and even though the title doesn't really follow conventional capitalization rules, I really don't want to capitalize "is not" and so I won't be capitalizing those words. There also might be an issue with this title change as well, but I'll worry about that later.

I updated my address on most things that I use regularly, but what else do I need to update my address on? I think that I've done it on most things. I returned my apartment key to the land lady. I closed my utilities contract with the energy provider. I mailed my mailbox key back to the Post Office.

...

Places that I think about. 
I might not see them again, 
but places that I've been to, 
that I might not see again, that 
I think about. Gallup, New Mexico, 
Somerville, Tennessee, and 
La Vergne, Tennessee.

These things have not been here 
the whole time, and they have 
not been the best of the best, and 
they have not been the sticks of the butter.

She asked me to send a photograph
of me, stroking a stick of butter, and
I had to tell the girl that it wasn't
really what she was after, and she
really did not want me to send her
a photograph
of me stroking a stick of butter.

What she really wanted was a video
of me making a duck bill with my hand
and sticking my duck bill hand into
a bowl of butter, sticks of butter
are not the answer!

Places that I think about. 
I might not see them again, 
but places that I've been to, 
that I might not see again, that 
I think about. Gallup, New Mexico, 
Somerville, Tennessee, and 
La Vergne, Tennessee.

and while some people wish upon a 
star, it's totally possible that I would
have to wish upon a stick of butter
and tell people that the butter, that
praying to a stick of butter, that
wishing upon a stick of butter is 
not the solution to the
it's not the solution to whatever issue
you are having.

...

One of the issues from the outset was figuring out how to divide the work, even then the other person didn't really want to divide in conquer, but rather, I would do everything, and she would just have the final say on everything.

If I were in a position where I were getting paid for whatever work I was doing, I wouldn't really give a shit, she could send everything back and I'd do it all over again, but I'm not okay with an arrangement like this in a situation where I'm basically paying to learn, and I'm getting bogged down by doing all the work, and then, doing all the work all over again just so some other person can claim to have had the leadership role in the project. Like fuck that. I just pray to fucking God that these student loans are forgiven, and I could just do something else.

I was using an external hard drive for the longest time. My previous laptop didn't have very much hard drive space, or memory, and so I used an external drive to get around that, but my current laptop has a large enough hard disk that I really don't need an external hard drive, so I moved all the files from my external hard drive to the hard drive on my laptop and reformatted my external hard drive. I really didn't have any important information on my external hard drive, just gaming files and stuff. Most of the games that I play are really old. I haven't really bothered to look at anything new.

I wrote an email to my graduate advisor about dropping both of my classes and withdrawing from the MSQF program. There was a social dynamic that I really had trouble navigating, and, just found it an overall difficult environment to get very much of anything done in. I just don't really see any chance of going back there, and even if I did, I'm sure I would have many of the same issues next semester as I did this semester, and so I think it's really best that I just withdraw in this case.

...

I feel kind of lost, and kind of stuck at the same time. I'm getting things together to file for a Driver's License and Vehicle Registration in Nevada, and I really think it's less and less likely that I'll return to Arlington, Texas, and to UTA for the MSQF program. I don't really know where to go from here.

I think that. Well. There is a recession looming on the Horizon. What's going to happen? How is life going to be more or less difficult in the future? How will life be harder? How will life be easier? Things are going to be amazing! Trust me! Things will go well, and things will be amazing for you! Trust that things will be Amazing! and they WILL BE AMAZING! YOU KNOW HOW LIFE CAN BE AMAZING!

Sometimes I look up people from different periods of my life just to see how they are doing these days.

This annotation to "innocuous post 37" is being written on 10/12/2022 04:17 PM

I remember writing this post. For a while after I moved to Texas, I started to pay more attention to the Mega Millions and the Powerball. I think that the main reason for this was that when I was living in Cameron, Missouri, I just didn't come across many advertisements for the lottery, or many billboards advertising the current Mega Millions or the Powerball jackpots. In a big Metro area like Dallas / Fort Worth, it was different, there were Lottery billboards everywhere, and everywhere I went there were people scratching lottery tickets, and, even that short month in January of 2022 when I worked at the gas station, there were tons of people who spent tons of money day after day buying lottery tickets and spending their lottery winnings on even more lottery tickets.

Every now and then I'll take an old post, and reflect on what was happening at that time, and then eventually I'll turn the old post into an "Archived Content" post. I looked at a few, and most of the old posts were about some of my initial thoughts about relocating to Texas. I don't think that I've written very much about my relocation from Texas. Not yet anyway. Lots of things just sort of went down the toilet after the end of February, February being the month that I went on a road trip to Louisiana and really fucked up my car in the process. Work wise, I think I remember quitting my second job at the Gas Station, the manager at the gas station was making the work situation more unpleasant than it needed to be, which made me think that she just really didn't want me working there and was creating a situation that would cause me to quit. Same thing at the Janitorial place that I worked 2 days at late in February.

Sometimes when I start a new position, I'm never sure if I should take things slow and not make any waves or rustle any feathers, or catch any one's attention, or, you know, sometimes I think that if I do take things slow, I'll be perceived as not being really interested in the role, or not being enthusiastic about my role.

I'm starting over again in Nevada. I really don't know what kind of long-term plans I have. I don't really have any long-term plans at this point. My thinking is that, for the next 12 months or so, I'll just reduce my debt and save up money for whatever does happen next. I just can't believe that I let things get out of hand like this. I wonder what I could have done differently. One thing would have been to relocate after the first road trip. The one back in June or July or whatever, but I don't really know, I had too many different things going on. Part of the reason I came back to Texas was to go to college, but that fell apart really quickly. I'm wondering how the fuck that happened, but everything was falling apart there, everything was falling apart for me in Texas, and really, to me, that means get the fuck out of there. I held on after the catastrophes I experienced in February, I did what I could and held on, and even school was an attempt to keep things going for me in Texas, but the school thing fell apart. So really, everything was falling apart for me in Texas. I "ran away" from Texas, but, I gave it a good 8 months and a good 50,000 dollars worth of effort to stay there after things were clearly going to hell in February. Maybe I did "run away" from my problems in Texas, but it probably would have made more sense to "cut my losses" early, and leave Texas, or started making plans to leave Texas, after February.

The only thing that I can think of doing here, while I'm in Las Vegas, is to reduce my debt, and increase my savings for as long as I can, and just have money and credit lined up for whatever happens. Every now and then things just seem to spiral right down the toilet. In San Jose, in Nevada four years ago, in Missouri two years ago, and just recently in Texas. Here we go again.

innocuous post # 37

somewhere in the ancient fortress town called
fort worth there is a winning lottery
ticket waiting to be purchased from bald
man number eight fourteen, he's soldering

a medieval random number picker
known as The Dart Board of Elysium 
which went downward through history, sticker
covered and glued with glitter and gypsum

to cover a crack in it's backside, and here
today, upon the bald man's desk, it sits,
waiting to reunite the forest's deer
with the savannah's antelope, which pits.

fuck this. the poem is fucking stupid.
i would much rather go right back to bed.

like where the fuck was I going to go
with that deer and antelope shit? who knows?

I was just thinking like. i have three lines 
left and i don't know where to take this damn
metaphor, dumb ass deer, dumb ass lions
stupid fucking dart board glued with green ham

and orange eggs. fuck. i had tacos once 
more today. glorious and crispy ones.

Butter is not the Answer # 19

you're wondering what
that feeling is. it's sweat!
you've been working out
and now you are greasy.
or you've been humping
your lover like the two of
you haven't humped each
other in years. you asked
yourself what that greasy
feeling might be. and
the answer to that question.
is not butter. butter was not.
and is not the answer to your
question.

...

okay. so what i want to know is. how does an emphasis. so. how does the individualized projects / team projects dichotomy reconcile itself with the work from home (WFH) / return to the office (RTO) dichotomy? and. i'm not trying to suggest.

anyway. i think that i've come with a solution to. like. how to respond. to any kind of. anyway. i'm not really going to worry about this for now because. i'm really not in that line of work anyway. and i have no intention of pursuing that line of work.

when i think about this. i just really don't want to suggest anything. i don't want to bring up anything that could. like. challenge the work from home (WFH) movement. i don't really want to say anything that would suggest that i'm anti-work-from-home, or anything. because.

and then, let's suppose hybrid-work environments. how do you hybridize individualized projects and team projects? what is the industry jargon for hybridized individualized collaboration work?

okay. i'll just take a position. if the team is the be all and end all of a project, then (RTO) would be optimal, wouldn't it? because you would have that additional layer of in-person collaboration that you just wouldn't get from tele-conferencing.

okay. so here. i have an idea for the. well. here's the thing. there are arguments for both sides of the return to the office (RTO) / work from home (WFH) argument.

one issue. one idea is that the (WFH) movement is a conspiracy on the part of the collaboration software industrial complex, how do we know this: cui bono! and, you could also say that, anyone who returns to the office (RTO) is, by definition, a team player, even if the person is a total introvert.

honestly, what side am i on? honestly: cui bono! i benefit most from (WFH) because i really don't like traffic. like really. why is there so much traffic. it's a car maker conspiracy! yeah. that's full disclosure.

and. yeah. that was really more thinking than i wanted to do after reading a short tweet and a few supporting tweets. 
...

I have a little over an hour before I should be checking out of this motel, I really don't have any money right now for another day. On the one hand there's this idea that the easiest thing to do would be to head back to Texas, I wouldn't have to go through this whole relocation headache yet again. I dropped all of my classes at UTA, and this is bad, of course, but it might be forgivable. On the other hand, I have a feeling that there's some reason for all of this traveling and shit that I've been doing lately, I really should be leaving Texas, but where the hell do I go? This area is just fine for finding work and setting up my business, and it's a kind of low cost of living area, I think. The issue with staying here is that when I think about relocating, I start thinking that I can really relocate to pretty much anywhere. Or to put it another way, when I think about relocating, I could probably find something that's slightly more ideal than this particular place.

...

So what are my plans now? I wouldn't mind hanging out here in Somerville, but, I eventually have to go back to school. I have to be in a city where I can find work, transfer into a new college, somewhere that's somewhat inexpensive, and that I can set up my business. I'm somewhat skeptical that I'll be able to transfer to a new college, given that I basically didn't accomplish anything during my first semester at UTA. This was a fucking disaster.

I found it hard to get anything done. The reason I wanted to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource for the course was because the Bloomberg Market Concepts Certification course was part of the Student Managed Investment Fund's requirements. I found the Bloomberg Terminal kind of complex to use, at first, but once I got the hang of it, I found it extremely useful.

Most of the analytical crap you would do in Excel, or in some other is stuff you can do in the Bloomberg Terminal by pressing the correct button, or, if you have some other formula or algorithm that you're working with, you can just plug it into the Bloomberg Terminal. There seemed to be this obsession with exporting data from the Bloomberg Terminal to work with it in Excel or some other software program to do some kind of analytical shit, but, it just seemed like an unnecessary extra step.

Anyway, I dropped my classes, and I'll see about getting into a college, or transferring into a college somewhere in Tennessee. It's 3:56 AM and I'm really fucking hungry, luckily for me, nothing is fucking open. I'm thinking that, okay. so. I can't really head back to Texas for whatever various reasons that prevent me from heading back there. I can't go back, and that's that.

I'm trying to think about what the hell went wrong there. Well, I guess I owe a bunch of money and didn't even so much as finish my classes.

...

I don't completely remember what set me off on that First road trip in June, or the one in February, or any of these road trips. Maybe I was thinking about relocating. I don't remember. I think that I'm going to relocate this time, but what the hell am I going to do for work? How the hell do I get set up in a new town? I need to find work, and an apartment. I minute ago I was thinking about heading back to Texas, but I really can't head back to Texas.

I'm thinking.

Notes Taken During My First Semester at the University of Texas at Arlington

...

Annotation to Notes from Arlington # 65

This was written during my June Road trip. It's September 25th, 2022, and I'm back in Tennessee. 

...

i stayed in Somerville tn for a night. im in the next town over, and i already feel like just staying here.

...

today is sunday. my thinking is that the roads should be empty, and it would be a good idea to keep driving.

...

i cant really go back to texas anyway. but i dont really know where to go.

...

maybe it was just time to leave texas. i had been there for 2 years. maybe it was just time for me to go. i really don't know what to do about college though.

...

i think that im just going to relocate. 
i'm on the Arkansas side of Memphis. 
i honestly don't know where the hell to go.

Everywhere is a fucking nightmare.
the nightmare never ends.
I really can't go back to Texas.

I have to leave texas. I really do.
I don't really know where to go, though.
this was a fabulous waste of money.

I threw away as much of my stuff as I could.
and threw away additional stuff on my way here.

I'll probably throw away 
additional stuff here 
and there
on my way to where 
ever the hell I end up.

i don't really know where 
the fuck to go at
this point.

I'm facing one frustration after another.

...

I'm really having a hard time getting my business in a more formalized state. I have the various things that I need to do on my calendar, but, sometimes there is no telling if I will get anything done or not, or if I'll get distracted by this or that issue, or, you know, who knows what will happen. I'm still facing a number of different challenges. and stuff. You know, like this and that stuff.

...

Class Notes Starting September 14th, 2022

one thing that I often face that impedes my ability to get anything done is the avalanche of emails that I have to deal with, or that fall into my mail box. I obviously don't read them all, but I usually scan them to see if they contain anything important.

...

Thinking. I'm going to hold off on looking for work right now. or looking for an internship or anything like that.

I really should just be focusing on school right now.

Butter is not the Answer # 9

I stayed in Gallup, New Mexico for just one night, I hung out with one of the locals, and I really think that I liked her. I really would have considered staying in Gallup, New Mexico, still. I'm not sure what I would have done for work, or where I would have stayed or, whatever. There was something interesting at the hotel I stayed at. The hotel was actually somewhat fancy, and some of the other hotels in the area, the ones that seemed abandoned, or worn down, or otherwise kind of lousy, were the ones I really wanted to stay at. I wanted to stay at a cheaper motel, or cheaper hotel or something that was cheap, and also looked cheap. The desk agent was actually a person who was telecommuting.

I'm in Gallup, New Mexico. This seems like a tourist destination, but, it also seems like a college town too.

what else is on my mind? Just facing quite a few challenges lately. It seems as though everywhere I go, someone or another tries to instigate a reaction. and it isn't always clear to me why.

June
July 
and 
August

were kind of a blur

same for the first part of September. I think that I went on four road trips this year. really long fucking road trips.

Notes from Arlington, Texas # 68

I better not buy anything that I don't need. I thought about buying a few wallets online, but I'm going to hold off on that for now.

Annotation to Notes from Arlington, Texas # 68

I really spent way too much money during these last few months. I really need to make my best effort to stay in school, otherwise I'm more or less fucked.

and again.

I really don't know how I'll be able to balance working and going to college at the same time. This might be a pain in the neck, but I also might be able to make this happen. Who knows.

I really don't want to wear hats anymore. I feel like they give me a headache. One thing I realize from being in Texas for several years now, is that, it's hot, and humid, and it's really easy to get sweaty and smelly.

...

I would like to think up a new series title, but I really can't come up with anything. I really can't think of anything.

...

This is where the orange juice 
sends the lemonade to the martini. 
this is where the mimosa and the

okay, so here is the issue. currently. i might be able to get some work done, but i'm not entirely sure about that. it's fifty-fifty.

...

Note: This is kind of a running page of notes.

...

it can be kind of difficult to get anything done around here. a total fucking nightmare. I doubt that any of us can really get anything done.


it's kind of such a nightmare. to get anything done/ it can

im not an indolent moron, nor am i an insolent ingrate. im tired. thats it. i guess it's a smoking room.

i ended up smoking in the room anyway. dont worry. i didnt have any fucking food. so i ate the nearest thing available. 

anyway. i know it took me a while to return to dallas, but, i figured that time was not of the essence, since compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe.

however. i have to figure something out. i cant find my fucking calculator. i havent upgraded since 1989. i dont even know if i still have that thing. shit.

...

always. if i visit Kentucky. i invariably manage to take the route back to dallas that passes through nashville. or vice versa, like last month.

...

This is the Third Time, September 3rd, 2022

kenneth larot yamat is currently subject to a nondisclosure agreement with an undisclosed party.

should any specific remarks be made about his complete inability to perform cunnilingus from monday 7:02 AM to monday 7:77 AM be discussed with anyone other than the appropriate parties invloved, he will be in violation of said non-disclosure agreement, the breach of which will require significant compensation in the form of additional specific performance of additional cunnilingus or additional performance based compensation in the form of substantially more intense cunnilingus for the remainder of the current artistic performance of completely unsatisfactory cunnilingus, requiring an additional cunnilingus session performed with all deliberate haste.

should he smell like anything other than pussy juice upon his return to his current residence, he will be subject to nothing less than multiple additional performances of additional cunnilingus. 

...

some young man made a defamatory remark a while ago. young. but thats the way it goes for kids his age. well. he left. so.

well. any chance he could. you know. he is.

...

i dont know whats up. but. i think someone out there is accomplishment blocking me. i tried to head back to texas so that i could attend class in person, however, as soon as i left indiana, there was a fucking monsoon, or fucking invasion from outer space consisting primarily of rain drops, which kept falling on my head. so i put on my hat.

i dont feel like drowning to death. right now. i asked the sheriff for directions, he said theres a hotel in the big city. i got there. and there was no hotel. i guess i should have asked the deputy, but either he didnt have a deputy, or the deputy was in invisible mode. so.

...

When I think about. I don't know what to say.

this is the third road trip in 3 months. i'm tired. and. im just so irritable.

i want to be nice, but, sometimes i end up in places i dont really want to be.

i really don't want to withdraw from school. i think that the discipline i'm pursuing is an important one.

i just don't know why i face the challenges that i face.

but this third road trip. really. even though it has been a nightmare, i don't think that the outcome will be as terrible as.

i just don't know what to say.

i really want to finish the program. im heading all the way back to texas. again.

It feels strange being back in Las Vegas, passing by the city skyline it just seems small in comparison to the DFW area. I really only saw the Dallas skyline a hand full of times, a few times when I moved to Dallas in 2020, and then, usually each time I left the area on a road trip. I feel funny. This feels really weird. Being back here. It feels different, it feels really different this time. Being here.

based on your
performance
i have no choice
but to tell you
that you're
a total loser

...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

but the .prn file that i was trying to open earlier was probably from a spreadsheet that was exported from someone's pocket calculator, and then uploaded to where i can download it.

...

think about 
what you did 
you total jerk!

...







 
...

 





...










...

today is tuesday. what did i get done today?

so. i think i figured something out to the internship / work search issue.

i'm going to use the bloomberg terminal.

anyway.

that's exactly what i tried to do this morning. 

i figured that. since today is tuesday. i can work on something other than coursework.

so i worked on the work search.

i didn't know where to start,
but

only in the sense that i didn't know
where
i wanted to start.

so i just started exploring the tabs.

anyway. a lot of the companies that i'm interested in don't really have any openings. many don't even have a career page.

so.

i just mailed out a bunch of hand written letters.

the first company I called up. i mentioned that they were listed on the campus job board, but when i went to their website, they didn't even have a career page.

the person who answered the phone mentioned that they didn't have any openings, and they rarely have open positions.

so i figured i'd mail them a letter, saying that i'm interested in working for their company one day.

...

what's on my mind right now? Tuesday. tomorrow is tuesday.

...

it was kind of tedious, but I did it. i really have to figure out how to put this into words. but I went ticker by ticker. i mean. it didn't take a hell of a lot of time, but it really was tedious. really tedious.

...

There was one silly issue that I had because, I don't know what this would be refered to in the spreadsheet application that I typically use, but:

It's Called Freeze Panes / Freeze Rows.

Silly.

...

So here is one thing. I need to use two sources, I need to use Bloomberg for the Expected Returns, and I need to use State Street for the weights within the index.

see screenshot below.

I'm trying to highlight how I'm using the information from both sources, Bloomberg and State Street.

...





...

Below is a screenshot of the "custom" tab for the watchlist analytics function, and I'm wanting to put in a formula, but I don't know how to format formulas for the Bloomberg Terminal.

the issue is i want to be able to do Excel Stuff without opening Excel.

...











...

okay. so there are more screenshots here than i can really discuss.

i'm looking at the watchlist analytics for S5INDU and S5MATR in the Bloomberg terminal.

There is one thing that I'm interested in. and it's the tap at the far right that says "Custom"

I tried working with it, but, I haven't come up with anything.
...

 






...


i think that i figured something out.

...

















...


S5INDU is the ticker of the industrials index - XLI is the ETF that tracks the materials index
S5MATR is the ticker of the materials index - XLB is the ETF that tracks the materials index


...

so what was it?

it was odd. 

the sectors i intended on focusing on was materials.

how it works in this class is that industrials and materials are grouped together for the purposes of group assignments.

i remember when sectors were being assigned, the person who is my current group partner called out industrials, and i called out materials.

so i was under the impression that my group partner would want to work the industrials sector.

but when we spoke today, my group partner mentioned wanting to focus on materials.

but when we had minor group work together, my group partner went into the industrial set first, and then the materials set next.

this isn't a problem. really. but, i just don't know. if this is going to continue to oscillate back and forth or what.

what i'm thinking is. it really might not matter, the reason being that even though i might like materials, if.

well

it just shouldn't matter if i look at industrials or materials.

...

so what happened the other night? well, i was at the library later, I think about 45 minutes after midnight, I wanted to get a bunch of stuff done, but, I was tired, and there seem to be as many distractions during the night as there are during the day.

anyway. I want to continue working on my paper.

so in the example student paper, correlations are drawn between the index performance of the financials index, as well as the performance of the real estate index.

what what should I look at in my case?

what I'm thinking about is looking at the various correlations between the materials sector and various commodities.

so in the screenshot below i'm looking at the historical beta for the materials index and the

i think this is brent crude?

let me look.

okay, so it's WTI crude, but what does that mean?

...

















...

now what the hell was i thinking about? I think that i'm somewhat tired, and i'll come back to this later. it's just usually so crowded around here that I really can't get anything done, and I think that it's more or less the same issue.

...

well, i think that i've found something that I can amuse myself with whenever i think that i'm becoming distracted.

...

but it's basically this. I have an idea, and it is an amazing idea, and I think that most people will be impressed by it, if it can be executed in a way that people find interesting, and I think that most people will find it interesting because even when I just think about it, I'm intersted in it myself, and you think that most people will be interested in it, but, they probably won't be interested in it because it is such a trivial thing to pursue.

here is what I think about most things.

...

I can't figure out what the hell I was working on earlier, but I have found something that I'm interested in. I really have, and I think that I want to explore more of what I'm doing with this. and this should be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to the universe, and people all around the universe will be amazed with what I'm about to produce, and I will be quoted the universe over, by other sentient life forms, and even non-living forms of sentience, 

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

I'm going to look at the components in the materials sector of the  S&P 1500 index.

...

Well. truth is. I'm not sure where I was going to go with bond yields for the materials sector, I think what I wanted to do was to check into.

I guess somehow figure how sensitive the materials sector is to interest rates. I could probably use the other chart to figure out a correlation between the two.

like um. ten year treasuries and xlb.

but i'm sure that. um. 

i really want something more accurate.

I want to figure out what each company is actually paying in terms of interest coupon payments and how this interacts.

but i'm going to forget about this for now and look at something else. but what was it though? for whatever reason I can't recall what the hell I was thinking about.

...

I wanted to look at something, but I'm not sure where I'm going with this. What I think I was trying to look up, was.

I wanted to search. something like bonds. or. i wanted to see how the bond yields compare for companies listed in the materials sector, and compare these to dividend yields for the same companies, but here is the thing.

I'm not sure if this would really mean anything. I'm 

I guess. I'm currently under the assumption. that the bond yields should be comparable to the dividend yields, but I'm not sure why I'm assuming this. I guess, I'm not sure what makes me think that the bond yields should be comparable, so I'm not sure why I would want to figure out if the information in the Bloomberg terminal would either confirm my assumption or suspicion or hypothesis or what.

there are other things that I kind of want to look into here as well.

...

anyway. I think that this is as much note taking as I'm going to do for the day, and then I'm going to head home.

...

So I think this is the 5 year Volatility and Risk analysis, and the citation for this screenshot should be styled as:

S5MATR Index Historical Beta 5 YR, via Bloomberg LP, Accessed August 28, 2022

Notes:

Historical Beta

and 

Regression Analysis

are the same thing.

I think, unless I'm missing something.

What I mean is, it seems that when a person is trying to determine the historical beta of an index, or some other security against a benchmark

it's the same thing as performing a regression analysis of an index or some other security against a benchmark,

and it's possible that I already learned this at some point in the past

or maybe someone already told me this before, or maybe I came across this somewhere or another.

anyway.

the reason I'm fussing over this mentally is that the other day I said something like:



"So I would basically pay twice as much for the full set, right?"

and then the guy said

"No, you would just pay double for all four over the quoted price of just two."

and this is always annoying because, it's possible that two people are saying the same thing using different words, but there is always one person in any conversation who really doesn't understand that the same thing can be said in multiple ways. 


...

















...

I figured out how to put all four of the things I'm looking at into a single chart, the only thing is, is that it isn't very interesting to look at.

SPX Index Comparative Returns, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP Accessed August 28, 2022 

so the part of the assignment that I'm trying to work on has me look at: 

Price Performance, Total Return Analysis, Volatility and Risk Analysis, and Those are for YTD and 3YR Periods

and Positive Alpha over a 5 year period.
...

















...

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

XLB US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPY US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022



...



















...

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

the issue here is that I need to put the total return for both indices into a single graph, and not have 2 separate graphs, but I forgot how to do that.

anyway, as far as citation styling goes, I think that I would style the first as:

S5MATR Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...



















...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of: 

(Bloomberg, 2022)

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

one is that I want to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource, and if possible, the only resource,

and

I want to keep whatever graphics and images and charts that I use in the paper and class presentation to be screenshots and screen captures from the Bloomberg Terminal,

the other thing that I want to mention is that when i'm searching the materials sector, I'm alternating the columns between the GICS and BICS classification systems.


...





...

It really annoys me when the weather is hot and windy, because I want to keep the window open when it's hot, but the shades won't stop moving when it's windy and the window is open. I'm thinking about Sunday, and what to do on Sunday. I didn't apply for any internships or positions since I last wrote about wanting to find one. There's this endless competition between my desire to work on things of personal interest and things of professional interest, and educational pursuits are kind of a combination of both, or maybe educational pursuits are at the intersection of personal interests and professional interests. 

...

One thing about putting notes on my blog from sources around the internet is that I think it might make more sense to take screenshots of what I find, rather than copying and pasting the material because I file copyrights on the text from my blog, and I obviously can't file a copyright claim for text that I didn't write myself, so to prevent me from accidentally filing a copyright claim on someone else's content, I'll just make a reference to other people's content using screenshots, rather than copying and pasting the text.

There is also this other issue with inserting images into my blog. The issue involves where the lines break, and I guess I just figured out what happens. so I guess I answered the question to the issue that I was having. so there.

...





...
...

The sector analysis paper is due before the Bloomberg Certification is due, so, I guess I'll get started on that first.
...


...

 i went out to eat. i was on campus for
several hours doing course work. what else?
I think that I'm going to work on something.


when I got home after going out to eat. and
spending time on campus. and then going
out to eat again, i um. had trouble turning
on my laptop and i was really frustrated
about it. but i eventually got it turned out.




...


I'm tired. and hungry.
it's 330 am.
what could i eat?


...

I submitted a copyright claim for the previous post
and I'm thinking that for this post I'll just make it
one big
well
what i'm thinking is that i'll take a different
approach to how i format this post and
i think that i'm going to skip out on creating


lines between newer content and older content
and i'm not sure how this will look or how it will
appear. but i guess i'll see.


nah. you know what. now that i think about it. i do
have to create marks that separate one train of
thought from another train of thought and kind
of demarcate where one train of though begins
and where one ends. so


never mind.
well. i kind of want to head back to campus to
get some work done at the library. i think that today
i spent about 3 hours in the lab. i went to lunch at


11 AM, arrived at campus around 1 PM and left
at around 4 PM. or a little after.


there is an event at the stadium and it's packed and loud
and noisy and i think that i'll wait it out for now. i did
get an email from the student newspaper, and it had
an article or an advertisement of an information
section about student housing options that are on
campus, and i think that i'll explore those at some
point.

Back Home, September 9th, 2022

Back Home, September 9th, 2022

i dont know what happened the other day. but i seemed to have irritated the bartender at this pizza place i went to. i really didn't understand what happened.

she seemed upset about something. she said that she wanted me to leave. so i paid and left.

a guy chased after me, and said: "No one here thinks that's funny."

and i still have no idea what i did, or what offense i committed.

i remember, i asked where the basil was, and a woman behind me said:

"the toppings are placed underneath the cheese here."

and i responded: "you're right about that, i've eaten here before."

and then i just sort of went at it with my pizza,

and then the bartender became upset.

my nails were dirty, really dirty, and i was eating two slices of pizza at a time. like a pig.

and maybe that was the thing, she was irritated that i was eating like a pig.

but.

i think that i was eating with a fork and knife first, and then
i started eating with my hands.

maybe i should just change my major or something.

i really fucking wanted to go to school, but, i don't really know what the hell to do.

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

but the .prn file that i was trying to open earlier was probably from a spreadsheet that was exported from someone's pocket calculator, and then uploaded to where i can download it.

...

today is tuesday. what did i get done today?

so. i think i figured something out to the internship / work search issue.

i'm going to use the bloomberg terminal.

anyway.

that's exactly what i tried to do this morning. 

i figured that. since today is tuesday. i can work on something other than coursework.

so i worked on the work search.

i didn't know where to start,
but

only in the sense that i didn't know
where
i wanted to start.

so i just started exploring the tabs.

anyway. a lot of the companies that i'm interested in don't really have any openings. many don't even have a career page.

so.

i just mailed out a bunch of hand written letters.

the first company I called up. i mentioned that they were listed on the campus job board, but when i went to their website, they didn't even have a career page.

the person who answered the phone mentioned that they didn't have any openings, and they rarely have open positions.

so i figured i'd mail them a letter, saying that i'm interested in working for their company one day.

...

what's on my mind right now? Tuesday. tomorrow is tuesday.

...

it was kind of tedious, but I did it. i really have to figure out how to put this into words. but I went ticker by ticker. i mean. it didn't take a hell of a lot of time, but it really was tedious. really tedious.

...

There was one silly issue that I had because, I don't know what this would be refered to in the spreadsheet application that I typically use, but:

It's Called Freeze Panes / Freeze Rows.

Silly.

...

So here is one thing. I need to use two sources, I need to use Bloomberg for the Expected Returns, and I need to use State Street for the weights within the index.

see screenshot below.

I'm trying to highlight how I'm using the information from both sources, Bloomberg and State Street.

...





...

Below is a screenshot of the "custom" tab for the watchlist analytics function, and I'm wanting to put in a formula, but I don't know how to format formulas for the Bloomberg Terminal.

the issue is i want to be able to do Excel Stuff without opening Excel.

...











...

okay. so there are more screenshots here than i can really discuss.

i'm looking at the watchlist analytics for S5INDU and S5MATR in the Bloomberg terminal.

There is one thing that I'm interested in. and it's the tap at the far right that says "Custom"

I tried working with it, but, I haven't come up with anything.
...

 






...


i think that i figured something out.

...

















...


S5INDU is the ticker of the industrials index - XLI is the ETF that tracks the materials index
S5MATR is the ticker of the materials index - XLB is the ETF that tracks the materials index


...

so what was it?

it was odd. 

the sectors i intended on focusing on was materials.

how it works in this class is that industrials and materials are grouped together for the purposes of group assignments.

i remember when sectors were being assigned, the person who is my current group partner called out industrials, and i called out materials.

so i was under the impression that my group partner would want to work the industrials sector.

but when we spoke today, my group partner mentioned wanting to focus on materials.

but when we had minor group work together, my group partner went into the industrial set first, and then the materials set next.

this isn't a problem. really. but, i just don't know. if this is going to continue to oscillate back and forth or what.

what i'm thinking is. it really might not matter, the reason being that even though i might like materials, if.

well

it just shouldn't matter if i look at industrials or materials.

...

so what happened the other night? well, i was at the library later, I think about 45 minutes after midnight, I wanted to get a bunch of stuff done, but, I was tired, and there seem to be as many distractions during the night as there are during the day.

anyway. I want to continue working on my paper.

so in the example student paper, correlations are drawn between the index performance of the financials index, as well as the performance of the real estate index.

what what should I look at in my case?

what I'm thinking about is looking at the various correlations between the materials sector and various commodities.

so in the screenshot below i'm looking at the historical beta for the materials index and the

i think this is brent crude?

let me look.

okay, so it's WTI crude, but what does that mean?

...

















...

now what the hell was i thinking about? I think that i'm somewhat tired, and i'll come back to this later. it's just usually so crowded around here that I really can't get anything done, and I think that it's more or less the same issue.

...

well, i think that i've found something that I can amuse myself with whenever i think that i'm becoming distracted.

...

but it's basically this. I have an idea, and it is an amazing idea, and I think that most people will be impressed by it, if it can be executed in a way that people find interesting, and I think that most people will find it interesting because even when I just think about it, I'm intersted in it myself, and you think that most people will be interested in it, but, they probably won't be interested in it because it is such a trivial thing to pursue.

here is what I think about most things.

...

I can't figure out what the hell I was working on earlier, but I have found something that I'm interested in. I really have, and I think that I want to explore more of what I'm doing with this. and this should be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to the universe, and people all around the universe will be amazed with what I'm about to produce, and I will be quoted the universe over, by other sentient life forms, and even non-living forms of sentience, 

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

I'm going to look at the components in the materials sector of the  S&P 1500 index.

...

Well. truth is. I'm not sure where I was going to go with bond yields for the materials sector, I think what I wanted to do was to check into.

I guess somehow figure how sensitive the materials sector is to interest rates. I could probably use the other chart to figure out a correlation between the two.

like um. ten year treasuries and xlb.

but i'm sure that. um. 

i really want something more accurate.

I want to figure out what each company is actually paying in terms of interest coupon payments and how this interacts.

but i'm going to forget about this for now and look at something else. but what was it though? for whatever reason I can't recall what the hell I was thinking about.

...

I wanted to look at something, but I'm not sure where I'm going with this. What I think I was trying to look up, was.

I wanted to search. something like bonds. or. i wanted to see how the bond yields compare for companies listed in the materials sector, and compare these to dividend yields for the same companies, but here is the thing.

I'm not sure if this would really mean anything. I'm 

I guess. I'm currently under the assumption. that the bond yields should be comparable to the dividend yields, but I'm not sure why I'm assuming this. I guess, I'm not sure what makes me think that the bond yields should be comparable, so I'm not sure why I would want to figure out if the information in the Bloomberg terminal would either confirm my assumption or suspicion or hypothesis or what.

there are other things that I kind of want to look into here as well.

...

anyway. I think that this is as much note taking as I'm going to do for the day, and then I'm going to head home.

...

So I think this is the 5 year Volatility and Risk analysis, and the citation for this screenshot should be styled as:

S5MATR Index Historical Beta 5 YR, via Bloomberg LP, Accessed August 28, 2022

Notes:

Historical Beta

and 

Regression Analysis

are the same thing.

I think, unless I'm missing something.

What I mean is, it seems that when a person is trying to determine the historical beta of an index, or some other security against a benchmark

it's the same thing as performing a regression analysis of an index or some other security against a benchmark,

and it's possible that I already learned this at some point in the past

or maybe someone already told me this before, or maybe I came across this somewhere or another.

anyway.

the reason I'm fussing over this mentally is that the other day I said something like:



"So I would basically pay twice as much for the full set, right?"

and then the guy said

"No, you would just pay double for all four over the quoted price of just two."

and this is always annoying because, it's possible that two people are saying the same thing using different words, but there is always one person in any conversation who really doesn't understand that the same thing can be said in multiple ways. 


...

















...

I figured out how to put all four of the things I'm looking at into a single chart, the only thing is, is that it isn't very interesting to look at.

SPX Index Comparative Returns, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP Accessed August 28, 2022 

so the part of the assignment that I'm trying to work on has me look at: 

Price Performance, Total Return Analysis, Volatility and Risk Analysis, and Those are for YTD and 3YR Periods

and Positive Alpha over a 5 year period.
...

















...

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

XLB US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPY US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

https://www.professionalplastics.com/professionalplastics/content/downloads/BallisticRatings.pdf

...

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

the issue here is that I need to put the total return for both indices into a single graph, and not have 2 separate graphs, but I forgot how to do that.

anyway, as far as citation styling goes, I think that I would style the first as:

S5MATR Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...

It didn't turn out the way I hoped it would. Things in Texas didn't turn out the way I hoped that they would, and I really don't know how everything went wrong all at once and I wasn't really prepared for all of that. I really wasn't.

...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of: 

(Bloomberg, 2022)

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

one is that I want to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource, and if possible, the only resource,

and

I want to keep whatever graphics and images and charts that I use in the paper and class presentation to be screenshots and screen captures from the Bloomberg Terminal,

the other thing that I want to mention is that when i'm searching the materials sector, I'm alternating the columns between the GICS and BICS classification systems.

...

I could put something here like the notes that I took, some of which were total non-sense.

...

It really annoys me when the weather is hot and windy, because I want to keep the window open when it's hot, but the shades won't stop moving when it's windy and the window is open. I'm thinking about Sunday, and what to do on Sunday. I didn't apply for any internships or positions since I last wrote about wanting to find one. There's this endless competition between my desire to work on things of personal interest and things of professional interest, and educational pursuits are kind of a combination of both, or maybe educational pursuits are at the intersection of personal interests and professional interests. 

...

One thing about putting notes on my blog from sources around the internet is that I think it might make more sense to take screenshots of what I find, rather than copying and pasting the material because I file copyrights on the text from my blog, and I obviously can't file a copyright claim for text that I didn't write myself, so to prevent me from accidentally filing a copyright claim on someone else's content, I'll just make a reference to other people's content using screenshots, rather than copying and pasting the text.

There is also this other issue with inserting images into my blog. The issue involves where the lines break, and I guess I just figured out what happens. so I guess I answered the question to the issue that I was having. so there.

...





...
...

The sector analysis paper is due before the Bloomberg Certification is due, so, I guess I'll get started on that first.
...


...

 i went out to eat. i was on campus for
several hours doing course work. what else?
I think that I'm going to work on something.


when I got home after going out to eat. and
spending time on campus. and then going
out to eat again, i um. had trouble turning
on my laptop and i was really frustrated
about it. but i eventually got it turned out.




...


I'm tired. and hungry.
it's 330 am.
what could i eat?


...

I submitted a copyright claim for the previous post
and I'm thinking that for this post I'll just make it
one big
well
what i'm thinking is that i'll take a different
approach to how i format this post and
i think that i'm going to skip out on creating


lines between newer content and older content
and i'm not sure how this will look or how it will
appear. but i guess i'll see.


nah. you know what. now that i think about it. i do
have to create marks that separate one train of
thought from another train of thought and kind
of demarcate where one train of though begins
and where one ends. so


never mind.
well. i kind of want to head back to campus to
get some work done at the library. i think that today
i spent about 3 hours in the lab. i went to lunch at


11 AM, arrived at campus around 1 PM and left
at around 4 PM. or a little after.


there is an event at the stadium and it's packed and loud
and noisy and i think that i'll wait it out for now. i did
get an email from the student newspaper, and it had
an article or an advertisement of an information
section about student housing options that are on
campus, and i think that i'll explore those at some
point.

...

Class Notes Starting September 14th, 2022

one thing that I often face that impedes my ability to get anything done is the avalanche of emails that I have to deal with, or that fall into my mail box. I obviously don't read them all, but I usually scan them to see if they contain anything important.

...

Thinking. I'm going to hold off on looking for work right now. or looking for an internship or anything like that.

I really should just be focusing on school right now.


...

what else is on my mind? Just facing quite a few challenges lately. It seems as though everywhere I go, someone or another tries to instigate a reaction. and it isn't always clear to me why.

...

June
July 
and 
August

were kind of a blur

same for the first part of September. I think that I went on four road trips this year. really long fucking road trips.



...

















...

Note: This is kind of a running page of notes.

...

I really don't want to wear hats anymore. I feel like they give me a headache. One thing I realize from being in Texas for several years now, is that, it's hot, and humid, and it's really easy to get sweaty and smelly.

...

I would like to think up a new series title, but I really can't come up with anything. I really can't think of anything.

...

This is where the orange juice 
sends the lemonade to the martini. 
this is where the mimosa and the 
mojito drink and eat and feel 
the ends of the earth.

...

okay, so here is the issue. currently. i might be able to get some work done, but i'm not entirely sure about that. it's fifty-fifty.

...

Note: This is kind of a running page of notes.

...

it can be kind of difficult to get anything done around here. a total fucking nightmare. I doubt that any of us can really get anything done.


it's kind of such a nightmare. to get anything done/ it can

Placeholder, still h

...

im not an indolent moron, nor am i an insolent ingrate. im tired. thats it. i guess it's a smoking room.

i ended up smoking in the room anyway. dont worry. i didnt have any fucking food. so i ate the nearest thing available. 

anyway. i know it took me a while to return to dallas, but, i figured that time was not of the essence, since compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe.

however. i have to figure something out. i cant find my fucking calculator. i havent upgraded since 1989. i dont even know if i still have that thing. shit.

...

always. if i visit Kentucky. i invariably manage to take the route back to dallas that passes through nashville. or vice versa, like last month.

...

This is the Third Time, September 3rd, 2022

anyway.

kenneth larot yamat is currently subject to a nondisclosure agreement with an undisclosed party.

should any specific remarks be made about his complete inability to perform cunnilingus from monday 7:02 AM to monday 7:77 AM be discussed with anyone other than the appropriate parties invloved, he will be in violation of said non-disclosure agreement, the breach of which will require significant compensation in the form of additional specific performance of additional cunnilingus or additional performance based compensation in the form of substantially more intense cunnilingus for the remainder of the current artistic performance of completely unsatisfactory cunnilingus, requiring an additional cunnilingus session performed with all deliberate haste.

should he smell like anything other than pussy juice upon his return to his current residence, he will be subject to nothing less than multiple additional performances of additional cunnilingus. 

...

some young man made a defamatory remark a while ago. young. but thats the way it goes for kids his age. well. he left. so.

well. any chance he could. you know. he is.

...

i dont know whats up. but. i think someone out there is accomplishment blocking me. i tried to head back to texas so that i could attend class in person, however, as soon as i left indiana, there was a fucking monsoon, or fucking invasion from outer space consisting primarily of rain drops, which kept falling on my head. so i put on my hat.

i dont feel like drowning to death. right now. i asked the sheriff for directions, he said theres a hotel in the big city. i got there. and there was no hotel. i guess i should have asked the deputy, but either he didnt have a deputy, or the deputy was in invisible mode. so.

...

When I think about. I don't know what to say.

this is the third road trip in 3 months. i'm tired. and. im just so irritable.

i want to be nice, but, sometimes i end up in places i dont really want to be.

i really don't want to withdraw from school. i think that the discipline i'm pursuing is an important one.

i just don't know why i face the challenges that i face.

but this third road trip. really. even though it has been a nightmare, i don't think that the outcome will be as terrible as.

i just don't know what to say.

i really want to finish the program. im heading all the way back to texas. again.







...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

are the same thing.

I think, unless I'm missing something.

What I mean is, it seems that when a person is trying to determine the historical beta of an index, or some other security against a benchmark

it's the same thing as performing a regression analysis of an index or some other security against a benchmark,

and it's possible that I already learned this at some point in the past

or maybe someone already told me this before, or maybe I came across this somewhere or another.

anyway.

the reason I'm fussing over this mentally is that the other day I said something like:



"So I would basically pay twice as much for the full set, right?"

and then the guy said

"No, you would just pay double for all four over the quoted price of just two."

and this is always annoying because, it's possible that two people are saying the same thing using different words, but there is always one person in any conversation who really doesn't understand that the same thing can be said in multiple ways. 


...

















...

I figured out how to put all four of the things I'm looking at into a single chart, the only thing is, is that it isn't very interesting to look at.

SPX Index Comparative Returns, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP Accessed August 28, 2022 

so the part of the assignment that I'm trying to work on has me look at: 

Price Performance, Total Return Analysis, Volatility and Risk Analysis, and Those are for YTD and 3YR Periods

and Positive Alpha over a 5 year period.
...

















...

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

XLB US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPY US Equity Total Return Analysis, 3 Year, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022



...



















...

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

the issue here is that I need to put the total return for both indices into a single graph, and not have 2 separate graphs, but I forgot how to do that.

anyway, as far as citation styling goes, I think that I would style the first as:

S5MATR Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

the second would appear as:

SPX Index Total Return Analysis, August 26, 2019 - August 26, 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28, 2022

...



















...

So what I need to figure out next is: 

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be: 

SPTRSC15 Index Members, August 28th 2022, via Bloomberg LP, accessed August 28th 2022

with an in-text appearance of: 

(Bloomberg, 2022)

here are a few things that I want to do with the paper.

one is that I want to use the Bloomberg Terminal as the primary resource, and if possible, the only resource,

and

I want to keep whatever graphics and images and charts that I use in the paper and class presentation to be screenshots and screen captures from the Bloomberg Terminal,

the other thing that I want to mention is that when i'm searching the materials sector, I'm alternating the columns between the GICS and BICS classification systems.


...





...

It really annoys me when the weather is hot and windy, because I want to keep the window open when it's hot, but the shades won't stop moving when it's windy and the window is open. I'm thinking about Sunday, and what to do on Sunday. I didn't apply for any internships or positions since I last wrote about wanting to find one. There's this endless competition between my desire to work on things of personal interest and things of professional interest, and educational pursuits are kind of a combination of both, or maybe educational pursuits are at the intersection of personal interests and professional interests. 

...

One thing about putting notes on my blog from sources around the internet is that I think it might make more sense to take screenshots of what I find, rather than copying and pasting the material because I file copyrights on the text from my blog, and I obviously can't file a copyright claim for text that I didn't write myself, so to prevent me from accidentally filing a copyright claim on someone else's content, I'll just make a reference to other people's content using screenshots, rather than copying and pasting the text.

There is also this other issue with inserting images into my blog. The issue involves where the lines break, and I guess I just figured out what happens. so I guess I answered the question to the issue that I was having. so there.

...





...
...

The sector analysis paper is due before the Bloomberg Certification is due, so, I guess I'll get started on that first.
...


...

 i went out to eat. i was on campus for
several hours doing course work. what else?
I think that I'm going to work on something.


when I got home after going out to eat. and
spending time on campus. and then going
out to eat again, i um. had trouble turning
on my laptop and i was really frustrated
about it. but i eventually got it turned out.




...


I'm tired. and hungry.
it's 330 am.
what could i eat?


...

I submitted a copyright claim for the previous post
and I'm thinking that for this post I'll just make it
one big
well
what i'm thinking is that i'll take a different
approach to how i format this post and
i think that i'm going to skip out on creating


lines between newer content and older content
and i'm not sure how this will look or how it will
appear. but i guess i'll see.


nah. you know what. now that i think about it. i do
have to create marks that separate one train of
thought from another train of thought and kind
of demarcate where one train of though begins
and where one ends. so


never mind.
well. i kind of want to head back to campus to
get some work done at the library. i think that today
i spent about 3 hours in the lab. i went to lunch at


11 AM, arrived at campus around 1 PM and left
at around 4 PM. or a little after.


there is an event at the stadium and it's packed and loud
and noisy and i think that i'll wait it out for now. i did
get an email from the student newspaper, and it had
an article or an advertisement of an information
section about student housing options that are on
campus, and i think that i'll explore those at some
point.

Back Home, September 9th, 2022

i dont know what happened the other day. but i seemed to have irritated the bartender at this pizza place i went to. i really didn't understand what happened.

she seemed upset about something. she said that she wanted me to leave. so i paid and left.

a guy chased after me, and said: "No one here thinks that's funny."

and i still have no idea what i did, or what offense i committed.

i remember, i asked where the basil was, and a woman behind me said:

"the toppings are placed underneath the cheese here."

and i responded: "you're right about that, i've eaten here before."

and then i just sort of went at it with my pizza,

and then the bartender became upset.

my nails were dirty, really dirty, and i was eating two slices of pizza at a time. like a pig.

and maybe that was the thing, she was irritated that i was eating like a pig.

but.

i think that i was eating with a fork and knife first, and then
i started eating with my hands.

maybe i should just change my major or something.

i really fucking wanted to go to school, but, i don't really know what the hell to do.

Notes, Thoughts, and Reflections While Using the Bloomberg Terminal 





...

so. i dont know. i was planning on just continuing to work on the project, but, i might just withdraw from the class entirely, and re-enroll next semester.

i realize that im not really the type of person who can work with just anyone.

so i really have to think about how to approach things until the end of the semester.

i have to think about why it wasn't a good match, but, she was working, and going to school at the same time.

and. i really don't know what to say about that. technically im working right and going to school too.

i dont have an employer. because im self employed and in the publishing business.

you know what. i never incorporated chestnut and hazel, or even got as far as registering an it as a company.

id register it as a partnership, you know, as the most logical next baby-step, but i feel that listing 

kenneth larot yamat, 

and 

kenneth larot yamat, the one and only

as partners 

would be perceived as facetious.

and i havent officially registered trademarks for chestnut and hazel, chestnut & hazel, or chestnut + hazel.

maybe this is a sign that i should go ahead and do that.

...

Okay, i figured something out.

the .prn file isn't for a pocket calculator, although it can be used in one,

it's for SAS, or the statistical analysis system.

...

this is really funny. i was trying to figure out what a .prn file is, and it's used for pocket calculator spreadsheets. 

here is the thing.

okay.

i had a ti-89 titanium

so i never bothered to learn ms excel, or, well. i guess i mean, i didn't really.

i mean in terms of years ago, when, i was in class and we had something or other to do in ms excel, i would just follow along using my ti-89 spreadsheet, rather than following along in ms excel.

but the .prn file that i was trying to open earlier was probably from a spreadsheet that was exported from someone's pocket calculator, and then uploaded to where i can download it.


...







 
...

 





...










...

today is tuesday. what did i get done today?

so. i think i figured something out to the internship / work search issue.

i'm going to use the bloomberg terminal.

anyway.

that's exactly what i tried to do this morning. 

i figured that. since today is tuesday. i can work on something other than coursework.

so i worked on the work search.

i didn't know where to start,
but

only in the sense that i didn't know
where
i wanted to start.

so i just started exploring the tabs.

anyway. a lot of the companies that i'm interested in don't really have any openings. many don't even have a career page.

so.

i just mailed out a bunch of hand written letters.

the first company I called up. i mentioned that they were listed on the campus job board, but when i went to their website, they didn't even have a career page.

the person who answered the phone mentioned that they didn't have any openings, and they rarely have open positions.

so i figured i'd mail them a letter, saying that i'm interested in working for their company one day.

...

what's on my mind right now? Tuesday. tomorrow is tuesday.

...

it was kind of tedious, but I did it. i really have to figure out how to put this into words. but I went ticker by ticker. i mean. it didn't take a hell of a lot of time, but it really was tedious. really tedious.

...

There was one silly issue that I had because, I don't know what this would be refered to in the spreadsheet application that I typically use, but:

It's Called Freeze Panes / Freeze Rows.

Silly.

...

So here is one thing. I need to use two sources, I need to use Bloomberg for the Expected Returns, and I need to use State Street for the weights within the index.

see screenshot below.

I'm trying to highlight how I'm using the information from both sources, Bloomberg and State Street.

...





...

Below is a screenshot of the "custom" tab for the watchlist analytics function, and I'm wanting to put in a formula, but I don't know how to format formulas for the Bloomberg Terminal.

the issue is i want to be able to do Excel Stuff without opening Excel.

...











...

okay. so there are more screenshots here than i can really discuss.

i'm looking at the watchlist analytics for S5INDU and S5MATR in the Bloomberg terminal.

There is one thing that I'm interested in. and it's the tap at the far right that says "Custom"

I tried working with it, but, I haven't come up with anything.
...

 






...


i think that i figured something out.

...

















...


S5INDU is the ticker of the industrials index - XLI is the ETF that tracks the materials index
S5MATR is the ticker of the materials index - XLB is the ETF that tracks the materials index


...

so what was it?

it was odd. 

the sectors i intended on focusing on was materials.

how it works in this class is that industrials and materials are grouped together for the purposes of group assignments.

i remember when sectors were being assigned, the person who is my current group partner called out industrials, and i called out materials.

so i was under the impression that my group partner would want to work the industrials sector.

but when we spoke today, my group partner mentioned wanting to focus on materials.

but when we had minor group work together, my group partner went into the industrial set first, and then the materials set next.

this isn't a problem. really. but, i just don't know. if this is going to continue to oscillate back and forth or what.

what i'm thinking is. it really might not matter, the reason being that even though i might like materials, if.

well

it just shouldn't matter if i look at industrials or materials.

...

so what happened the other night? well, i was at the library later, I think about 45 minutes after midnight, I wanted to get a bunch of stuff done, but, I was tired, and there seem to be as many distractions during the night as there are during the day.

anyway. I want to continue working on my paper.

so in the example student paper, correlations are drawn between the index performance of the financials index, as well as the performance of the real estate index.

what what should I look at in my case?

what I'm thinking about is looking at the various correlations between the materials sector and various commodities.

so in the screenshot below i'm looking at the historical beta for the materials index and the

i think this is brent crude?

let me look.

okay, so it's WTI crude, but what does that mean?

...

















...

now what the hell was i thinking about? I think that i'm somewhat tired, and i'll come back to this later. it's just usually so crowded around here that I really can't get anything done, and I think that it's more or less the same issue.

...

well, i think that i've found something that I can amuse myself with whenever i think that i'm becoming distracted.

...

but it's basically this. I have an idea, and it is an amazing idea, and I think that most people will be impressed by it, if it can be executed in a way that people find interesting, and I think that most people will find it interesting because even when I just think about it, I'm intersted in it myself, and you think that most people will be interested in it, but, they probably won't be interested in it because it is such a trivial thing to pursue.

here is what I think about most things.

...

I can't figure out what the hell I was working on earlier, but I have found something that I'm interested in. I really have, and I think that I want to explore more of what I'm doing with this. and this should be the most amazing thing that will ever happen to the universe, and people all around the universe will be amazed with what I'm about to produce, and I will be quoted the universe over, by other sentient life forms, and even non-living forms of sentience, 

inanimate entities, and consciousnesses from the void will come.

...

well. i'm going to start here:

I'm going to look at the components in the materials sector of the  S&P 1500 index.

...

Well. truth is. I'm not sure where I was going to go with bond yields for the materials sector, I think what I wanted to do was to check into.

I guess somehow figure how sensitive the materials sector is to interest rates. I could probably use the other chart to figure out a correlation between the two.

like um. ten year treasuries and xlb.

but i'm sure that. um. 

i really want something more accurate.

I want to figure out what each company is actually paying in terms of interest coupon payments and how this interacts.

but i'm going to forget about this for now and look at something else. but what was it though? for whatever reason I can't recall what the hell I was thinking about.

...

I wanted to look at something, but I'm not sure where I'm going with this. What I think I was trying to look up, was.

I wanted to search. something like bonds. or. i wanted to see how the bond yields compare for companies listed in the materials sector, and compare these to dividend yields for the same companies, but here is the thing.

I'm not sure if this would really mean anything. I'm 

I guess. I'm currently under the assumption. that the bond yields should be comparable to the dividend yields, but I'm not sure why I'm assuming this. I guess, I'm not sure what makes me think that the bond yields should be comparable, so I'm not sure why I would want to figure out if the information in the Bloomberg terminal would either confirm my assumption or suspicion or hypothesis or what.

there are other things that I kind of want to look into here as well.

...

anyway. I think that this is as much note taking as I'm going to do for the day, and then I'm going to head home.

...

So I think this is the 5 year Volatility and Risk analysis, and the citation for this screenshot should be styled as:

S5MATR Index Historical Beta 5 YR, via Bloomberg LP, Accessed August 28, 2022

Notes:

Historical Beta

and 

Regression Analysis

are the same thing.

I think, unless I'm missing something.

What I mean is, it seems that when a person is trying to determine the historical beta of an index, or some other security against a benchmark

it's the same thing as performing a regression analysis of an index or some other security against a benchmark,

and it's possible that I already learned this at some point in the past

or maybe someone already told me this before, or maybe I came across this somewhere or another.

anyway.

the reason I'm fussing over this mentally is that the other day I said something like:



"So I would basically pay twice as much for the full set, right?"

and then the guy said

"No, you would just pay double for all four over the quoted price of just two."

and this is always annoying because, it's possible that two people are saying the same thing using different words, but there is always one person in any conversation who really doesn't understand that the same thing can be said in multiple ways.

When I think about it, I wonder what it would have been like to stay in Gallup, New Mexico, if I would have started a life out there. It wouldn't have been clear to me what I would have done for work, or if there really was any work out there for me to do. I'm still so unsure about this whole thing about being back in Nevada.

66 miles outside of Las Vegas. I'm at a gas station just unwinding for a little bit.

Hum... back in Arizona I stopped at a Napa Auto Parts store and changed my wiper blades.

I'm about 160 miles outside of Las Vegas. I emailed my graduate advisor about my situation, and about the need to potentially withdraw from the MSQF program.

After staying the night in Roswell, NM I kept driving until I passed through Gallup, NM, where I stayed the night.

The next thing that I want to do is look at the ETFs for the S&P 500 Materials index vs the ETF for the S&P 500 index

The Citations should look like:

the second would appear as:

So what I'm I supposed to look at next? 

Okay, so I need to compare the Total Return for S&P 500 Materials Index against the S&P 500 Index.

How do I put this screen shot into the appropriate citation format? I'm thinking it should be:

Notes from Arlington, Texas # 67

I should. well.

Annotation to Notes from Arlington, Texas # 67

I don't remember what I was going through when I wrote this particular note. Maybe I was in a state of confusion or something. or Maybe I was thinking about something else. I don't really know.

Notes from Arlington, Texas # 66

That was a nightmare. I went on this strange road-trip, crossing nearly a jillion states, I ended up in the psychiatric hospital on a court ordered mental health hold. Something similar to a 51-50 in California. and now I'm back home.

Notes from Arlington, Texas # 66

What is the deal right now. This is an annotation to Notes from Arlington, Texas # 66. I'm thinking. This was a note from a while ago. I think this was after the June Road Trip. These road trips were interesting. A nightmare, but interesting as well.

this time she berates me for my behavior the last time

i came here, so are 

you going to sit at a booth the next time

you get irritated, 

or are you going to stay where you are?

i tell her i'll stay where I am,

still minutes later. no food. i'm really hungry.

starving. even

she has knockers and she's on collins

i order a bicardi

katie berates me for not having


for having taken a seat elsewhere the last time I was here

i order a tray of 6 naked wings,

but when they arrive they are drenched in
a sweet red sauce?
what is this?

what could this be?
it's sauce!

attitude.
she has an attitude.

it's not that i'm lacking in gratitude.
i'm hungry.

unlike the last time i was here I ate more than
enough.

I'm in fucking Nashville.

* * *

it's a constant recalibration of what i need to do. filing for unemployment is a total waste of time. filing an unemployment insurance claim is a total waste of time. my claim never gets approved. nightmare. so what the hell do i do?

* * *

There is an issue of. i need to have enough student loan money to cover living expenses. i really don't want to resort to taking out private fucking student loans.

* * *

this is a nightmare. i think that i'll either. i think that i'll file the unemployment claim. and the disability claim.

i'm looking at my electricity bill. 55 fucking kilowatt hours! 10 dollars and 55 fucking cents. i'm home all the time now. so. i just have to figure out what the hell to do over the next few. hell. there really is no telling how long this is going to take. to find work.

if i do have to relocate. yeah. i don't really know.

* * *

i don't know if i should file an additional unemployment claim or what.

* * *

large butts. are part of the large butt industrial complex. small butts. are part of the small butt industrial complex. there are different industries. and there are different industrial complexes. that's just more or less the way that it is. that is more or less the way that it goes. there is something that i was thinking about.

* * *

sometimes designs put us at odds with one another. sometimes designs intentionally put us at odds with one another. i get that quiet spaces are needed. i remember. i found it difficult to accept a work from home position. because. me neighborhood was just too noisy at the time. it was hard to accept calls. it was hard to concentrate on work. it was hard to focus. sometimes it can be hard to focus. sometimes it can be hard to get things done when it's noisy. does it really enhance your concentration. well. who know. i do. i really do need to make a living. and. right now. i just don't think that i can do that. 

i think. it's a conspiracy on the part of the sell things industrial complex. i think that it's part of the industrial goods industrial complex. you have a problem. and we have the solution. i do not want all old things. i want all new things. i don't want a single new thing. i want all old things. i do not want anything other than high prices antiques that are sold by the most respectable antique dealers. and that's the only thing that i want. antiques. antiques. respectable. respectable. 

i remember. there were a few times when i worked in an office setting. and. it was noisy. and. in those cases. i was the noisy one.

* * *

i'm trying to compile my posts for Letters from Sanford Street. and this is the kind of thing that will take some time. what else was i trying to do? well. there was something that i needed to work on, but for some reason. it seems to have slipped my mind. i don't know how to deal with this kind of thing. it's possible that. he might just be trying to get an interview done or something. i have no idea. but he just left. and now this is easier.

i get. i understand that we don't always have our own private work spaces. we don't all have our own offices. and. these quite spaces are really needed. i get that.

part of the reason that i do conduct business. i do work from home when as far as work pertains to Chestnut + Hazel. is because i really don't have money for an office. not right now. any maybe the work from home thing does come with opportunities that can change things.

i think about the people who started businesses in their dorm room. or people who started businesses in their garage.

* * *

it doesn't take long for quiet spaces to become loud spaces. quiet spaces. everyone needs them. i think this guy is from the walking advertisement industrial complex.

* * *

i have to look for something. i have to look for a position. not because i need the money, but because it's relevant to what i want to accomplish. but the only think i really want to accomplish is to have more money.

* * *

i liquidated nearly everything in my robinhood account. i don't think that i would have ever done that. really. i thought that i would just be able to hold down a job. but i actually can't. i can't hold down a job. everyone picks on me. and this is true no matter where i work.

i have to think about what my next moves are. because this is a nightmare. i don't know if i'll be able to find work. or what. or what kind of work or employment i should be looking for.

* * *

alright. well I guess that's over. what a total nightmare. but right now. i really don't know what to do for work.

* * *

it wasn't too far back that i really felt that things were getting better. but they continue to be a disaster. what the hell do i need to do.

* * *

These last few days have been extremely challenging for me. Everything feels like a kind of sensation overload, and I have to look for work, again.

* * *

Butter is not the Answer # 18

I bought a carton of egg nog and drank it all. I'm kind of just hanging out in my car and I'm probably going to go back in and get something else. There's nothing to do at home, but I'm not bored to the point that I really want to go prowl the streets. I think that I've taken care of most of the stuff, the preliminary stuff related to relocating, I have to change my addresses in my accounts first, then once I have statements, then I can go to the Nevada DMV to request a Nevada Driver's License, and then I can request Nevada Vehicle Registration.

When I think about it, I wonder what it would have been like to stay in Gallup, New Mexico, if I would have started a life out there. It wouldn't have been clear to me what I would have done for work, or if there really was any work out there for me to do. I'm still so unsure about this whole thing about being back in Nevada.

...

I ended up buying a new nail clipper when I went to the grocery store. There was one thing that was interesting when I went to the grocery store: there were large sections of the store that had locked cabinets. Even though the neighborhood I lived in when I was living in Arlington, TX was a neighborhood that I would think of as being, like a destitute neighborhood, I just didn't see as many things locked up in cabinets.

I changed the title series from "Postcards from Tennessee" to "Butter is not the Answer" and even though the title doesn't really follow conventional capitalization rules, I really don't want to capitalize "is not" and so I won't be capitalizing those words. There also might be an issue with this title change as well, but I'll worry about that later.

I updated my address on most things that I use regularly, but what else do I need to update my address on? I think that I've done it on most things. I returned my apartment key to the land lady. I closed my utilities contract with the energy provider. I mailed my mailbox key back to the Post Office.

...

Places that I think about. I might not see them again, but places that I've been to, that I might not see again, that I think about. Gallup, New Mexico, Somerville, Tennessee, and La Vergne, Tennessee.

She asked me to send a photograph
of me, stroking a stick of butter, and
I had to tell the girl that it wasn't
really what she was after, and she
really did not want me to send her
a photograph
of me stroking a stick of butter.

What she really wanted was a video
of me making a duck bill with my hand
and sticking my duck bill hand into
a bowl of butter, sticks of butter
are not the answer!

Butter is not the Answer # 15

I think about times in my life where I'm going through the kinds of things I'm going through right now. I don't know how to describe how it's different this time, but it is different. It's different because things are confusing; I'm confused about how to deal with; I'm confused about how to move forward, and I'm confused about what to do next, but things aren't really all that bleak right now, things really aren't all that hopeless. Things are just confusing. I just really don't know what to do next.

I think that I'm just going to operate under the assumption that Nevada is where I'm going to be for now, and I'll just go through with getting a Nevada Driver's License, and Nevada Plates.

...

What I'm trying to figure out right now is whether or not to get a Nevada Driver's License, and Nevada Plates. These are things that should be taken care of after moving to Nevada, but I'm not sure if I've really moved here. I'm not really sure if I've really "moved" to Nevada. 

...

A few hours ago, I went to the grocery store and bought a rotisserie chicken, and an order of potato salad, but I'm just not hungry enough to finish all of this. I have been gaining weight, and I have been getting fatter, but I've been a lot less hungry as well. I really need to get back to work. These last few months have been kind of a waste of time, if I think of them in terms of how they've added to my overall progress in life, but they've been interesting, and sometimes I think that maybe these interesting events in life, these interesting life events, do add to a person's overall life progress.

...

what the hell do I have to think of right now? i'm just worried about the future, but not in a way, where, i'm freaking out or losing my mind, or, where i feel like bad things are on the horizon. i guess i'm anxious about the future, and about what to do in the coming months. i start work on the 22nd, i don't anticipate anything going wrong. the idea of going back to dallas / fort worth and going back to school is somewhere in the back of my mind, but what is the most intelligent thing for me to do?

Poem

Butter is not the Answer # 16

it's possible to drown most
of the problems of life, the struggles
the ups and downs, and even 
many of the sadnesses you face
with olive oil, and wine, and whine
but just be aware
of the fact that butter is not the answer.
you think that crispy chicken is 
created with the buttery goodness
of something other than lard and
hydrogenated soybean oil?
Think Again! It's something else!
not butter! butter is not the answer!

Poem

Butter is not the Answer # 15

there aren't very many questions
and there are even fewer qualified
answers to those questions and there
are even fewer answers that are valid
and true
and you know with
great certainty that
butter is not the answer

Part of what I'm doing right now
is cutting out things that really
aren't related to this post.
butter is not the answer, 
and some of the stuff is old
tweets that, in retrospect,
were kind of disturbing.

Butter Is Not The Answer,
when you write things that
are disturbing. or rather
when I write things that are
disturbing; I won't always know
at that particular moment that 
what I wrote was off, or odd. 
BUTTER IS NOT THE ANSWER!

...

I while ago, and this was during one of my road trips, I was at a kind of shopping center, I wouldn't call it a mall because it wasn't all indoors, and I wouldn't call it an outlet shopping center, because, it really wasn't focused on discounts, but whatever it was, I really didn't go shopping, I spent my time going to the restaurants there. I think I went to three different restaurants, and at the last restaurant I went to there was this guy, an older man, and he was with his wife. I ordered a shot of gin, and, out of nowhere he says something like: "Gin, I haven't had gin since I was in my early twenties and vomited all over the place."

He was obviously trying to get a reaction out of me. I don't know what happened afterward, but there was kind of a discussion back and forth, and he eventually left, I'm not sure if he ordered anything, or if he was just loitering at the bar, pretending that he was going to spend a lot of money, and then, used his kind of, unpleasantness as a kind of pretext or reason for not ordering anything.

...

but I've noticed that over the past few months, that people at restaurants can be kind of. They interact with me in a way that suggests that they really don't want me there. or they want me to leave. I'm just there, and I'm just fucking eating.

...

but I think about different times, and different places that i've felt like i was being pushed out of. some things are related, and some things aren't. and trying to figure out which things are related, and which aren't related is something i kind of have to figure out.

...

I think of iteration in engineering
as being similar to evolution in biology

one benefit to smaller teams and individualized

can progress in isolation, and the products created

...

alright. done. i really didn't give 
the computer shopping thing too 
much thought. or time. but i need 
to also look at laptop computers. 
i think during this search. i focused 
on tablet computers. and then I realized
that I would rather wear a hat on my
head. so that's what i did. he also seemed
like a total jerk when he called me asking
me to appear at his office in person.

...

is there anything that I need to do? 
yes! okay. so I remember. i have 
to look at computers for school.

...

what the hell was it that 
i was thinking about?
well. I'll tell you:

I was thinking about how butter
is clearly not the answer to your 
problem, a problem known as 
making bland and boring and
tasteless food. that's your problem
and honestly, butter is not the answer.

...

is there anything that i need to do today? 
i checked my UTA email, but i don't think 
that i would have had a response 
over the weekend.

...

is there anything that I need to fucking do today? i spent most of the day goofing off. i stayed up late the previous night and i've hardly had any sleep. well. except for the fact that i slept for most of the day today. but before i slept most of the day today. i didn't have much sleep.


What I'm I dealing with right now? I tried withdrawing from the MSQF program at UTA, but it's not as simple as clicking a button and withdrawing, and dropping out, if it was that easy, that's probably what I would have done; on the one hand, I don't really want to drop out, and on the other hand, I don't really see myself going back to the Dallas / Fort Worth area.

I really don't see myself ever going back to the Dallas/ Fort Worth area, but it's possible that one circumstance or another might lead me right back there. It was one circumstance or another that brought me to the Dallas / Fort Worth area in the first place, maybe one circumstance or another might bring me back there, but I really don't see that happening.

Who knows what could happen between now and December? Anything in the universe could happen between now and December, and so it might make sense for me to keep my options open, and that's kind of why I'm seeking "incompletes" for my courses, rather than withdrawing from the courses completely and dropping out of the MSQF program. 

While I'm here in Las Vegas I should probably find work. One of the issues about finding work here in Las Vegas is that once I start looking for work and once I start really setting myself up here in Las Vegas, it becomes less and less likely that I'll return to Dallas / Fort Worth. I didn't really have anything going on for me, other than graduate school, that was really keeping me in Dallas / Fort Work, and I was facing a number of issues in addition to not really being able to get anything done in terms of course work and in terms of studying, I had a number of problems going on that I really would rather not mention.

...

I might need to get an emissions inspection for Nevada, but I'm not really sure. I bought my car new; I registered it in Missouri, then transferred registration to Texas, and now I'm trying to register my car in Nevada, and I'm not sure what the "three registrations exemption" refers to. Even though I've registered in two different states, and this Nevada move will be a third registration, I'm thinking that the number of registrations refers to the number of different times a vehicle has been registered by different owners, and not by the same owner re-registering in different states multiple times.

...

With the Nevada DMV website down there isn't really anything for me to work on, but, even if it was up, there isn't really much for me to work on right now. I think that I have whatever I need to get registered and set up in Nevada, and I think that I really just have to wait until I start work.

I was thinking about setting up an online store to sell the stuff I don't need, but like this is mostly just used stuff that I need to sell. I could donate it all, but I don't get the experience of setting up an online store, though. I think that I'll try it. 

...

This is actually the best name I can come up with for the series. The first post had something in the way of a million different names, I kept changing it, but I think that I'll keep this name and leave it this way. I think that I started with Postcards from Tennessee, but that title series seemed inappropriate because I really wasn't in Tennessee for more than a few days, and I only wrote a handful of posts while I was there, and then, Butter is not the Answer was amusing, but I don't know what to do with that one. When it comes to figuring out like, everything else, I'm kind of lost. I really don't know what to do, or, I really don't have any kind of grand plan or anything.

...

Dropping my classes at UTA and withdrawing from the MSQF program is kind of rolling at this point. I thought briefly that, somehow it may have been possible to. I have no idea, stay enrolled, and then attend next semester, and hope for a different outcome, but the odds are really against me. I mean I would have to drive from Las Vegas to Dallas and back once a week if I pursued that course of action, or maybe I would live in Dallas, or maybe I would relocated right back to Texas after relocating to Nevada? A lot of those ideas simply weren't workable.

Even though I set up an appointment to visit the Nevada DMV, it's actually possible to just walk in, without an appointment. I don't know what to do about the whole emissions inspection crap. I don't really think that I actually need to get one, I think that my vehicle is exempt, but I don't want to spend all day at the DMV waiting in line, just to be told to come back, and spend a whole day waiting in line again because I actually do need an emissions inspection.

Reading my horoscope. There is really no consistent message from the various horoscope writers. Sometimes I just look for something encouraging. I remember doing this a while ago, but what I remember is that nothing that I read from the horoscopes really leads me in one direction or another. One horoscope will advise me against doing such and such activity, and another will advise me to be proactive and get involved in such and such activity that the previous horoscope just advised against pursuing. So. Whatever.

...

This is actually pretty cool. My work shoes arrived. Um, the other thing that was pretty interesting was that my Assumed Name filings have been registered with Tarrant County, but there seems to be a delay with the Assumed Name filings that I submitted registrations for the with Secretary of State of Texas. A lot of this stuff is kind of unnecessary, I don't really have any buyers for any of my writing, or my content, or anything creative that I've produced.

...

I legitimately don't know what the hell to do. I'm really fucking. Like lost here. The best thing. The best idea I have right now is to wait and see, maybe something will pop up. Just work and get settled in. I'm hoping for overtime, it makes it easier to save a larger percentage of my earnings, but I'm thinking, maybe, maybe I might do some gig work or something. Or find a part time second job. I'm irritated that the UTA thing is basically over, but I don't really think that I'm done pursuing graduate school. I'm where to go from here.

Um, the other thing that was pretty interesting was that my Assumed Name filings have been registered with Tarrant County, but there seems to be a delay with the Assumed Name filings that I submitted registrations for the with Secretary of State of Texas. A lot of this stuff is kind of unnecessary, I don't really have any buyers for any of my writing, or my content, or anything creative that I've produced.

...























































































So, even though I haven't lived in California in a long time, technically I'm a legal resident of California, I haven't lived in any other state for longer than five fucking years. 1 in Nevada, 2 in Missouri, 2.5 in Texas.

hum. well, uta doesn't have a creative writing program. there is an mfa program, but it seems to be for studio art or visual art. i'm working on an application to UNLV, the earliest semester for admission to the mfa program is fall 2023

...

Sometimes when I'm watching documentaries on historical battles I get into this mood where I want to waste time playing Total War on my computer. I know that playing computer games really doesn't accomplish anything, but so many things in life don't really accomplish anything anyway. So, what does it matter? My computer was running really slow, and it continues to run slow under certain circumstances, but I messed around with it and turned off a bunch of programs that were running in the background, and it seems to be working better. I was seriously considering buying a new computer, but I don't think that I will unless it runs horribly slow.

Everything is kind of a disaster right now. Really. everything is a total nightmare disaster kind of ninth circle of hell situation right now. I don't know where to go from here, and I really don't know what direction to take things to make things better, but I just don't know what the hell to do right now. This is a nightmare. My thinking right now is that I have to stop and restrategize.

Anyway. I do have something funny to say, and it's this: I feel an affinity with UK Prime Minister Liz Truss; I dropped out of grad school after six weeks! I just was not able. To accomplish a fucking thing. There are a number of lingering issues with withdrawing from the MSQF program at UTA and it's really just not as simple or as easy as saying: "look, I fucking quit!" In fact, based on the particular situation I'm facing right now, I basically asked for my request to withdraw from the MSQF program to be reversed.

When I think about these last four years, from the time I left the Las Vegas area, until now, where I'm back in the Las Vegas area, I think about the two years I spent in Missouri, and about the two years I spent in Texas, I feel like in either of those two year blocks of time I really would have been happy just working and saving money, and eventually, doing something, but what? I have no idea. In both cases everything I saved more or less evaporated and I had to start again. 

There are times when things are okay, and times when things start not going well, and then times when things start to go to hell again.

...

I reverted the layout to something similar to how the blog used to be. I just didn't really like the new template. I did manage to clean a few things up, and I think that I'm going to retitle things as I come across them, and maybe change a few things here and there. I don't really know what I want to do with this thing. There is a possible thing that's going to be an issue in the near future, unless something changes, but this is potentially a disaster, a near term disaster. I don't even really want to go into details right now because this is really bad. Potentially. but who knows. It's never really possible to completely leave things behind, sometimes there's always something that goes with you. There are always a few things that come with you even after you go. Which is kind of a nightmare. I think. Well, we will find out. I'm deleting things even though I've previously been averse to deleting things. From my blog. I mean.

...

The other day I was thinking that it's really nice to be tired because it's really nice to fall asleep as a result of being tired, rather than falling asleep because I have nothing better to do.

I want to go into the details about the issues I'm facing in terms of UTA and the DOE student loans and all the nonsense I have to deal with. I'm just finding it difficult to explain. I'm pissed about the way things turned out this first semester, but I'm not totally burned to the point of being completely deterred from going to graduate school.

There are certain things that I need right now, but that I can hold off on. I need an oil change, and tires. she's cute, and. she's kind of talking to herself. and it seems like a very engaging conversation. maybe she's singing.

I'm kind of tired. There was an opportunity to sign up for overtime after the end of my shift this morning, so I signed up. In a way I kind of want to take it easy, but really, the best thing to do is take any overtime that I can get and get my finances back in order. I'm sure there will be time to relax later. I think about how I kind of didn't really do anything for the last several months, and I think that if I could have done things differently, I would have done nothing in a way that would be more enjoyable.

...

I was so tired toward the end of my shift last night. I haven't worked in five months or so, and I guess my body just needs to get back into the rhythm of working again. At the end of my shift I went to the gas station to get food, and I was just shocked with how expensive it was. I had three hot dogs and a soda refill, and I guess I won't be going to that gas station again, for breakfast anyway. I still might need gas, and who knows when or where I'll need gas. I'm sure that my life is going to get on track again, but this is going to be a long journey back to, you know, where ever the hell I was financially. I think about those times after a natural disaster when people rebuild their towns and homes and cities, and I think about my life and how I'm rebuilding my life after this disaster that happened over the last few months of my life. Disaster. Rebuild. Grow. Live. Disaster. Rebuild. Grow. Live.

I'm thinking about something, and this something is stressing me out right now.

I'm at work, and my mobile service provided doesn't really have much of a connection in this part of town.

This is where
you are and 
where you will
always be because

this is where the 
rainbow ends
and this is where
the pot of gold is
and this is where
leprechauns hang
out and here you
can tell me what

you are looking for in terms of
gold and silver and there was nothing
there for anyone to do and there was
nothing interesting that may have been
there and you can see what the end of
the taste is and you can sense what
you continue to feel. why do you feel
that way? ask yourself and you will
come up with an answer, but it might
or it might not be the right answer.

...

I really want to buy 
some new clothes 
right now, but I just 
don't need any.

and I don't know if this is the
kind of thing that I should do
anyway to elevate my mood.

I think that there are times when
I skimp on simple pleasures, only
to really obliterate my money on
other things that I really do not
enjoy or appreciate or even really
want to spend any of my money on.

...

Outside it sounds like
it's raining, but when I
go outside it turns out
that it's not raining. It's
just the wind blowing
through the leave of
the trees, and the sound
that this process makes
resembles the sound of
rain. That's what it was.
It wasn't butter melting
on a stove nor was it rain.
it was just the wind 
blowing through the 
leaves of the trees.

...

I wanted to tell you something, but I never had the chance to do so because I was driven off by some, well, I was driven off by the lady at the bar who told me that she was going to have to ask me to leave. She told me that she was going to have to ask me to leave, and I'm not sure why, I think that the issue was that my nails were dirty, and I think that the issue was that the brunette was there, yeah, that one, but who knows, who knows? Nobody knows because no one knows who the brunette is? she is someone that nobody knows because her identity was reduced to something other than what it used to be the other day. She has a new name. It was funny seeing that Gordo's Barbecue was shut down. I liked that place.

...

Why do I keep looking at
the very reason that I
ever got started

Why.
why do I keep looking?
an idea? a reason?
a thought?
what?

how do I express what.
how do I put this into
words? 

maybe the answer is never!
and maybe that's the way it
goes! anyway.

in other news: personal news
of course! i'm thinking that i'll
just settle the tab and close out.
i mean. as far as school goes.

...

that was the way it happened. and I'm not really feeling all that great about it.

I'm ultra-tired. I have two more days of the work week, but I'm tired. Well. I'm not really tired, it's just that I haven't fallen asleep since I came back from work. I can't take time-off, I can't take time off in general, but especially between now and April. I basically have my year planned out: nothing interesting between now and April, then from April to August still nothing interesting, then it's winter. It's 2023, and this is the one-millionth time I've had to put things back together after everything fell apart.

...

I'm thinking mainly about April. This is one of those cases where I'm anticipating coming in slightly short of my goal, but it does seem possible that I might make it if I squeeze, and maybe get a little lucky.

...

In terms of my finances. The main thing is getting through until April. Tax season. Then I have to focus on paying off my credit cards. I'm not sure how long that will take. There hasn't been much overtime lately, and honestly, there have been several times when I've wanted to take time off but didn't because I kind of can't really afford to.

Lean times.

I don't anticipate getting a tax refund. During the months I wasn't working in 2022 I was basically running on my IRA money, and I'm sure I'm looking at a fat penalty. Nightmare.

...

Repayment on my student loans begins in April. Nightmare.

...

I want to take a few things to the thrift store donation center. I've been meaning to do this, but I just haven't gotten around to it.

...

Someone I used to work with at the tractor warehouse died. He died about a year and a half ago. I looked him up online, but I couldn't find a cause of death or anything, only that he died at the hospital. It seems that he was working at a car dealership in town at the time.

I wasn't really thinking about him or anything, it's just that I was looking through my old Facebook memories and I came across a post with a few likes from my old co-workers from the tractor warehouse, and then came across a post mentioning his death about a year ago, and then I did a web search and came across his obituary.

...

About a week ago I went to Lee's Sandwiches to get a Banh Mi sandwich. I ended up ordering and eating three of them. The location is half an hour away from where I live, so, even though there have been other times when I've wanted to eat one, I simply didn't do it because it would be an hour in driving time to get a sandwich.

...

I bought my new computer primarily to play Victoria 3, but I really haven't gotten around to buying Victoria 3 or even playing it. Most of the time I've spent playing on my new computer I've spent playing Civilization 6. 

...

I'm worried about the future. I anticipate that my budget is going to be extremely tight through April, and then continue to be extremely tight after that while I pay off my credit cards, and then find out if these student loans are going to be forgiven or not. I still have a credit card balance from the road trip I took to Louisiana back in February of 2022.

...

There are two things that I have to manage in my personal life, and they sometimes seem to be at odds. One is my energy levels, and the other is my mood. I try to elevate my mood by staying up after work and playing on the computer, but this reduces the amount of time I spend sleeping, but if I sleep for the full 11 or whatever hours of free time I have, then I seem to be grouchy, but if I'm tired, I also end up grouchy.

...

These last few weeks have been really long. Long hours each week. I did kind of want to take the day off when a notice for a VTO opportunity came up, but since I put in so many hours this week, I don't really want to take off an overtime day, a day that would be entirely overtime pay. 

...


I finally came around to buying a new laptop computer. I spent about 550. It's an Acer that I bought on Amazon. I wanted a new computer to play Victoria 3, but I have a whole bunch of games in my Steam library that I haven't played because whatever computer I had when I bought them wasn't powerful enough to play them.

I think that the last time I bought a computer that required some shopping was in 2016 when I was at the Littoral house, just before moving into Sonata's. I ruined it in 2018 at some point when I was in Missouri, I fucked up the keyboard, but the computer still worked, and then I bought a replacement a few years later, I think in 2020 just before leaving Missouri.

...

I bought this mango smoothie that I thought was just a regular bottle of juice and I was shocked that it was four dollars. It honestly wasn't worth four dollars in my opinion. There's this brand of juice products that I really like that I get used to buying back in Arlington. I think it's called Jumex, and their juices come in paperboard boxes.

...

I've taken time off here and there over the past few weeks, just a few hours before the end of the shift if I was feeling fabulously exhausted. My phone really doesn't seem to have a good connection anywhere I go around here, so I have trouble doing any blogging, but I really don't have anything interesting to update on. I really don't have anything going on.

Today is the last day of the work week for me.

...

I have today off, and I'm just getting regular stuff done, reviewing my finances, doing laundry, looking at my work schedule. I want to close a number of my accounts, but at the same time, I don't want to close them. The benefit is that I would be better able to manage my money if I had fewer accounts, and if I could consolidate and concentrate my positions, but, I really don't have a ton of money anyway.

...

I'm really fucking tired. I had to buy a new phone there other day because my previous phone broke, the battery just wouldn't charge up anymore. This is probably the first phone I've ever replaced for this reason. I don't know why I'm tired. Well, I do know why I'm tired: I didn't get much sleep. I went to sleep as soon as I got home, and I felt fully rested as soon as I woke up a few hours later, but I didn't go back to sleep, so I'm running on maybe 3 hours of rest.

...

I want to buy a new laptop. Well, I don't really want to buy a new laptop, what I really want is to play a new computer game: Victoria 3, but I would need a new laptop in order to play Victoria 3. This is another thing that reminds me of the last time I was in Las Vegas four years ago: I wanted to play Grand Theft Auto 5, and I remember needing a new laptop. I didn't buy a new laptop. I bought a console instead.

...

it's the start of another work week. a few hours ago i really felt like putting in time off. i dont have enough for a full shift, but i could have put in a few hours, but right now im doing okay.

...

I went to the Nevada DMV and completed my Nevada Driver's License Request and Vehicle Registration. There was some kind of confusion at the appointments desk where the clerk wasn't sure if I had the correct documents to complete my Vehicle Registration, but the clerk that actually handled the paperwork was ultimately able to process my Vehicle Registration for Nevada.

There was also a kind of question about personalized / vanity plates, and nothing that I wanted was available. I really just wanted 33507, this is supposed to be LOSEE, but I guess it wasn't available or something. There were about 9 other plate numbers I had, but none of them were available.

The Nevada DMV had me surrender my Texas License Plates. The Texas DMV said I could just keep them, but, I guess I had to surrender them.

I ended up taking the night off from work. I was really tired. I think that I got home from the DMV at around 2 PM, and I felt like I power napped because I was kind of ready to head out to work at 6 PM like I usually do, but, for whatever reason I took the night off.

I really don't know what to do about this whole. Nevada. Thing. I continue to run through the last few months I spent in Texas in my mind, and I really can't pinpoint why things happened the way they did, why things turned out the way they did, but I could swear that everything was just going straight to hell for me there, as though I had no other choice but to get out of there. It just wasn't going well, I don't know what else to say, but then again, I'm not sure Texas was really ever easy to begin with.

...

About my breakfast at the Cannery the other morning: the style of the fish and chips reminded me of this one place I used to go to in Sunnyvale, California on El Camino Real. Someone once clarified different styles to me before, but just two, and this style isn't like either style. I don't really remember. I have to look this up and write it down.

...

I went to the Cannery Casino this morning to have breakfast. I went here a few days back really early in the morning, I want to say 2:00 AM or something in the morning, and none of the restaurants at the Cannery were open, but the Victory Café was open this morning when I went. I ordered Fish & Chips and a soda, and I spent 28 dollars, which is more than I really wanted to spend, given my current financial picture.

I was originally on my way to the Golden Corral, but I figured I'd check out the Cannery, since I tried to go there last time, but it wasn't open.

I have the hiccups really bad right now.

I have a new spreadsheet. I remember the one that I made when I first came to Vegas in 2018, There were several revisions over the years. The current one I use is focused mainly on totaling my assets, and my liabilities (debts) and I have an emphasis on paying down my credit cards. In 2018 I was focusing on planning out each individual paycheck, and throwing whatever was left into the stock market.

I bought socks and a belt.

...

i was craving sun chips earlier, so i went to the grocery store and bought some. they don't seem to be a whole lot less expensive at the grocery store than they are at the cafeteria.

...

I don't really know what to do right now. I'm bored. I was hungry, but I'm not hungry any more. I'm working on my budget on an off, here and there. I have one unusual expense, unusual in the sense that it's a sporadic expense, and it's the driver's license and vehicle registration expense that I'll experience next week.

...

Last day of the work week. I'm trying to think about what to do with my days off.

...

Well, sometimes I think that I haven't accomplished anything, but, maybe it depends on how I look at it. I did register a web domain. I registered a business name, and I registered several copyrights. I went on several road trips.

...

I'm still not really enthusiastic about being back in Las Vegas. I'm unhappy about it. I'm glad I got back in touch with my mom; I haven't really talked to her since I left four years ago, and I'm happy that I'm working again, but I really can't stand being back in Las Vegas. Simply being in Las Vegas is this constant reminder that I haven't really accomplished anything since I fucking left. Nightmare.

...

I still feel like I have way too much stuff. I've gotten rid of most of the stuff I do. Well. Actually. What I mean is. I got rid of quite a bit of stuff that I don't need, but I still have a lot of stuff that I don't really need.

Dress shirts. I haven't needed dress shirts in a long time. But they're not really dressy. so I'm not sure that their dress shirts. I just don't anticipate needing them.

There are other things that I have that I don't really want to throw away, and I really don't want to give away either. but I don't really need them. and I don't really anticipate needing them.

today is the first day of the work week. i had three days off, and I'm trying to think about what i got done during those days off. did i accomplish anything?

...

There's this idea that keeps running through my head over and over again, and, I'm not sure what to do about it.

...

I'm hungry. I went to the gas station around 10 PM and bought a few hot dogs to eat, and I think I bought wings as well, but I'm still hungry, or, rather, right now it's 4 AM in the morning, and I've become hungry again. I'm thinking about how to approach the next year, and, I really just feel like this is going to be a long period, maybe not a long period, but a period of my life where nothing exciting happens. Nothing really exciting ever happens, and I almost want to say that nothing exciting has happened in the four years since I left Las Vegas, I did put together a bunch of money during that time, and that's about as exciting as things went. I just really don't know how to make the best of this return to Las Vegas.

...

There are kind of a few things on my mind right now. I'm optimistic about the future, but I'm also kind of distressed about the future at the same time; or I feel something like, something between feeling distressed and overwhelmed. Sometimes the feeling oscillates between feelings of optimism and distress.

It's November. I don't really know what to think about that. About it being November already.

...

I was thinking about heading out of town, out of the state and picking up a lottery ticket. Sometimes I just feel like. Sometimes I just get excited about the thought of winning the lottery, the Powerball or the Mega Millions jackpot, but, sometimes I think the reason I feel this way is because at one moment or another I might feel like there's just really nothing interesting going on in my life at the moment.

I closed my Cash App, Venmo, and PayPal accounts. I just don't really use them that often any more, and I figured it's better just to close them, and reopen them if I need to use them later in the future. One thing I would hate is for something to happen with those accounts, and have to deal with a huge problem for an account I don't really use, and like I mentioned, I could always reopen accounts with them if I find a use for their services again.

...

There was this feeling I had earlier, like I really felt like hitting the road and going somewhere.

...

I think that I'll work on something right now.

...

What am I thinking about right now? Well, I'm not really thinking much of anything. I got an oil change, and I ended up getting my transmission fluid changed as well. I still want to get my tires changed, but I don't really know how soon I need to do that. I could probably wait until I hit 60,000 miles on my odometer, and that's still a kind of conservative timeline to seek a tire change. The treads look fine.

...

Word Salad

This is where the admittance
starts and I have to tell you:

I never really liked her, she
was just the finest, most beautiful

woman I had ever seen up until
then, and have ever seen since.

There she was: eating leafy greens
out of a container full of leafy greens

and in that moment I thought:
She is the most beautiful woman

I've ever seen.

Remember that there are a number
of ways to protect the information

inside your brain: try not to use a
tin foil hat that fails to match your

hair color or skin tone because it will
be obvious to everyone around you

that you're wearing a
tin foil hat!

The Response

You're an idiot!
I'm mad at you and
I'm not sure I'll ever

get over how irritated I
am with you, maybe
in a million years!

Maybe Longer! Who 
Knows! YOU MIGHT
NEVER BE FORGIVEN!

Why am I so. Why am I. So.
I. I don't know what this is but
sometimes I just feel so unhappy.

and I really just
don't want to say why.
I really don't want to go into
details because I feel so silly
about why I feel so unhappy.

You're a liar.
and you know it.
a real liar and I
really don't like
you! LIAR!

come on give me a break.
I don't do it maliciously!

there are times when
i still really can't get
her out of my head.
in many ways i'm really
fucking sick of it. you
know. that i still think
about her.

I'm sick of it. I really am.
frustrations and struggles

I would like things in life
to be easier and I would like
to get more of the things I want.

Something interesting came in the mail today; it was marketing mail for business checking accounts from Citibank and US Bank, and they were addressed to Chestnut & Hazel. I wouldn't mind setting up business checking accounts for Chestnut + Hazel, but I really don't have any steady income from Chestnut + Hazel yet.

I made an effort set up an account to self publish a book. It would be the Chestnut Street series. I have to take a look at it and see what changes I would make to the text.

It's midnight. I'm hungry, and I don't know where to go to eat.

I went to the Cannery Casino to eat at the Victory Cafe, but it wasn't open. Google Maps said it was open 24 Hrs, but I guess that wasn't accurate, so I ended up at Bourbon Street Bar and Grill. I had wings, but I wasn't too excited about them, they just seemed excessively battered, but I was really hungry and I'm really not sure what other options I had.

Sometimes when I go out to eat I get the feeling that the food was microwaved after being pulled out of a bag from something I could have purchased from the frozen food section of the grocery store.

I went and got an oil change, which was something I've been meaning to do for a while, and when I was getting the oil change, the technician recommended that I get my transmission fluid changed, so I did that as well. I really don't want to spend more than I need to right now, but I know that I've put a hell of a lot of miles on my car over the last few months, so I need to weigh being cautious with my spending against the risks of unexpected car problems from skipping on maintenance now.

...

I have to think. I was thinking about pursuing a graduate certificate in Spanish Translation at UNLV. One issue is that out-of-state tuition would make this cost prohibitive, but it's possible that my time in Nevada during 2018 would count toward my status as a Nevada resident, this is something I have to look into, and I'd probably have to request records from the Nevada DMV.

That UTA thing was a total disaster. I'm trying to squeeze as much out of the experience as I can by going through the course material, but. Yeah, that was a real interesting way to flush $3,500 down the toilet.

I need to explore as many programs at as many universities as I can. I really would prefer an in-person program rather than something remote, or online. I'm still kind of hesitant to look at anything. I'm hesitant to pursue a different graduate program unless I know that it will be the right fit for me. I don't know if there is any possibility of heading back to Texas for one semester, and just taking two classes or whatever, but, who knows.

...

I really want to buy new pants, and a new belt, but I also really want to hold off on doing either, and yet, even though I really want to keep my spending as low as possible, I went out to eat earlier today and I went out for drinks the other day. I went out for drinks the other night, and it was supposed to be a kind of date, but, we didn't end up meeting up. I went to the place she wanted to meet up at, but she wasn't there. I waited for about an hour, and then went home, and like five minutes after I was on my way home, she said she was there, and that I should turn around and come back.

That was discouraging, so I'm going to take a break from online dating. This is the second time I deleted, second or maybe third time I've deleted a dating profile in the last month. I switched accounts for some of my autopay expenses, and I'm kind of just waiting until the switch over becomes active.

...

Queen of the Goths

she's cute, 
and. 
she's kind of talking to herself, 
and. 
it seems like a very 
engaging conversation,
but 
maybe she's singing,
and
she doesn't have a headset on,
so
she's either singing
from memory
or
talking to herself.

...

I settled the account with UTA. That was a fucking pain in the ass. I don't know how many times I've gone over this situation on my blog, but I'll go over it again. I was originally awarded 10500 in student loans, but after withdrawing from the MSQF program, that amount was reduced to about 8500, these are all rough numbers but they're close enough, anyway, I was asked to return 2000 dollars to the University, UTA, and I just remitted the payment of 2000 bucks a few minutes ago. Headache. I really wasn't prepared for this. Anyway. I was really going to put this whole ordeal off for a while, but when I looked into my student loan account, or the account that services my student loans, I noticed that they adjusted the student loan amount from 10500 to 8500, so I figured since the issue that I was worried about most has been fixed, then I guess I'm comfortable settling the balance with UTA. The issue that I was afraid of was paying twice, so to speak, but if the loan servicer adjusted the amount due, then there is no need to worry about paying twice, and that's why I figured I'd settle the tab at UTA.

...

The other day I was thinking that it's really nice to be tired because it's really nice to fall asleep as a result of being tired, rather than falling asleep because I have nothing better to do.

I want to go into the details about the issues I'm facing in terms of UTA and the DOE student loans and all the nonsense I have to deal with. I'm just finding it difficult to explain. I'm pissed about the way things turned out this first semester, but I'm not totally burned to the point of being completely deterred from going to graduate school.

There are certain things that I need right now, but that I can hold off on. I need an oil change, and tires. she's cute, and. she's kind of talking to herself. and it seems like a very engaging conversation. maybe she's singing.

I'm kind of tired. There was an opportunity to sign up for overtime after the end of my shift this morning, so I signed up. In a way I kind of want to take it easy, but really, the best thing to do is take any overtime that I can get and get my finances back in order. I'm sure there will be time to relax later. I think about how I kind of didn't really do anything for the last several months, and I think that if I could have done things differently, I would have done nothing in a way that would be more enjoyable.

...

I was so tired toward the end of my shift last night. I haven't worked in five months or so, and I guess my body just needs to get back into the rhythm of working again. At the end of my shift I went to the gas station to get food, and I was just shocked with how expensive it was. I had three hot dogs and a soda refill, and I guess I won't be going to that gas station again, for breakfast anyway. I still might need gas, and who knows when or where I'll need gas. I'm sure that my life is going to get on track again, but this is going to be a long journey back to, you know, where ever the hell I was financially. I think about those times after a natural disaster when people rebuild their towns and homes and cities, and I think about my life and how I'm rebuilding my life after this disaster that happened over the last few months of my life. Disaster. Rebuild. Grow. Live. Disaster. Rebuild. Grow. Live.

I'm thinking about something, and this something is stressing me out right now.

I'm at work, and my mobile service provided doesn't really have much of a connection in this part of town.

This is where

the pot of gold is
and this is where
leprechauns hang
out and here you
can tell me what

you are looking for in terms of
gold and silver and there was nothing
there for anyone to do and there was
nothing interesting that may have been
there and you can see what the end of
the taste is and you can sense what
you continue to feel. why do you feel
that way? ask yourself and you will
come up with an answer, but it might
or it might not be the right answer.

I really want to buy 
some new clothes 
right now, but I just 
don't need any.

and I don't know if this is the
kind of thing that I should do
anyway to elevate my mood.

I think that there are times when
I skimp on simple pleasures, only
to really obliterate my money on
other things that I really do not
enjoy or appreciate or even really
want to spend any of my money on.

...

Outside it sounds like
it's raining, but when I
go outside it turns out
that it's not raining. It's
just the wind blowing
through the leave of
the trees, and the sound
that this process makes
resembles the sound of
rain. That's what it was.
It wasn't butter melting
on a stove nor was it rain.
it was just the wind 
blowing through the 
leaves of the trees.

...

I wanted to tell you something, but I never had the chance to do so because I was driven off by some, well, I was driven off by the lady at the bar who told me that she was going to have to ask me to leave. She told me that she was going to have to ask me to leave, and I'm not sure why, I think that the issue was that my nails were dirty, and I think that the issue was that the brunette was there, yeah, that one, but who knows, who knows? Nobody knows because no one knows who the brunette is? she is someone that nobody knows because her identity was reduced to something other than what it used to be the other day. She has a new name. It was funny seeing that Gordo's Barbecue was shut down. I liked that place.

...

Why do I keep looking at
the very reason that I
ever got started

Why.
why do I keep looking?
an idea? a reason?
a thought?
what?

how do I express what.
how do I put this into
words? 

maybe the answer is never!
and maybe that's the way it
goes! anyway.

in other news: personal news
of course! i'm thinking that i'll
just settle the tab and close out.
i mean. as far as school goes.

...

that was the way it happened. and I'm not really feeling all that great about it.

I was thinking back to my February 2022 to Louisiana road trip, and how, shortly after returning to Dallas-Fort Worth I came across an older blog post of mine with a crude sketch of a planned road trip to Louisiana I ended up going in the opposite direction. I planned on heading to San Antonio, then New Orleans, then Shreveport, then back to Dallas. Instead I went to Shreveport, New Orleans, San Antonio, then Dallas.

Somewhere in the back of my mind the idea of driving to Alaska something I still think about. This isn't something that I can do any time soon. I have to get through tax season, and then pay off all of my credit cards, which will take me through July 2023, at the absolute soonest.

...


























...

I was trying to think back to when I came back to Las Vegas, and it was early October. During my road trips I started smoking cigarettes again because it's easier to do so while driving, but it's expensive, so I switched back. I started making my own cigarettes again, and adding ground cloves to the tobacco. I came across clove cigars on my road trips, and I remembered smoking them back when I was at Evergreen, but I never really smoked them with any regularity.

I continue to feel really tired, but less moody than I have been over the last few months. I've been wearing earplugs at work.

...

I got my tires replaced. I'm tired. I was at the repair place for 4 hours.

...

I'm not too frustrated or stressed about having to change my tires because I've been planning on getting new ones, especially after all those months of road trips, but I was really hoping to put it off until August. This is 6 months early, and it really sucks because this is really not the best time.

...

I got a flat tire while going to the grocery store. This really throws off my plans for, you know, my plans through mid-April. I was hoping to hold off on getting new tires until June. This is way earlier than I was hoping. Anyway, the place didn't have my tire size in stock, so they're ordering them, and they'll be in on Monday, so in the meantime I'll be on my spare tire.

I like having a three day weekend. There was something I was thinking about just five seconds ago, and it just slipped my mind, but it came back to me just now. I wanted to mention that I played Rome Total War 2 today. I hadn't played it in such a long time.

I'm reading some of my Facebook Memories from over a decade ago, from 11 years ago, and some of them aren't publicly visible. They're posts that I've written to myself. I used Facebook as a kind of diary.

...

My work shoes arrived the other day. I think they look nice. I ordered sneakers; I haven't bought boots in a while.

I selected a mesh fabric, which is important because my feet get really sweaty.

...

I've been wanting to go somewhere for a while, but, I really haven't thought about where, or what I would do there. Salt Lake City has been on my mind, but, I really don't know what I would do, or if I would enjoy it.

Just looking at what a drive would be, it would be cheaper to fly there, but I wouldn't have my car.

I went to the buffet, had dinner. I guess I shouldn't be super discouraged or anything, but I'm definitely frustrated. I'm less frustrated than I was earlier, but, still frustrated.

I guess I kind of made 3.50, when I look at the cost basis of the shares I bought today against the shares I sold.

But, today was just so agonizing that I don't want to do it again. When I think back about how the trading day when, there was a point where I could have bought back in at 19.08, and that would have meant that I ended the day with the same number of shares that I started with, and made a profit, but, for some reason I didn't buy back in, I think that, at the time, I thought that I had to buy back in at 19.06 or less, so I was holding out, but then the share price rose to the point where buying back in was more or less hopeless, and then out of frustration I sold everything, and in retrospect I shouldn't have done that either because, I could have sold those shares for slightly more than I sold them for.

I'm not completely done with day trading, or active investing, or active trading, it's just that I think that I need to re-work my approach. I don't want to buy back into VFC and try again. I'll just do something else, but, yeah, that was a real headache.

...

I experienced a moment of very intense frustration earlier. Maybe tomorrow will be a better day. I almost thought about taking off to Salt Lake City, but, then I thought never mind. I don't like going into details, but I guess I will. I've had a hard time with my position in VFC stock. Disaster. I entered a position back in February, and it's done nothing but crater ever since. I kept doubling down for a few months, and it continued to drop, so, I had to re-strategize. My goal was to reduce my position size slowly by buying a few shares, and selling that new position with a fraction more with each sell. I'd buy 5.95 shares and sell 6.00, and do that throughout the day. 

Then I ran into a problem, Cash Accounts aren't subject to the Pattern Day Trade rule the same way that Margin Accounts are, but Cash Accounts are still subject to a kind of Good Faith Violations rule, or a settled cash rule, and this turned out to be a pain in the neck. The number of round trips I can make in a day isn't fixed, but it's still limited buy the settlement of the purchase of shares, and the proceeds of any sell of shares.

At some point I realized that I could actually do things in the opposite direction as well, sell 6.00 shares, and buy 5.95 shares afterward, and the effect would be the same, or similar, and I would do this as the share price fell. I ended up selling more shares than I wanted to, and the opposite happens when I do things the other way around, I end up with more shares than I want to hold onto when I buy and sell, and I end up selling more shares than I want to when I sell, and then buy.

In a bout of frustration I ended up selling all my shares, and when I thought about buying back in, I thought: fuck this, I'm out of it, and, you know, do I really want to go back in on something that has caused me such intense frustration? The answer is no. So you know, I guess that's over.

It really made me think about how so many things in my life just don't seem to work out for me. So many fucking things just don't seem to work out for me.

Well, I guess I didn't lose a huge amount of money, but I'm more or less done with day trading for the time being.

...

Success just seems to be so elusive for me, whether it's success in the workplace, or, with investing, or, with artistic pursuits, or, educationally, or, with sexual and romantic pursuits.

I'd like to come up with a list of all the things I've given up on, the things I've lost interest in.

...

Why can't I just win for once? This is so irritating.

...

One of the things in life that I really hate, it that everything seems to be so much easier for everyone else. I'm having a hard time, and, nothing ever seems to get much easier.

...

I think about the things in life that elude me. Here we go. I never get anything that I want.

...

Oh, I actually do have something to say. Lint pills. They are a nightmare, I was using a cuticle cutter to remove them, but then I remembered how I used to deal with this: by using a razor blade, the kind of shaving, a Bic razor blade. It works like a charm. I found an old kitchen knife that I used for removing lint pills from my pants, I bought the kitchen knife back when I was living in Arlington, but, when I found it, it was rusty. I was surprised that it was rusty because the knife was a stainless steel knife, but, whatever, it was rusty, so I threw it in the recycling bin.

...

Anyway. I don't really know what to say right now.

I must have been semi-serious about going because I packed my laptop. There were several times where I would go on a road-trip with nothing more than I would ordinarily carry: my wallet and phone, and that's it, not even an extra change of clothes. Serious.

One of the pictures I came across was a screenshot of my phone with the destination set to Las Vegas, it was from shortly after I left Cameron, Missouri and was staying the the Dallas - Fort Worth area, I hadn't taken up residence in Texas or anything at the time, I was just there I guess, staying at motels or whatever. At some point I remember thinking: fuck it, I'll just head back to Vegas, but on my way there I started having issues with my car, my car would shake if I went over 60 MPH. I ended up staying in Texas as a result.

I didn't get it fixed until a year later, and it turned out to be something cheap: my tires just needed to be balanced. It's not that I was trying to avoid the cost of getting it fixed at the time, or, maybe it was, or I don't really know. I do remember that I took it as a sign to just stick around. Azle, Texas is on the western edge of the Dallas - Fort Worth area, so I must have been heading to Vegas and stopped there.

Years later, when I got stuck in Jennings, Louisiana, I remember almost thinking that I should stay there. It was a small rural town and I remember having. I remember feeling nostalgic about living in Cameron, Missouri. I don't know why I decided against staying in Jennings, Louisiana. I remember not having my computer, and I'm thinking that I just wasn't able to look into apartments and jobs in the area. I remember, I eventually rented a U-Haul truck and a tow dolly and towed my car back into Dallas - Fort Worth.

I just went to the buffet and came back. Part of the reason I went was to get a fortune cookie, more than anything like being really hungry.  

The fortune cookie said: hidden reservoirs of strength are about to be discovered.

and I don't really know what to think about that. I don't need any trials and tribulations and shit right now that show me just how much strength and perseverance I really have.

I would prefer it has something to do with making a, you know, soul mate connection and, you know, I have all these reservoirs. of. you know. strength. hehe.

...

I'm feeling somewhat scatter brained right now. It's not like I've had a whole bunch of caffeine or anything, so I'm not sure why my thoughts are all over the place.

One thing I'm thinking about is that I've had since mid-April to pay off my credit cards, and, I should be able to pay them off by the end of August like I originally planned, and also, my thinking is that I actually can pay them off by the end of August.

...

So, at the beginning of the year I thought that I would only need until the end of August to pay off my credit cards, but it turns out that I would only be half way there by the end of August, and that's under somewhat ideal circumstances, what that means is that I'll probably be working on this until the end of the year, and fuck, student loan payments start in August. at the end of August, and that's just going to be another drag.

...

I ate around 3/3 of the pizza roll snacks in the back, and I'm kind of stomach sick, I was really hungry, but, I ate too much.

...

I went to the grocery store to get pizza snack roles, not Totino's, but the generic store brand version, which had more rolls at a lower price, Well, obviously, but I think they had 30 percent more rolls, and were 25 percent lower in price.

...

So yesterday, after I threw the towel in on day trading my way out of a loss in VFC stock, I figured I'd just stay in cash or something for a while, then I thought, maybe I shouldn't get so discouraged or whatever. For some reason I thought: maybe I'll just throw it all back into an index fund, but with my luck something catastrophic will happen anyway: another pandemic, a global catastrophe, an asteroid hits earth, nukes start detonating in major cities around the world, some AI program starts generating content that precipitates civil unrest, or uprisings, or radicalizes fringe groups, famine, volcanoes, earthquakes.

What is. the next black swan event? What happens next?

I'm so frustrated that everything I seem to try, with everything I seem to try, nothing really seems to work out, or, nothing seems to improve things for me. Well, things in life have improved, but, some real big improvement in my life just hasn't materialized.

...

I'm bored. I don't know what to do, but at the same time, I don't really want to do anything.

Sometimes I get lost in my thoughts. mostly about the long series of disappointments and setbacks I've faced during my life. I'm almost ready to try again. or try something new. I don't really know what to try my hand at though.

I don't
really
know
what to 
try
though.
I really don't.

I think of there being three things. three possibilities, some kind of educational pursuit, some kind of technical training, and some kind of second job or side hustle. I'm still really resentful about how things turned out for me at UT Arlington. Really angry. Furious.

...

Today is the first day of the work week. I work nights, so I still have several hours before I have to go in. I read emails, I'm doing laundry right now. is there anything else I can really do?

...

Today is the last day of the weekend.

Looking back at this mini road trip. I really wish I had taken more pictures of Ely, NV. The part of the town that isn't totally brand new has a really distinct look to it.

...

I went on a road trip. A super tiny one, much less ambitious than I had originally planned, but it still felt longer than I wanted, and yet, I also spent so much time on the road that it isn't clear to me why I didn't reach my goal.

My original goal was Las Vegas, NV to Elko, NV to Salt Lake City, UT to Saint George, UT to Las Vegas, NV, but that didn't happen.

Early on in the trip I changed my goal from Elko to West Wendover, NV, figuring it would be a shorter trip between West Wendover to Salt Lake City, and also figuring that I might see the Mormon Crickets in West Wendover anyway.

Didn't happen. I got tired around Ely, NV, and then figured that's enough. I spent maybe 14 hours on the road. So yeah, that's really enough driving for me.

A few days ago I came across old posts from road trips that I had taken in the past, and I realized that so many of them coincided with difficult times in my life, and I kind of wondered if maybe difficult times in my life present themselves because I need to get out of the house or something, and also remembering that I almost went on a road trip the other day out of frustration.

Like, maybe the Universe itself is telling me I can't stay in bed and sleep all day, or play computer games.

I figured I'd go on a road trip without the Universe forcing me to do so.

The other kind of motivating factor was that I saw an overtime sign up. I missed it, obviously, otherwise I wouldn't have gone on a road trip, but it made me somewhat optimistic that I could go on a road trip without the cost of doing so effecting the deadline I'd set for myself to pay off my credit cards.

I recently transferred to a new work location, and I wasn't really expecting overtime to be a thing at this new location.

...

Yeah, so I'm back home now, I did not see any Mormon Crickets. NOT A SINGLE MORMON CRICKET! AT ALL! I'M SO ANGRY!

I went to the buffet yesterday. I got a fortune cookie and I feel like fortune cookies are my, secondary of course, but almost a second primary reason for going to the buffet. I was disappointed with what it said because it didn't feel like it really meant anything to me. it said something like: an optimistic heart clears the path to victory. and I'm not even sure how that's relevant to me.

My work week isn't that long. I work four days a week. nights.

It's Thursday, almost midnight, and I didn't do a damn thing with my day. I had a weird incident with my Steam gaming account where I had to change my password, which was irritating. but um. i love my new password. it makes my heart melt. haha. I guess I did a few things today, but nothing really material. I went to the grocery store and bought pizza rolls. I thought about going to a buffet, not the same one I go to all the time, the one just down the street, but I thought about going to one somewhere in Las Vegas, somewhere on the strip, or in Chinatown or somewhere, I don't know.

I usually delete emails as soon as I read them, but I was letting my email inbox kind of fill up because there were a few things that I wanted to read in-depth, most of these are newsletters, and some are kind of marketing emails, but I kind of wanted to catch up on things. So many things are distractions, and kind of useless.

Facebook memories. I saw this video of me walking to work back when I was living in Cameron, Missouri. One thing that's funny, not really related to the video or anything, but kind of because I was walking to work and I worked at a hotel, one of the things that is funny is that considering how long I worked at a hotel, that sometimes during my road trips I would try to get a room kind of early in the morning, and check-in is usually sometime later in the early afternoon, and, I would usually try to get a room early in the morning because I would be driving through the night, then I'd be tired in the morning. It's hot during the day, and I really don't like being out during the day doing anything.

Today is now Friday, and I should do something. Something useful. I don't really want to do anything like go out or whatever. I've become less interested in socializing. I've never been really into it anyway.

...

I have the rest of the day off, Thursday, and I have Friday off.

...

I left work a few hours early today. I was having issues with my computer, and after restarting the thing several times and logging in and out, and even switching computers, I realized that the issue was with my credentials or something, and not my computer. It's only ever me. So I went to Dotty's and had a few drinks and some bar food, then I went to the Cannery and had some more food. Then I went home and napped, I got back home at around the time I would have normally gotten home had I not left early.

Going out of town is sort of out of the question, I mean, at least today anyway. I signed up for a half shift for midnight Thursday, and I'm somewhat irritated because I left 2 hours early, and I signed up for a half shift, which if 5 hours, or five and a half, and like, I'm really only getting ahead by 3 hours this week, and at the same time, I'm already behind by 2 hours. Like I'm already behind by 2 hours, and I'm only going to get ahead by 3 hours. Well, 4.5 hours since those are overtime hours.

I have to remember to look into some kind of educational program, technical training, or second job.

...

I don't really want to go anywhere. I can't really think of where to go. and I'm also not really sure what I would do. I'm still focusing on paying down my credit cards, but it wouldn't really break the bank to go somewhere. or do something.

Sometimes when I go out to eat I have this desire or something to eat something real, but sometimes it's clearly something from a bag from the frozen foods section of the grocery store.

...

Well, there were a few things. One is that I got my meningitis vaccine. Fucking expensive. Really fucking expensive. I paid out of pocket. Really fucking expensive. Jesus. I don't really know.

I paid out of pocket. This is from Sanford Street 401. I paid out of pocket because I don't think that I was working at the time. I was going back to college and this was. This was during the few months leading up going to UT Arlington.

How are you doing Kenneth?

Not well, everything is a catastrophe, I'm basically failing, like usual, and can't really seem to get it together.

Why are you failing, Kenneth? and why is everything a catastrophe?

It's your fault! in fact, I think that from now on, I'm going to think of you as katastrophiena! Anyway, hyperbole aside, I'm legitimately not doing well, things aren't too much of a catastrophe, but they are more or less a total disaster. I'm serious.

I'm amused.

Yeah, well, I don't really know what to do.

Why do you figure it out.

Yeah, that's probably not going to happen. I'm really never going to figure this out.

...

It's lunchtime, and I'm not hungry, and I don't know why. I'm just not hungry.

I missed a sign up for overtime this week, so I have 3 days off, but there is honestly nothing interesting that I can do with that time. My courses start soon, so preparing for that is about as interesting a thing as I can do with my days off.

...

There weren't any breakfast burritos available when I went to the gas station this morning, so I bought a soda and that was it.

...

I'm in the worst mood ever. I feel like garbage.

...

My phone still doesn't really have a good connection at my new work location. This is frustrating because sometimes I want to write or read while I'm in my car. I get almost no connection anywhere in North Las Vegas.

I bought cigarettes. Twice. After telling myself that I want to quit smoking. I don't know what to do. It was lunch, and the gas station is just around the corner. So I bought some.

I continue to struggle with bouts of really intense unhappiness. It comes and goes and I'm not always sure where it comes from. It's usually over things I shouldn't really be bothered by.

...

Well, I bought a pack of cigarettes. I didn't mean to do that, but after this pack of cigarettes, I will definitely stop smoking. Tomorrow, Saturday, is the last day of the pay period, but the first day of the work week, I have the rest of today off, and I don't go in until 6:00 PM tomorrow. I don't know what it is, but even when I drink soy milk I get a stomach reaction similar to when I drink regular milk. Like: "come on stomach, this is just soy milk!"

...

I have to stop smoking, and I want to stop smoking.

...

Sharing or posting pictures on Blogger isn't ideal. The issue has to do with sizing. I need to manually adjust the sizes of pictures I post here to 600 pixels otherwise they overflow out of the margins.

I really want to stop smoking. I can't figure out why I'm so fatigued, sluggish, and tired all the time, other than that I smoke, and that I'd probably be more fit if I wasn't smoking. 

...

It feels like it has been a long week so far. I know that I shouldn't wish my life away, wishing the weeks and days and hours would go by faster, but I'm really stuck for the time being. distractions. diversions. I can't think of anything, and then again, I don't really want to do anything.

...

I want to buy some jeans, but I really have more pants than I need, and I also have enough jeans as it is, I think. So I guess I'll think that one over. I don't know. Some of my pants are too long. The length of my pants usually isn't an issue when I wear boots, but sometimes I wear sneakers, so, sometimes my pants drag across the floor.

...

I feel a little better. It seems that as soon as I wrote down that I was feeling sad, the feeling sort of dissipated. I felt like leaving work early, but, the most intelligent thing to do is finish out my shifts in full this week. I'm amazed by how long this week has felt so far, I still have one more day left of the work week, and, not really because I signed up for over time.

The most intelligent thing I can do is not leave work early.

I've kind of made a breakthrough with paying down my credit cards, it's not a major one, but I'll be able to accomplish, a kind of, full churn of the balances while reducing my total outstanding balances. This isn't a major breakthrough, but it's a breakthrough, and, I think that I should be happy about that. There is this kind of strategy or tactic where, I focus my payments on a specific card, and concentrate my spending on a specific card, and kind of rotate spending and payments during the month.

I have work today, but only about half a shift. I'm somewhat glad. I was really tired.

...

I continue to experience this really intense feeling of unhappiness. I don't know what it is. It hasn't gone away.

...

I can't believe how hot it is.

...

Today is Monday, like Monday-Monday. A real Monday, but for me it's a Wednesday in terms of the workweek, and yet that's not really accurate because I signed up for overtime this week, and I don't exactly have a day off. I signed up for two half-shifts. I kind of had to fight to keep my job today, not exactly but kind of. I'm not exactly sure what I would do if I were on the job market again.

...

some person on reddit laments that the person's country is on fire again, but i can't determine if the person is from france or canada.

...

It feels like there is a hole in my chest, or, like a ball of lead. I'm not really happy and I'm not sure why. There isn't much going on. Everything is kind of boring right now because the major goal. The major focus I have right now is paying down my credit cards.

...

I deleted my Facebook Dating profile like a few hours after setting it up. I didn't really put much into it, so I don't really feel like it's much of a loss.

I don't feel like getting de-monetized, and I've also just filed another appeal, but, I'm just not looking for a relationship and I don't know how else to put it, most of the apps for that type of connection are totally bogus. so, i'm not really going to put any more effort into that.

...

some person on reddit laments that his country is on fire again, but i couldn't determine if the person was from france or canada.

...

I'm feeling unhappy right now, and I don't know what set this off. There's nothing really going on. I signed up for Facebook Dating. Again. But. I'm not really enthusiastic about trying this again for the nine millionth time. Dating is something that I've really just given up on. And the truth is. I'm not looking for a relationship.

...

It's so hot. I can't believe how hot it is. I read that there was a heat wave in Texas, but I looked up the temperature in Dallas, and it's 12 degrees lower, but then again, it's later in the day over there, so I guess that's not an accurate comparison. At 10PM Pacific the temperature will be lower here in Vegas too.

...

when you take 
it all together
and see how
it all adds up and
how none of it
makes sense when
you look at it from
the perspective of
a person who sees
the bigger picture

you'll notice something
that you didn't notice
the last time you took
a look at it and sense that.

and you might not take
what you see seriously
because it doesn't look real
and you can't see the best
of the worst of the very
most interesting and you
can't take it with you
if you see where things go.

maybe you see things
that you aren't sure you
wanted to see or you
find out things that you
did not want to find out. 

but that's sometimes
the way it goes.

maybe you dig
but don't find anything
maybe you search
and you don't find anything
maybe you look
and see nothing

i imagined you called me 
and asked me to coffee
i imagined nothing i'd rather do
than have coffee with you

when i see the future i don't
see anything all that amazing
nothing in the future
nothing that i can see 
about the future seems
all that exciting
well
maybe that's not true maybe
sometimes

sometimes i see things that are
kind of amazing. some of the things
are not amazing.

i haven't fallen asleep and i need
to get some rest
and i've been actively trying to
fall asleep and i haven't been
successful in doing so.
even in this small task i seem
to have failed.

i haven't shaved my head in a while
because the last time i did i ended
up with a lot of nicks and cuts
and subsequently a bunch of scabs
which if i didn't let them heal would
just become new nicks and cuts
so i just didn't shave.

i think sometimes it's a reason
but it's not really a great reason
but it's a reason and
i'm really tired of explaining
every reason for every action
for every reason for every decision

and what i want to ask you is
if you're still as beautiful
as you always will be
because some people never change

i think that i'm missing something
i feel like i'm missing something
i have to be missing something
because i know that i'm missing something,
but what is it? i don't have a clue!

scatter brained where
half of my brain and thoughts 
are here and the other half
are somewhere else
maybe one day i'll have
a whole bunch of cool stuff
and maybe I won't but maybe
there are things that do not make 
sense where the things are

i don't know where the best
of the things are that cause 
my phone
alarm to ring. time
to head to work.
time to wake up
time to get going.
here we are and
we will be there shortly.

staring at the computer
screen and nothing changes
things are the same now
as they were just a few seconds
ago there is no change
there is nothing new to 
discover.

...

I don't really write a lot unless I'm facing challenges in life, but if everything is normal, then there really isn't much to write about. I had breakfast, I had lunch, I had dinner, I did laundry, and so on.

...

I signed up for a technical training program through the educational benefits offered by my employer. I hope this works.

...

Actually, don't worry about it, do whatever you'd like to do.

...

You're setting yourself up for the same problems over and over because you're doing the same things over and over with the expectation of a different outcome.

...

You're setting yourself up for the same problems over and over because you're doing the same things over and over with the expectation of a different outcome.

...

I think it's this, and I'm trying to be both candid and tactful at the same time, and it's very difficult to be both simultaneously, but hell, I'll try it.

...

Uh, well, I think it's this, and stop me if you disagree or maybe don't stop me because you like hearing me talk, maybe you like the sound of my voice, listen.

...

Let me ask you this because maybe you need a reflective moment for once so here it is: why do you think things fall apart so easily for you?

I don't feel that great. I haven't felt sad for several days, but it seems to be coming back, and again, I have no idea where this feeling comes from. Unhappy.

...

 
I want to nap but I'm awake. I have work later today, and, I also have something else to do a few hours before work starts.

...

I'm looking at a post from over 2 years ago from the Sanford Street series. I was doing food delivery at the time to make some extra money even though I was making pretty decent money with all the extra overtime I was logging at the book factory. At the time I was delivering food through Uber Eats, I eventually got kicked off Uber Eats and starting delivering using Door Dash, I don't think that I would have switched unless, like in this case, I was forced to.

Uber Easts and Door Dash are very different. Uber Eats doesn't have, or didn't have zones like Door Dash, you could end up anywhere in Dallas - Fort Worth, and the area is huge, the trips tended to be longer in terms of milage as a result, and seemed, in turn, to pay more. I also felt like I got pinged more often for a delivery with Uber Eats than with Door Dash.

With Door Dash I had to select a zone, so I think I would select the zone near the book factory, but, that wasn't a really good zone because the only restaurants in the area were, I think a donut shop and a few fast food places, so I wouldn't really get pinged. Sometimes I would head home, and then select the zone near my home, but I lived in a low-income neighborhood and again, I just wouldn't get pinged very often.

Sometimes I'd sit in my car for 30 minutes before getting an order, then I'd get an order and it would take 30 minutes, and then at the end of the whole thing I'd get two dollars and fifty cents for all of that. The last time I did food delivery I got an order paying one dollar and seventy-five cents. I declined it and quit food delivery for good at that point. I think it was sometime in the last quarter of 2021 that I quit doing food delivery and just started looking for a second job to make extra money. I took a job at a gas station, but I was only there for a month, the position was more physically and mentally draining than I expected it to be. The pay was also substantially less than what was advertised, so I figured it wasn't worth it.

Letters from Sanford Street # 281 Posted by Chestnut + Hazel on Mar 8, 2021

I really want to buy some new clothes, new pants, new jackets, and new shirts, but this is definitely a want, and not a need. There is more or less nothing wrong with the clothes I have, and on top of that, I have plenty of new clothes in my closet that I haven't used yet, and there is nothing wrong with those new clothes either, I mean, what I'm wanting is new, new clothes.

Well, I actually did buy 5 new shirts yesterday, so I did buy new, new clothes. What I'm I thinking, though. Well. There weren't any calls for overtime at the book factory. There was one small one, but it filled before I could accept it. What I mean is, I usually take two 12 hours overtime shifts at the book factory, supposing that those don't come up, it means I have to make up that money doing food delivery, and food delivery is a much harder way to make up that money, I want to say that it takes about 20 hours of food delivery to make the same amount as 12 hours of overtime.

There are aspects to both, food delivery doesn't have withholding, but it does have expenses, overtime at the factory does have withholding, but it does not have expenses. Anyway, what I'm trying to get at is this, If I have to make up that money doing food delivery, I really don't want to spend that money. Food delivery money is really hard to earn, which makes it really hard to spend.

It's another early morning, and I thought about heading to Salt Lake City again. What's there? I have no idea. There's this thought that I might not be able to do it if I don't do it now. Or, you know, if I don't do it today. I have the technical training, the vocational training courses starting next week, and they go on until November, and there is always the possibility of overtime although I'm in a location where the workload would probably trail increased sales volume by a few weeks or a few months.

The next set of memories were from Texas, from my first few months there in Arlington. Screenshots of my Robinhood account and some other stuff. I closed that account and a bunch of others a while ago because it wasn't really necessary any more, and I didn't feel any need to have more than the ones that I kept.

One of the pairs of jeans that I bought is just plain white. They were already dirty by the time I got home and put them on, but they are very comfortable for some reason. I think that dyes can change how cotton fabrics feel, I'm not sure if there is a difference when it comes to synthetic fabrics.

Yeah, these jeans are really comfortable. I'm really surprised with how comfortable they are.

I bought two pairs of jeans, two pairs of pants. three shirts, two of which have shirt pockets, and two pairs of shoes.

...

I bought a shirt. It's kind of small. well. Actually. It is small, but it's smaller than I thought it would be.

...

Kenneth. write this down. Forget about salt lake city temporarily. Stay local for now. do some in-person shopping to get out and explore.

Sometimes I experience extreme mental fog.

How do you like your new credit card?

I didn't get it yet. It hasn't arrived yet. It's one of the nicer Citibank cards, and I've been wanting a nicer Citibank card for a while. I had a secured card there for, like 4 years I think, and, I'm looking forward to getting my security deposit back, it wasn't a big deposit or anything, I'm kind of annoyed, though, because even 4 years ago I thought I was past the whole security deposit crap. I put you down as a reference.

I saw that.

The Fidelity one would have been more ideal. I think, but it was just bad timing, I think I applied for the Fidelity one some time last month, early June, and didn't get approved, I was going to wait until July 31st, but, for some reason I didn't and I think that if I had waited until July 31st I would have been approved. My score jumped in kind of a noticeable way, but, I think that it had more to do with timing than any reduction in balances, the timing of my payments and the statement issue dates seems to have worked out in my favor.

...

The idea. the thought that I might be spending too much money is kind of on my mind, and then again, I also don't want to fall into miser mode and save all kinds of money, only to spend all kinds of money in one go in some kind of manic episode, or, lose a whole bunch of money buying coins or shares or whatever only to sell those things at a loss later.

and then again. when I really think about it. I don't really think that I spent too much money. Most of what I spent the other day was on clothes, and I haven't bought new clothes since last year. I didn't really need new clothes, really, but, I don't know, I realize that I kind of need to look presentable when I'm going out and doing things.

...

I spent too much damn money yesterday. Some of that stuff was for things that I was planning on buying anyway, like clothes and stuff. Well, I've been debating about it for a while, and I guess yesterday I made up my mind. The other stuff I spent money on yesterday, though, was actually unnecessary. I don't know why I did it, I guess I just felt like getting out.

...

This is a self-guided experience and it's at your discretion what pace you take through the exhibit. I did the entire thing twice: once to take pictures, and a second time to read all the placards to contextualize whatever I happened to be looking at. This place has a surprisingly eerie feeling considering it isn't deliberately designed to feel macabre. I'm going to see Christopher Nolan's new movie Oppenheimer later today, and I thought that this would be a suitable activity to accompany seeing the movie.

Additional cracks continue to appear on the screen of my phone.

...

Once one crack appears on the screen, more follow. I've only had this phone for 2 months, and now the countdown begins for when I have to replace it. If I could somehow hold out a year this wouldn't bother me so much, if at all, but, I just bought this damn phone. A few cracks in the corner, now all across the screen.

...

My phone screen just cracked. I just bought this damn thing.

Looking at my old posts. I bought this phone in early May. So I've only had this phone for 2 months. I don't really want to switch carriers and I don't really want a new number.

...

Kenneth, I want your trademark -ginity!

I really don't know who else I would give that to.

...

This felt like a long weekend, and that's a good thing. it a good thing for the weekend, for my days off to feel longer than shorter. I've been increasing my caffeine consumption, which is actually so. I've actually been trying to cut down on caffeine consumption.

...

I feeling almost sad right now. I'm not there, in the sad zone, but it feels like the sadness is about to hit. Like I'm about to be slammed in the chest with a blast of emptiness. I've felt better lately, whatever this feeling is, whatever causes it, seems to be abating, or something, but it still almost gets there.

...

I think that I wrote this poem back in 2017 for a creative writing class. I saw that it had several views. I'm not really sure how much I like it. I think that at the time, and for years before as well, my goal was just to pump out as many poems as I could in any given day, and this is kind of a product of  that.

Drinking Whiskey Is Like Kissing A Woman

After all the bars I've gone to, and all
the drinks I've had, I can say that drinking
whiskey is like kissing a woman. Fall
into a shot of whiskey while thinking

about a woman who you'd love to kiss
and you'll find it a more than adequate
substitute for bringing your tongue to bliss.
Not very many people would equate

A shot of whiskey to a kiss because
they have never tried it: I recommend
that they do. Longing for a kiss can cause
mental distress that's very hard to mend:

It's been written about in all kinds of
insane lunatic poems about love.

I am. In. Salt Lake City. Hehehe. Stupid. I don't know where to go. From here.

...

My phone is almost completely cracked, and, I'm probably going to need a new phone soon. Another issue is that I was written up at work for productivity, and this is kind of a headache. In the worst case scenario I'm out of a job in 2 - 3 weeks, so I have to prepare a contingency for that, and, you know, this is a little bit of a nightmare. I do what I can to stay employed, but, sometimes it seems the harder I try, the harder I have to try, and it feels like this is one of those time where Destiny & Fate are clearly trying to push me in a new direction, but not as hard as they sometimes do. When I left Las Vegas 5 years ago, and when I left Missouri 3 years ago, and when I left Texas 1 year ago, like each time it was just. It just really seemed that there was no way to triumph over whatever challenges I had been facing.

When I think about heading to Salt Lake City I'm in two minds about the idea. If I'm a few weeks away from being unemployed, then maybe doing a road trip isn't the best idea, and on the other hand, maybe I should go on a road trip because if I don't do it now, I might not get a chance to do a road trip for a while. Like, if I get canned, it will be maybe another year before I'm in a position to really do anything.

...





























It was funny because, when I saw him months later at a new company, I asked him what this issue was, why, you know he was at a new company and all that. For me, I was looking for a second job, but I already had a second job, and I think, most employers aren't too open to any given employee having two job and all that, at least, not for very long anyway. Anyway, about the old friend, I asked him what the issue was, and he said he said something, and I said to him, you know, it's funny that you should say that, because, I happened to be thinking the exact same thing.

Something like. I remember ordering something like 2 large appetizers, they were large enough for 2 people, and, for some reason the waitress asks if I want an entrée anyway. So I ordered one, but I was already really stuffed. I ate everything, but I really was super stuffed. I didn't know what to do. I was stuffed, like a turkey. I'm on thing ice right now. 2 write ups, and now I'm on suspension. I'm afraid about the potential for tough times ahead. I'm afraid about the future. I want to be at a point where I can say: everything turned out for the best.

There were times when things really did get better, and when it seemed like I was on the right path. sometimes it feels like a good future is so far away, and so far out of reach. and something that will just never happen. and something that will just never materialize. and something that is just for people who have connections, and something that is just for people who have all the right social skills. and sometimes I think that maybe I should make more friends. I made one friend, and we exchanged contact information. Sometimes friendships go stale by the time I need a letter of recommendation. sometimes connections drop by the time I need a letter of recommendation. 

Coincidences skill seem to pop up from time to time, and sometimes I'm not really sure what to make of them. Sometimes there is this thing or that thing and some connection between the two, and I don't really even want to go into details, I really don't even want to get into the specifics of this or that thing. I just don't. I really don't. When she says that coincidence makes sense only with you, what I wonder is does she mean the coincidence seems to make sense only when someone, whoever she is talking to, explains the coincidence as more than a coincidence, or does she mean, that the person who she is talking to is able to accept a coincidence as a coincidence without thinking more of it. two thirty two. ninety six. four four three. I'm probably just seeing things.

...

I'm really not feeling okay. I'm not feeling okay at all. Things are not going well. I was kind of making a little bit of progress not too long ago, but now, I think I'll be facing kind of a set back. Nightmare. over and over. I'm not happy. I'm unhappy. Everything is kind of a disaster. Everything is kind of a nightmare. The clock is officially ticking, and I have no idea what on earth to do. I feel like pure garbage.

...

I left work early. again. and again it wasn't really a good idea. not the end of the world. but not a good idea. I'm just not really feeling happy. I feel like pure garbage. I'm just in a persistent unhappy mood. With all the time I've missed I might as well have gone on another road trip. When I looked at my time card I didn't realize that I left so early. I thought I worked 2 hours at least, but, it was really only an hour an a half. I drink so many energy drinks every day. I don't know why I'm in such a bad mood all the time. I'm either angry, or depressed. over and over in circles.

Feeling lost. I have no idea what to do. I kind of want to go back to college. One of the few things that I enjoy is the Software and Web Development course that I'm taking, it's expensive, and I don't really think I'd be doing this unless it was an employer paid benefit, but I think I kind of want to check out what's offered at one of the community or junior colleges in Las Vegas.

So even if I'm somehow able to work through all my remaining shifts for the week, it will only put me at about 31 or 32 hours worked for the week. Huge mistake to cut out of work, but, sometimes my brain, my mood, just has to get away. I couldn't concentrate during class, and I'm having trouble concentrating now.

...

I left work early. That was a stupid decision, but, I'm in a really bad mood. I'm just in such a lousy mood. I went on a block rampage. I'm in such a bad mood. Really bad mood. I'm resentful about so many things. I'm unhappy, and angry, and frustrated, and irritated, and resentful. I don't know what to do about these feelings, or what's causing them. I think that I've been able to get The Complete Letters from Sanford Street to be compliant with the community standards. It took a while. A long while.

...

Chestnut and Hazel now has a LinkedIn page. Yeah. I didn't really do much with the Chestnut and Hazel Facebook page. I don't know how much other stuff I should set up for it. This is a lot of. stuff. I really. I'm really wanted to start to make something of Chestnut + Hazel, and I want it to be more than just a blog. I want to keep the blog, of course, but I want to make Chestnut & Hazel into something. I have a few ideas, but I'm really just not there yet.

The main idea I've come up with is a kind of travel guide. Or a road guide or something.

I'm experiencing real dread for the workday ahead. I can't believe that I'm already at a second write up in less than a month. On the one hand I've honestly been working here, at the same company, for longer than I've really work at any company, and, I'm honestly kind of interested in maybe doing something else but I'm just not really sure what that something else would be at this point.

I don't want to be in a desperate position in the event that I'm on the job market again. This is a nightmare. A real nightmare, and I'm really not ready to start looking again. 

When I think about the things I could possibly do, one of the things is working on chestnut + hazel more seriously, but like, there's still the very real issue of paying whatever living expenses I have to deal with. I really don't know what to do, and I don't know what I would do. I'm really dreading the moment where I hit GAME OVER. Real dread. I don't know what to do, or what to look for or how to approach things. The one thing is that, last time. The last few times I've applied for work, I didn't really have a hard time finding something.

Good lord. I got written up again. Write up number 2. I think that it was last Monday I was written up, then, I worked just a few hours on. Okay, so it was last Sunday that I was written up, I worked just a few hours on Monday, and then took off to Salt Lake City. Jeeze, I didn't even know I could get written up on the basis of four hours of under-performance.

...

Fourteen hours. That's how much time I put in this week. So today will put me at twenty-four. I had no idea I missed that much work. I feel a little bit like garbage. I need to think. I have to watch out as far as missing work goes. I have enough unpaid time available to use, but of course, not enough money.

...

Getting rid of accumulated junk. This and that. When I went on my road trip to Salt Lake City, I had some recyclables that I wanted to recycle, but, at some point I said: "forget about it" and threw it in the trash. Editing this massive Sanford Street post is taking a while. I'm doing it little by little, removing anything that might be offensive. I'm still not sure how any of this can be an issue, since it's all text, and I don't really linger on any particular topic for a huge percentage of any given post, so, I really don't know how this all got flagged.

Right now I don't even want to go into work. Maybe my mood will change, who knows. I have a few hours, and I should nap a little more.

Something just slipped my mind. I was just thinking about something, and whatever it was, it just slipped my mind. whatever it was. I think that I remember now. What I wanted to say is that I want to get back in to going to the movies on a regular basis, or seeing movies or whatever. I haven't seen any in a long time, and, yeah, I don't know. I don't know where to start. I did get a chance to see Oppenheimer, and that was basically it. I haven't really thought to keep up with what is going to be released and all of that.

...

Today is Saturday, and I have work later tonight. Class is over and I'm going to take a nap. I had a long weekend, especially considering that I took 2 days off, in retrospect that was somewhat silly, I could have done that later in the week, but, at the same time I was just really in a garbage mood, and I don't know, I really had to get out or something, or break away. This coming week is going to be kind of long.

...

The work week starts in just 2 hours. I have class, and then work later on in the day. I have to continue cleaning up the Complete Letters from Sanford Street, I figure that most of what I'm doing is cutting things out, and removing things, or whatever, that seems inappropriate, so, that's basically it.

Introduction

These are notes taken while living in Arlington, Texas on Sanford Street. I lived on Sanford Street from June 2020 to October 2022. This is currently in the process of being edited. These posts are a mix or journal entries, reflections and introspections, thoughts, stream of consciousness writings, and just a general mix of thoughts, worries, and plans for the future.

This is kind of annoying. I haven't 
really messed around with paper and ink
in such a long time: here I am, having
a total blast! This process really stinks:

First, write it up, then type, then print or post,
just another piece of shit thing to do
with time I have to flush down the toilet.
Quicker to snap, then upload to the host,
and then somehow this makes its way to you,
reading on your phone as you take a shit.

This is just another time in my life
where this is the only task for me to
pursue, and, filled with turmoil and strife
I tattoo these sheets of paper in blue.

Actually Writing Again
and it really isn't what I was hoping for it to be.
it is boring and I do not like it.

I went to jack in the box to get tacos again. this is something that i may have to do for a while. i need to keep my expenses low. i really do. nightmare. pain. i have to stop eating out at restaurants for the time being. i really want to sell or liquidate as much of my stuff as i can, but i'm not sure i will get around to it. what i think would be kind of a loss is throwing it away or giving it away like i did when i left Missouri. what i mean is. waiting to get rid of all my extra stuff until the absolute last minute, and not have the chance to recoup any money from it.

...

I go into work in just a few minutes. About the writing project. I have 2 ideas. Well. 3 maybe. 1 is a series of funny hypothetical experiences. 2 is a series of funny prospectus caricatures. 3 is a series just slice of life poems.

I've reviewed some of my old poems. And ive already done idea 3. It's probably the thing i write about most often. And most of the poems that i discarded and dont have any more. And couldnt track down were on that topic. Or of that style.

Somber music played by guys at the pool,
I'm listening from my sweltering room,
as the sun beats down, the water is cool,
I'd join them to alleviate my gloom.

I have this totally ridiculous 
thought that if I can't really sleep right now
then perhaps I should try to finish this
series of epic sonnets on the Dow

the Standard and Poor's, the Russell, and the 
Wilshire. Dumb old index crap, I'd like to
do something more sophisticated, a
person like me, though, consistently blue

in mood, testicles, temperament, and chips,
writing these sad songs with my hands and lips.

there are people
all around you and they say things
that you shouldn't hear.

I was thinking about this poem I wrote a while back. Maybe a few years ago. I was going through my Spam folder and I came across some Spam messages that I thought were funny. I have to go through the hella-zillions of posts that I put on this god dammed blog. Figure out what poems I like, and then submit them.

I don't think that I'll keep any poems unpublished for the time being. I think that i'll just post them as soon as I write them. There is no incentive for me to keep them unpublished unless there is some kind of. I don't even know.

I was going to complete some unemployment paperwork to collect payment on the few weeks that I wasn't working. But I'm not sure I will. I archived the letter they sent, and I'm just going to forget about it. This is somewhat horseshit. I don't know. I really don't know what I'm going to do about that.

Just totally irritated about it.

Asian beauties, Russian Beauties, and pills
to enlarge your penis, a lottery
check is waiting for you, and unpaid bills,
and deals on ancient Chinese pottery.

A handful of rice and a slice of spam
and a sheet of nori: wrap it around
and you have spam musubi, then you cram
it into your throat and swallow it down.

Spam is something that en masse you delete
because everything caught by the filter
is useless. Spam is something that you eat
unless your stomach feels out of kilter.

Spam is a nuisance, and also a food
one is deleted, the other is stewed.

and here
you are again
with your best friends eating

all the best
bacon and all the best
meats.

I was thinking about this poem I wrote a while back. 
Maybe a few years ago. I was going through my Spam folder and 
I came across some Spam messages that I thought were funny. I have 
to go through the jillions of posts that I put on this god dammed 
blog. Figure out what poems I like, and then submit them.

then you see where the people are and how they
do what they want to do.

I don't know if blogging and writing is a waste of time, or if it's just not very remunerative. Or if it's just that it hasn't been remunerative so far. In other words. I don't really get paid for this, and I really don't make any money doing it. Should I do it? Should anyone do anything that doesn't pay? I want to say that writing is a waste of time for me, but this is based on the premise that all time spent must be converted into money, and that the conversion of time into money is the be all and end all of how time is utilized.

I'm trying to get organized. I'm getting there. I am getting organized. It's a slow process, especially after the kind of mess that I've gotten myself into. Sticky fucking situations. How long will it take to clean things up and get things back in order? I don't know. It could take a whole fucking year. Who knows?

Ekphrastics: Paper Wings

A white bed sheet sprawled across a sofa,
the scent of body odor and sweat hangs
in the air, a person in a coma
once laid here, this is the place where he bangs

a multitude of women, the moist sheets
contain messages written in semen
he does it once, twice, three times, then repeats
the ritual again like a demon.

How on earth does he get loads of women
to go along banging with him, it's a
mystery, he smells just like a lemon
that's why women give him the time of day.

If I had mysterious skills like him
I'd bang a million women on a whim.

but it was inappropriate for the time,
and it was not to be changed for the time
that it was there and it was
not to be changed for the majority.

Ekphrastics: Vacation Apocalypse

A jet plane on its way to Australia
carries passengers of every color,
race, and creed. Along the plains Thalia
inspires the shepherds to write another

poem about goats and sheep, that they do.
Little do they know that the planes above
spew great clouds of carbon dioxide through
the atmosphere and a multitude of

other gasses that cause global warming.
One area suffers from massive floods,
another suffers a drought, bugs swarming
fields eating everything they can. Blue bloods

and titans of industry hardly care
about all the pollution in the air.

You will probably not believe this shit
but I'm totally feeding my flowers
vitamin and caffeine pills chopped to bits
mixed with liquids and raining like showers

from a two liter plastic bottle on
the chopped up pieces of twigs, leaves and buds
on the potted dirt, clippings from the lawn,
and the bathtub's water awash with suds.

This is strange stuff, and this is kind of fun,
this is an experience and maybe
an experiment too. The beating sun
feeding them from above, and then there's me,

placing nutrients at their feet. Buds brim
from behavior I copy from The Sims.

The agony is real.
it's like a pain
somewhere in
the

it's like pain everywhere
and
well,
The agony is real.

I really have no idea what i was agonizing about in this post. it was September. it just seems so long ago, and i really don't know what was going on in my life at that time.

...

Well. This happened.
and you know
i didn't want it to happen

Well. This happened.
and i was hoping it
wouldn't happen again

Well. This happened.
and you would things I would have gotten
over it by now

I don't really remember what was going on in this posts. there are  a number of screen shots from my Robinhood portfolio. I don't think that i was doing anything interesting at this time, i don't think i was writing options. but I'm really not sure.

best of all you can see
that I've been telling you
what you need to
see well here it
is.

Here's a poem
Vladimir Putin is a total Jerk
Who says the US sells satellites on sticks
Maybe, indeed, these 
are words in your mouth
Be glad its not my massive 7.5 inch
Super Willie!
Your behavior in Europe is definitely the obscenest:
Hope you never taste my super Weiner sweetness!
Here's a poem
Vladimir Putin is a total punk
He said the US sells satellites on sticks
Maybe, indeed, these 
are words in your mouth
Be glad its not my massive 7.5 inch
Super Johnson!

I took care of the parking issue, renewing my lease, paying my card. I registered my car,
Bought stamps.

I don't know what the future holds, but, I've founds stamps useful.
I want to buy some coins, and maybe some money.
What else?

I would like to take a nap.
and get some rest
and really put my head down.
yeah. that's really what I would
like to do.

The Chestnut + Hazel Logo is complete, not because I think that it has achieved perfection, but because I'm just not going to work on it anymore. I'm going to register a copyright for all of the attempts, and the one that I'm going to use as a logo is the one I'm going to register the trademark for.























So that's it, that's the Logo, that's the trademark. I'm done, and again, I don't think that it's prefect, but it's at a point in it's evolution, and I'm at a point in my energy levels where I think I'm going to leave it here.

...

Well, I guess I'll leave it there for now, one of the issues is that I completed the paperwork to register a copyright for The Complete Letters from Sanford Street, and it needs to be published somewhere, so I have to leave it there, in it's more or less existing condition before starting to edit it and all that. I'm not sure what's so sensitive about it, since is strictly text.

...

I don't know what to do about this.



















This is such a long post, and going over everything is going to take an eternity. This could take a long time to edit. This is a nightmare. This is all text and I could swear that there is nothing totally unusual here.

I'm continuing to work through The Complete Letters from Sanford Street, removing anything that I think violates the community standards. Even if I didn't have to deal with Blogger, I still have to deal with AdSense, so I might as well do all of this.


...

I'm getting ready to finish some work that I've been working on for the past few days. As far as going on another road trip goes, to Utah or Idaho, that's really something that's going to have to wait. I signed up for overtime next week, and, that's not really going to leave any free time for me, I signed up for two quarter shifts, and then half shifts were later offered, but I couldn't take them because I had already taken the quarter shifts.

...

Today is Friday, and I'm not really feeling in a particularly good mood. It comes and goes, but I'm not really sure how to shake it, how to get rid of this feeling of sadness. It's hard to function. Thank God I'd finished my homework. I'm compiling my Letters from Sanford Street Series. I can't really believe how long ago this all was. The whole Texas thing. weird times, something out of a nightmare. Letter's from Sanford Street # 490 is where the New Orleans Road Trip Disaster is documented.

...

Good god. What is this? I'm so sick of it. Out of nowhere the unhappiness. Out of the blue, the blues.

...

Class is over, and I'm really tired. I'm going to take a nap.

...

While taking, or attempting to take a selfie, I noticed that I'm really nice and fat, and that I could stand to lose some weight.

...

What do I have to work on? what things do I need to work on? Is there anything I need to do, and I'm just missing it?

...






























...



















































Thursday and Friday I'm off work. I kind of wish that I had moved a shift later on in the week because, like always, I could have used the money. but, I don't know what it is but I'm just not performing well at work. I'm tired all the time, and no matter what I do, it's the same issue, I've been consuming substantially more caffeine, but, to no avail, I'm just too tired and fatigued, and then I get these moment where I'm paralyzed with sadness. I shouldn't have skipped two days of work,

...

I'm back home. I'm in a better mood. I have to think. If I go anywhere again, I think I'll wait until Wednesday Morning of next week. That's August 2nd. I'm working on a favicon. It's related to my class coursework, but, I wasn't required to make a favicon, just provide an example of one. but I decided I would make a favicon for Chestnut + Hazel.

Unrelated, but I did see something funny, and thought it was something else:











it turns out it was just for campaign contributions for some such politician or another, but, yeah, I don't know. i kind of swore off online dating a few months back, and really, I don't really want to try that again.
