I don't know where else to write this. 
I could write it on my GitHub page, but 
I kind of screwed up that page while reorganizing 
things, so I'll just write it here.

I'm applying for a number of programs as UNLV: the MFA 
Creative Writing Program, the MS Quantitative Finance 
Program, and the MS Computer Science program.

I didn't realize this until just now: each program has a 
different due date, the MFA application is due first, 
or earliest or whatever, in January.

They are all of the Fall semester of 2024. I have to get the 
MFA application ready before January. I wrote 
one poem recently, and I really can't 
remember the last time I wrote one:

"The Young Woman who is the Post Office" (2022)

The rural carrier associate is a 
young woman with a lisp that lingers
long enough to wreck your week, and
fiery jade eyes that burn in your
mind every subsequent week.

I try to buy stamps, twenty is too much for
one stamp, and she can't break bills, and
I can't have them all, I ask to trade stamps,
one for one, she's not sure that's okay,
so she phones a friend; she asks
if I have exact change and I say:
yes! I do.

"This Is Just To Say Something About The Young Housewife" (2023)

I totally ate all of the  so many    fried turkeys
that were hanging out
by the red wheelbarrow
you know     the one glazed with
soy sauce and beside the 
                      kentucky fried 
                             kung pao chickens
           which 
themselves were drenched in
              tabasco sauce

I request neither forgiveness
nor do I intend to apologize for
          my actions 

because 

I spent several hours
of quality time
with a certain young housewife

                    who

braless and dressed in negligee 

          and 

whose wild hair suggested
she spent even more additional
even higher quality time with
both the ice man
and the fish man

       either sequentially 
               or 
              simultaneously 
                     neither would surprise me

left me    breathless    exhausted
as well as      famished

I thought I gave a good
account of myself

but then along came 
          the milkman
and    she             still
   had enough energy 
       for 
    round four

I was there
I saw it all

I'm tired. What do I have due today? I have a few class assignments and a Project due. I've been working on 
the project for days, and I've had a really hard time with it. I'll insert a few iframes below.

5

anyway, I'm kind of lost and don't really know what to do, i need to go over this course material. I don't know why this most 
recent project has monopolized my time. I got tied down with front-end 
aspects that had almost nothing to do with the assignment, and I'm irritated about it.

My new restart version of project 14 did not go as well as I thought it would have gone. I don't know what to do. I'm in a bad mood. 

There are two things that I'm thinking about doing, forking project 14 version 2 to start project 14 version 3, making one more attempt 
at the iframe carousel, and then getting the JSON and asynchronous stuff into project 14.

the other idea is going back to project 14 version 1 and just shoving the 2 additional things into it, it's a mess, but it works, 
and the cleaner version 2 doesn't work.

Irritated.

6

i'm in class right now, and all this new material is going way over my head. I'm tired, and I haven't paid attention in class in weeks. 
most of the time I'm in class trying to figure out past assignments.

7

my nails are. and I swore I just cut them, but they are long enough to be interfering with my ability to type.

8

do I have any money?

9

I'm a little bit lost right now.

10

I'm trying to think. There are a number of things I need to get done today.
I finished project 14, there were a lot of things that I wanted to do with
it, but, I ended up just going with the leaflet integration option, and
even doing that took a mountain of time. I integrated leaflet to my
Hamburgers project, and Connections for Mobile assignment.

I have a few class assignments, and I also have
some kind of professional development project that I have to
do.

and
I think that might be it.

I think this was about my chestnut + hazel connections page for project 14.

17

I'm uploading content to my YouTube channel, I'm not sure how exciting these videos are. 
some of these videos are very long, and take a long time to upload as well, and I can't really upload all of them at once because 
my account doesn't have those permissions just yet.

18

my nails aren't that long, but I had to cut them because they are messing with my ability to type again.

I really don't know what to do about money.

Even with as much time as I've spent on this, and seemingly no closer to getting a JSON file working, I seem to have
made a breakthrough with this carousel. The iframes look like they are interactive in a way that they were not interactive
in the original Project 10 version of the carousel.

I'm setting up links to see if the iframes in the carousel work, and if they do, then that means this should work. and I can
get project 14 completed, even though this seems like it was kind of a long digression from the requirements of project 14.

-->

21

I'm spending some time today to work on my blog, as well as my YouTube channel. 
I don't know. I need to do something with these gaming videos, like add 
narration, or, say something, about what I'm thinking, about what some of my 
decisions are when I'm playing. I'm kind of thinking of going with the Vanilla 
version, rather than playing with so many mods, but, if there isn't one annoying 
issue with the game, there is usually some other annoying issue. One thing 
that takes up a lot more time than I would like it to, is the whole business of 
managing the faction and ruling dynasty.

22

This is one of my earlier videos from the channel, when I 
spent time reading poetry and all of that. It's 
interesting to see all of the voice over stuff 
that can be done with text to speech programs. I actually 
saw an advertisement for one that I was really impressed with.

"Here's to momma dollar, and poppa dollar!"

I don't know what to do about money.

26

This is such a nightmare. Everything.

27

There is an issue with posting youtube 
videos in iframes, they have to 
have /embed/ in the source path. 
headache. I thought that the video just wasn't 
totally live or deployed on YouTube, but it 
might be totally not going to work.

28

 It seems like my upload limit for my YouTube channel is 8 videos 
 for any 24 hour period. Nothing I've produced 
 is particularly interesting, but, I'll come up with something.

29

Total War  ROME 2 Battle of Ephesus

The Spartans are on the warpath throughout Asia 
Minor, no one can stop them, except for the even more amazing 
Roman Military! They will be stopped! Even if they! are! Sparta!

30

I'm spending way too much time playing 
computer games. I'm trying to make something 
out of it by recording videos 
while I play, but the videos I make aren't 
all that amazing.

31

There is something that I'm thinking about right now.
well. sometimes I listen to music or a documentary
while I work on other things. sometimes as an attempt at 
multi-tasking.

but right now it just seems more appropriate to work on 
this epic and fabulous poem of mine!

32

Good Lord! I spent the entire day gaming, the 
entire past few days actually, and I've not 
gotten any real work done, 
or, well, I don't really feel like I've gotten 
any work done.

33

I worked on my blog a little bit, made a few videos of me 
fixing broken links on my blog. I have to work on Project 15, 
and I really haven't even looked at what's required. 
There's an issue with creating an embedded iframe, it's not really
possible to link just the YouTube page into an iframe as a 
regular source, and suddenly I realize why, 
you only want the video, and not the whole page that's on YouTube. 

34

Walking Through The Grass (2019)

I remember walking 
to work, about a mile or so 
to a hotel where I worked, and
I had to walk through the grass
and the grass
was always wet, really wet, and 
my pants would get wet too 
and my boots would get wet 
and my socks would get wet.

36

I spent a lot of time on that project, I really enjoy the end result. I 
still want to make the contact modal work. These are comments removed from my GitHub files.

37

All the videos are now uploaded to YouTube. It took so long. i deleted my miscellaneous 
repository, but then, i created a new miscellaneous repository because I have the index to that 
repository linked elsewhere, so, I didn't want them to break, so I fixed it before it became a problem.

38

These videos that I've uploaded to YouTube today are taking forever to load. This time, I made the 
decision to upload the largest files, rather than whatever random videos occurred to me to upload. 
I figured that I could get these large files out of my 
storage space. but, yeah, they are taking forever to upload.

39

My software development course will be over next week. This comes as kind of a relief, but I'm also 
kind of sad about it, I really enjoyed this class. I don't know how I'm going to continue to stay 
motivated to work on web and software development projects without project being due, everything I 
work on after class will be a self directed project. Yeah, I've been spending way too much, 
mountains of time playing computer games.

40

There is kind of a chicken and egg problem going on here. I need to 
get an MMR vaccine to attend UNLV, I got my first dose something like 
5 years ago when I applied to the MBA program at UNLV, I need to get a 
second dose. I must have left Las Vegas before getting my second dose of 
the MMR vaccine. I thought I took it already when I applied at UTA, but 
the vaccine that UTA required was a meningitis vaccine. The funny thing 
about the UTA thing, the meningitis vaccine, was that they kept sending 
me notices to submit proof of vaccination for meningitis, but when I got 
around to getting the vaccine and uploading proof, it turns out I didn't 
really need to get it, it was for undergrads only. Waste of money.

41

So now I have to figure out how to get the MMR vaccine, the second dose. The 
chicken and egg problem that I'm facing is that I need my MMR vaccine to enroll 
in classes at UNLV, but I have to be enrolled in classes at UNLV to get a Student 
ID card, and use the Student Health Services and get vaccinated. This isn't a huge 
problem, it just means that I have to get vaccinated somewhere else.

42

I was experimenting with layouts for katastrophiena.com, and I really liked 
the layout that I selected, and I actually decided to apply it to 
chestnutandhazel.com. I think that it's really nice, and nothing 
really broke. I recently. I've been making all the measurements 
for the iframes percentage based, all the dimensions percentage 
based, because I figured that I might change layouts from time to 
time, and it seems to have kept things from getting messed up with 
the new layout, or, style.

43
 
I don't know what to do right now. 
I should be working on Project 16 right 
now. It's actually. I don't actually have 
to turn it in, but I should do it because 
I need the experience of doing it, and, 
well, I've just felt a whole lot less motivated lately.

44

My mind is kind of all over the place 
right now. I have a lot of things to worry 
about right now. I'm watching The Untouchables, 
Brian de Palma (1987), and this really is a good 
movie. Class starts in a few minutes. There is 
only one more day of class left, Saturday the 18th, 
but it's just a get-together kind of for the final day of class.

I have this other laptop, a second one, and it's 
extremely slow, and I use it for watching the live course 
via zoom, and I use my main laptop to do the work, but this 
thing, my other laptop, is taking forever to load, it's always 
slow, it's been slow since I bought it, and I'm really 
surprised with how slow it is. I bought it during one of the 
road trips, but, it's really super 
slow. so slow that it hardly functions.

45

I remember these poems from when I moved to Missouri from Las 
Vegas. I remember I didn't find work there for a 
while. In Missouri. I did get a job at the prison in town, 
but then, it wasn't really a job that was suitable 
for me, and, it wasn't a good environment 
for me either. I don't know what to do right now.

46

I'm using VS code right now, working on compiling the Adventures
of Chestnut + Hazel into a unified EPIC poem of the most EPIC 
proportions!

47

I am failing MIS 768. Some of this is my own doing. 
when is it not my own doing? but
one of the things
that makes this first semester different from the
web development course I took with Correlation One
is that I'm working right now. 

48

I decided to take work off during the Fall, but I've 
decided that I can't really afford to do that during the 
spring. Nightmare. 

49

I don't know. like. this might be 
the end of my educational pursuits.

I'm going to post some old poems I wrote, 
probably while I was at Mosaic, or during 
the first few months when I first came to Missouri.

50

I guess you could call it
something of a wooded area.

51

There are trees and stuff and
A little bit of other flora.

52

I really like it.

I want to put all the ashes there
and let the trees absorb the nutrients of
the ashes. Maybe someday there will be
a cure for whatever illness needs curing
in that tree.

53

After we burn the trash, we look for any metal
that we can sell to the scrap yard. Burnt Tires
leave wires of metal that can be sold to the
scarp yard. What metal is it. I don't know.

54

All the gaming videos that I've captured are either being uploaded to my 
Chestnut + Hazel channel, or my personal channel, so that's out of the way, 
but many of the files are very large, and they are taking a long time to 
upload, so I have to find something else to do in the meantime, I was supposed 
to update my browser either today or yesterday, but I forgot to do it, with all 
of this uploading I have to do, I have to keep my browser open. So I basically 
haven't closed it and re-opened it to update my browser.

55

My plans for the next few days are to finish uploading all of my gaming videos 
to my Chestnut + Hazel YouTube channel, and then hold off on gaming for a while. 
I could probably get all of that done today. I have so many videos uploaded already, 
and I think that I have about 20 more that I'm in the process of uploading. I scheduled 
them way out into the future, all the way until the end of 2024 because I didn't want them 
all dropping at once. Once that's done I'm going to focus on putting together my UNLV 
applications. I just noticed something funny, I noticed that when Slack loads, the 
screen says: Reticulating Splines, which is from SimCity.

I have 7 videos left to upload. A lot of these videos have just been sped up with 4x or 
16x to reduce the file size, and make the action happen more quickly.

56

I'm really happy about completing the Software 
Development course, and I'm really proud of 
this. Tomorrow is the last day of class, but it's 
not really a full class. I'm not sure what to do next.

57

Below I've posted an old video of a poetry reading video that I made years ago.

58

I'm not sure what to work on right now. Today is 
Sunday, and everything is kind of a free day for a 
while. I should look for work. Apply for a few positions. 
I made a few game playing videos where I have voice overs or 
narrations what what's going on, and what decisions I'm making. 
Even with the videos sped up to 10x to 16x, there still seems 
to be a lack of things to say.

59

so what am I up to right now? I'm really just making gaming videos and 
uploading them to YouTube. I tried making a YouTube short, but I think my 
video was over budget, time wise. I guess I'll find out. I could have sworn that 
I've seen YouTube shorts that are in the 4 minute range. I bought this down to 1:25 
minutes, but I'm not sure if that's short enough to be a short.

60

I'm feeling worried about the future. 
I went in for my entrance exam for the 
Spanish Translation program, and I don't 
really think that it went well: I didn't 
really study because I spent these last few 
days immersed in my gaming, and didn't do 
anything else really, and now, I'm sick of the 
game, and now I probably have time to do productive 
stuff. Part of the reason I wasn't really motivated 
to study was because I did manage to get accepted into 
the Entrepreneurship and Innovation program, and I already 
enrolled in as many classes as I plan to take, and my 
original goal was to get into one program or the other.

The thing that I'm worried about for the future is money. 
I've been out of work for 4 months, and I also 
haven't had any income, money coming in during 
that time. I tried to sign up for food delivery 
stuff, but that didn't really work. I don't really 
know what to do. I don't know what to do. I really 
don't know what to do. I would like to be working, 
but I really need to find the right role. I need to 
land the right role, the right position.

61

I'm not really looking for an employer right now.
and this comment is related to stanza 60 above,
this is akward because these are written right after
the other, but happened at very different times.
I was looking for a role last year, but not this year. 
four months later.

62

I have an exam tomorrow, and I'm not even really prepared. In 
fact I'm not even really prepared at all. I was working on this 
Spanish Translations project, but it really hasn't gone anywhere, 
and it's not even close to being done. I also have to find work; 
I thought about doing the food delivery and rideshare stuff, but, 
I had an incident today where I concluded that it might not really be 
something that is workable. There are major traffic issues in Las Vegas 
that make driving really frustrating, and I'm not really sure I would be 
able to do it. I still need to find work, though. Or some source of income.

63

there was an employer 
event at UNLV that I would have 
attended, and that I was going to attend.
but I did not attend the event. things weren't 
going well in MIS 768, so I scrapped any plans for 
that week, only for things to really go downhill 
in that class.

64

I shaved, and I think that my face looks a lot nicer than it 
does when I have facial hair, but I didn't shave my head, but 
I still think that I look a lot nicer when I have my face shaved. 
I exfoliated, and I had a lot of dead skin and all that. It was 
really kind of gross, but I was really happy to get my face clean. 
I worked on my translations project. 

The favicon stuff is annoying. sizing and stretching things. making 
it look right it the browser tab. important. but annoying.

65

I've been kind of not really doing anything lately. Nothing, other than playing on the computer, 
and really just playing from the start over and over, again and again. I bought a phone mount, 
like the kind for my car, but I mounted it on my wall next to my desk. This is kind of cool, and 
I've been thinking about doing this for a while, but didn't do it, because I didn't really want to 
spend the money on something like this, but it really helps because I usually watch movies on my 
phone, rather than my computer, and when my phone is just sitting on my desk I can't really see 
what's going on on-screen.

I have 1 more class I need to enroll in at UNLV. Just like at UTA, I have to request permission 
for pretty much every class I try to enroll in. I'm not sure how long I should wait before 
reaching out a second time. The annoying thing is, is that I didn't realize before hand that 
I needed to request permission for every class I need to take, so I didn't ask permission for 
both classes the first time, I only requested permission for the one class I thought that I 
needed to request permission for. I thought the other class didn't require it, so I'm waiting 
for the other class to be unlocked.

Spring (2023)

Translated from Primaveral (1888) by Rubén Darío

During the blossoming months, my
rhymes run in circles through a vast
forest to collect nectar and
aromatics from blooming flowers.

Come, my love! to our place: the hallowed
grove where an ambience of love floats
above the aromas of the foliage of Spring.

A bird flies from tree to tree and
greets you, and your face, blushing
and as beautiful as the dawn and the
superb oaks, tall and robust,

tremble as you walk by, its leaves
shake and its branches rise to give
way to the queen. My Love! It's the
sweet spring season.

67

There are a number of challenges I'm facing when it comes to monetizing my blogs 
or my other content. There are a whole bunch of Search Console issues that I'm not 
clear about how to fix, and then there are minimum viewer requirements on YouTube 
that will take a while to complete, and then there are content issues with Blogger 
that aren't really clear to me how to resolve.

68

I want to get a new gaming laptop, but I have to wait until next year. One that 
meets the minimum requirements for the games I'm looking to play, even the new 
ones, doesn't look too expensive, it's more than I would normally spend on a 
laptop for general use, but it seems less than what gaming laptops costs, or, 
what I'm used to seeing gaming laptops cost. One of the things I'm not too sure 
about is how long the deal will last, or if 
gaming laptops should drop in general later on.

I'm trying to turn my gaming into something like a business, but, yeah, I don't 
fully know how to do that. I seem to be getting more attention my my regular 
YouTube channel when compared to my Chestnut + Hazel YouTube channel.

69

These posts. and this is just a note. these stanzas, although 
they are numbered sequentially, the events they refer to are not 
in. they are not necessarily in chronological order.  

they might not even be in the order 
they were originally published in. and not in the order 
they were originally written in. so. good luck to anyone

There
are no words to 
describe
the agony of
eating too much
food at the buffet
when you go to
the buffet 
and eat all 
that you can eat.

There was a place that i came across 
today while I was out DoorDashing, 
and it was a place called ONO or 
something. Ono Sushi. I just looked 
it up. I think that I might want to eat there.

71

I did food delivery work today. I delivered 1 meal. It didn't take long to 
get the first order, but after that order, the zone I was working in dried 
up, so I switched zones, once I got there, there weren't really any orders 
to pick up, so I figured there wasn't really much work that day, so I went 
home. I've very rarely been able to make delivering food profitable.

72

If she asks me 
why I wasn't able to 
get anything done while 
she was away, I will tell her 
the truth: I was thinking about 
you, and when I think about you, 
when I started thinking about you 
I couldn't stop masterbating.
so I fell asleep. afterward.

I deleted my facebook, instagram, twitter (X), and 
linkedin accounts. I also think that deleted a 
number of other social media accounts as well, 
Pinterest. I'm not sure I really used that account.

One of the things that sometimes worried me about using. 
one of the things that often worried me about deleting 
these accounts is that. Maybe. someone might create a 
fake account using my name and all that. I don't know. 
I won't worry about that right now. I'm honestly. really. 
I'm surprised how many other Ken Yamat, and kenneth Yamat 
profiles are out there. I guess my name isn't all that 
special after all.

78

Door Dashing really can be a challenge. 
and. it's not always just a simple game of 
picking up and dropping off food.

i. honestly. really wish it was that easy.

79

Um. So I did Door Dash today, I had one order. 
for like 3 hours of driving, and I'm somewhat 
discouraged. After spending all that money to obtain 
business licenses, and getting a commercial auto policy 
that's way more expensive than what I was paying for a 
personal policy. I'm, you know. Not sure what to do.

The order that I did get was somewhat accidental, I was 
toggling between per order and per hours just to check 
it out, and the order I got was a per hour order.

and I'm thinking, it might make sense to switch between 
the two during certain times of the day. The traffic was 
really bad in whatever area I was in.

Anyway. I called it a day after trying for 3 hours, and only 
getting one order. Some days are better than others, and I think. 
on days where it seems like slim pickings, it might make sense 
to just go back home and work on something else.

80

Today. and I'm referring to the 18th, I often stay up 
overnight. Today wasn't a very fruitful day in terms of 
Door Dashing. The weekend wasn't as much of a money maker 
as I thought it would have been.

My conclusion is that it might be better to start later on 
in the day. Maybe around 8:00 PM or something. I've been 
pushing my start times back further and further. I 
thought 4:00 PM was already somewhat late.

If I'm going to work nights, then I need to buy a jacket.

82

DoorDashing. yeah. I'm really not looking 
for an employer right now. being self-employed 
is a challenge, but. I'm just really not looking 
for an employer right now.

83

I managed to buy a jacket today.

84

Money hasn't been this tight in a while, but there is 
one positive thing. I think that I'm able to stop pulling 
money out of my savings, and eventually, to start paying 
down my credit balances.

85

Life is extremely challenging right now.

86

I went on a road trip. not a very exciting one, but, 
I don't know. I'm in a slightly better mood than before. 
I went from Las Vegas, to San Diego, to Yuma, and back to Vegas.

87

Really not looking for an employer right now. I'm really not.

I went on a road trip. not a very exciting one, but, I don't

Las Vegas, to San Diego, to Yuma, and back to Vegas.

88

My focus right now is to work on my 
catalog of intellectual property.
my focus is not to find an employer.

89

If I were still filing a continued unemployment claim 
I probably would be looking for an employer, but since I'm 
not filing a claim, I'm not looking!

I went on a road trip. not a very exciting one, 
but, I don't know. I'm in a slightly better mood

91

as far as MIS 768 goes. I'm just not really sure 
what to do right now. and what I mean is:
I know that I'm failing the course. I know that I 
will have to audit the course. what I'm trying 
to figure out is how to salvage this situation? 
how do I, you know, still get something for the 
money I paid to take the course?

92

A few days ago I took a road trip from 
Las Vegas, to San Diego, to Yuma, and back 
to Las Vegas. San Diego reminds me of Austin, 
just older and larger.

93

There is a convention from MIS 768 that I like, and it's this:

/*		
Author's Name: 		    	Kenneth Larot Yamat

Purpose of Program:			To calculate the shipping 
                            cost of a parcel at a 
                            parcel service store
                        
Date Due:					March 3rd, 2024
*/

94

I don't know how I would use that in this document.
this is going to be registered as a Poem, like an Epic Poem 
of ancient antiquity!

95

Life is something of a 
nightmare right now.

I thought the bleeding would 
stop, that I'd get my 
budget in order during December, 
but that is something that did not happen.

I don't even want to make any remarks 
about what I anticipate for January, 
out of a fear that I might jinx it.

96

// /**/System.out.println(" Data for Package # 1"); // entryNumber// this number

School starts soon. Later on 
in the month. There are a few 
things I need to get done to prepare, 
but I've been so busy doing DoorDash 
that I haven't exactly come around to 
it, but I have to get it done today.

99

I'm in a really lousy mood right now. 
I'm kind of stressed out. I'm kind of 
frustrated about things right now.

I managed to finish quite a bit of the 
required tasks for school. Mostly 
orientation related tasks and online 
modules.

I need to go out Door Dashing and all that, 
but I'm really tired right now, but it's 
kind of a mood related fatigue.

100

When something is published. When something 
is pushed to GitHub. I really do considered 
published. because. it's avaiable to the 
public. it's just that not many people 
are on, you know digging around in repositories
reading text files and all that.

but I do consider this published.

102

Back in November I bought a vape pen a refillable one 
after trying the disposable vape pens for a while and this 
thing will not stop leaking I don't know what to do I'm 
thinking about getting a different type of vape pen I'm 
not sure I really like the disposable vape pens but it's 
primarily based on cost because the disposables are 
just so expensive

School has started and yesterday was our first day of orientation 
this semester I'm taking two classes both of them are MIS classes

I'm enrolled in the entrepreneurship program I'm not sure 
what kind of business I would start if I were to start one 
the other day I was trying to buy clothes and I just have 
so many problems with getting the correct fit and if I were 
to start something it would be like some kind of clothes 
business I thought about buying a sewing machine because 
like my pants are just too damn long but I don't know if 
I really want to start sewing stuff because it's such a 
headache I have all these pants that just don't fit and 
it never really mattered because I always wore boots so 
like if if my pants were too long it wasn't really a 
problem and I really didn't notice.

I'm using text to speech to write this. I don't really 
get much time to sit down and type so finding this feature 
on my phone has turned out to be really useful. nothing is 
punctuated and I guess that's just the way text to speech 
works, but I could always go back and punctuate this if I need to.

There are a few things that I realized while I was door 
dashing that made me start to use text to speech one of 
the things was that I can't really type if I'm driving 
but if I use the phone if somebody wants to access what 
I have to say they have to access their voicemail box 
like if I leave a message and so it just made more sense 
to use text to speech and send it by text the way they 
could just read whatever I said it's not like I'm really 
saying anything to complex when I'm using text to speech 
for the most part anyway

A while ago I think I wrote about how I wanted to buy 
a jacket and what ended up happening is that I ended 
up buying two sweaters two jackets and four pairs of 
pants after buying the sweaters I realized that I don't 
really like sweaters and part of the reason for that is 
that with jackets I have a jacket pocket and I don't really 
like having so many things in my pants pockets so I bought 
these sweaters and I'm not really planning on using them

I really like the sweaters but from a usefulness 
standpoint I just don't anticipate 
ever really wearing them

103

classes start on the 16th. the two orientation 
classes are over. I wore a tie for the second day, 
but, it was mostly for getting a portrait photograph 
taken, but, I seem to have missed it. I guess I thought 
that there would be a kind of designated time to get our 
portrait photos taken, but, it was more of whenever you 
have the opportunity to get one kind of deal. and. yeah, i missed it.

105

I bought a new toilet seat. The wood ones were 
less expensive than the plastic ones, which was nice, 
so, I bought a wood one.

106

I'm trying to think.

107

I bought a parking pass. I think that I only 
have class once a week, and it's after parking 
enforcement hours. so maybe I didn't really need to 
pay for a parking permit, but then again, I might be on 
campus to do this or that, and, I'm going to apply for 
positions on campus, so I might use it.

I need to get a new phone, my current phone is cracked, 
and, it's also kind of falling apart.

109

I finally bought a new phone. My last one 
cracked not too long after I bought it. It 
was weird because I hadn't cracked a phone 
that soon after buying it in a while. I think 
I had it for 7 months. My last phone was really 
falling apart, it wasn't just cracked.

110

I'm really frustrated right 
now. I really feel like 
going on a short road trip 
to blow off some steam, but 
I kind of scheduled an appointment 
for Monday, but there was no 
confirmation on the other side, so.

and

today is 
already monday.

so. a road trip is 
kind of out of the 
question right now.

and

i have to be prudent 
about how i waste my time.

maybe i could go out and

eat something ridiculous, but
i don't know of anything ridiculous
that's open at 3 AM.

the only kind of food that's available
at 3 AM is basically totally normal
kinds of food.

Let's see:

Hitchin' Post Saloon

I've actually been wanting to eat 
here for a while, but, I think this 
is some kind of steakhouse or something, 
and that's pretty much normal food.

Bourbon Street Sports Bar

I've eaten here before, and I think I spent like 30 bucks. 
I don't mind spending 30 bucks on a meal, but the meal 
has to be worth 30 bucks, and whatever I ate here really 
wasn't worth 30 bucks.

Northstar Bar and Grill

this place is close, but I think it's just 
normal food.

there are a number of taco stands and taco trucks, 
the last time I went to a taco stand I spent 47 
dollars. i think I ate 18 tacos, it was some 
multiple of 6. I think it was 14 tacos actually.

I want to eat some kind of
fish.

I'm still in a really lousy mood right now.

i'm trying to think.

I want to eat indian food.

Delhi Indian & Nepali Cuisine Express

the building that's on google maps 
isn't really all that sexy.
but the address

333 W St Louis Ave, Las Vegas, NV 89102

I basically have to eat there now.
and here's why

333 is simply one of my favorite numbers.

and west saint louis just kills me because

kansas city is in the west and saint louis is on the 
eastern part of missouri. kansas city is part kansas and 
part missouri, and saint louis is part missouri and part illinois.

place isn't open right now though.

oh. I realize what this is.

it's a
Virtual restaurant

it's basically doordash only kind of orders. 
like it basically only exists to fulfill doordash orders.

I'm still trying to think.

at this point i'm not even hungry anymore.

i'm in slightly less of a bad mood.

111

good god.

i need to get something to eat

i'm not hungry really

i'm just not really in much of a good mood.

i'm in a really garbage kind of mood.

i'm not even hungry.
and
eating something is not really
a solution

but i can't really think of anything else 
i enjoy doing

i don't feel hungry

112

so i ended up at saffron flavors of india

113

this is one of the few times i've ever 
successfully fixed a Google Search Console 
issue. but this also comes with . this also 
came with a seperate email stating that i 
had not resolved some other - seperate 
google search console issue.

114

i have to watch what i eat when i go out. i really
feel like i ate too much.
i have to get these small assignments done.
I don't know what to do for money. I haven't interviewed for anything in a while.

[Development Commentary]

<!-- [11/04/2023 23:10] Create a link for Chestnut and Hazel Connection, Mobile Version -->

Sometimes when I go into interviews it's not clear to me if the interviewer 
is just looking to kill time, or if they are actually looking to fill the 
role. When I went into this interview with Copart, it felt like the interviewer 
only had the intention of mocking my work history, and like, she didn't start the 
interview until an hour or so after the scheduled time.

I'm still really angry that my unemployment claim was denied, 
and that I'm not getting paid out on it.

but.

if they aren't going to pay me, then I almost see no reason to look for work.
I'll keep looking as long as I have an appeal outstanding, but, in many ways it
feels like looking for work is a total waste of my time.

I'm worried about running out of money before I get into college. 
I can't seem to put together
enough letters of recommendation, and, this is a real nightmare. A real nightmare.

I can't really leave Las Vegas, and UNLV is the only college in Las Vegas 
that has a graduate school.
All the programs at UNLV require more letters of recommendation that I can 
reasonably put together,
and. I don't know.

Total War ROME 2: Battle of Pella (2023) During the Macedonian wars of 209 BC The 
Julian Dynasty takes the bold move to attack the Macedonians at the very heart of 
their empire: The Capital of Pella. Defended by their own world renowned Macedonian 
warriors, and reinforced by their Epirot and Spartan allies, the Capital of Pella 
makes for a difficult battle, over the course of three separate major assaults on 
the city, Pella is finally captured by none other than Sextus Nerva himself.

I had to get 
rid of a bunch 
of this stuff for 
some reason.

115

I don't why my life always goes 
straight to hell every now and then.

116

what a nightmare. a total nightmare. 
I don't know what else to say. things 
are not going the way that I want them 
to. headache. nightmare. life oscillates 
between being a headache, to a nightmare, 
and back.

117

I'm not sure what to work on right now. 
Today is Sunday, and everything is kind of a 
free day for a while. I should look for work. 
Apply for a few positions. I made a few game 
playing videos where I have voice overs or 
narrations what what's going on, and what 
decisions I'm making. Even with the videos 
sped up to 10x to 16x, there still seems to 
be a lack of things to say.

119

so what am I up to right now? I'm really 
just making gaming videos and uploading them 
to YouTube. I tried making a YouTube short, 
but I think my video was over budget, time wise. 
I guess I'll find out. I could have sworn that 
I've seen YouTube shorts that are in the 4 minute 
range. I bought this down to 1:25 minutes, but I'm 
not sure if that's short enough to be a short.

120

I am failing MIS 768 right now. really 
hard too. I applied for the computer Science 
program, and. if i'm failing an MIS course. then.
well.

121

I've added some content below from my Spanish Translations 
project. I've recently got bogged down messing around with 
an old project that doesn't seem to work in it's new area. 
I don't know what's going on, or why it doesn't work except 
on my landing page. I did get rid of something that was 
making it kind of a headache, and the thing was the 
transform hover effect.

122

I'm going to forget about messing around with fixing the
project 11 contact form, for whatever reason, it does not
work. It's the same thing as what i have on my landing page,
so I don't know why it doesn't work. so dumb. I might try one
more thing. but then again, I really have to work on my
translations project, and this is just something I'm messing
around with.

123

I'm putting together the texts that I'll be translating for
this project. I'm also working on my YouTube videos. For video
editing, I'm mostly just consolidating and speeding up videos
and adding music, and uploading them, and I can't really do this
while playing the games themselves because my computer slows down
a lot.

Buying a new gaming laptop is something that I thought about, but
I think that I'll wait to do it. A gaming computer that can play
the games I want to play doesn't look too expensive, but I really
have to wait to spend that kind of money right now.


Two Spanish Language Authors have been replaced

César Vallejo with José de Espronceda
&
Pablo Neruda with Antonio Machado

I created a few additional JavaScript functions to allow
the contact forms to be visible inside the iframe and clickable
inside the list.

124

I think that everything has been set up, once everything is
deployed, then I can focus on making translations for the
pages that I've set up.

125

So I set up the .md files for the four authors that I'm going
to translate from English to Spanish, and the four authors
that I'm going to translate from Spanish to English. I selected
all authors whose work I expect to be in the Public Domain.

126

VS Code is such a great too. even 
for editing non-computer code 
documents.

127

Getting the Readme iframe and Document Title swap to work is complete,
the next stage in this project is to pick 4 authors to translate.

I'll pick four authors to translate from English to Spanish,
and 4 authors to translate from Spanish to English.

For English to Spanish:

William Carlos Williams
T. S. Eliot
Wallace Stevens
E. E. Cummings

For Spanish to English:

Rubén Darío
César Vallejo
Pablo Neruda
Miguel de Unamuno

128

This is awesome! it actually works, the title and the document
change when clicked! I'm going to come back around to this and
continue to work on it later.

129

There are a few other things that I need to work on, 
I need to set up katastrophiena to be eligible for 
AdSense, and, I think that the main thing is that 
I need a longer history of posts for this blog. This 
might take a while, and take away from all the other 
things that I'm working on. Anyway. I'm getting sucked 
into computer gaming right now, not with any games that 
are new, but games that I've had for a long time. I've 
been thinking about buying a gaming laptop, something 
inexpensive, and I came across one, but, I really 
have to hold out on buying anything like that right now.

I have to wait before spending money on something 
like a new laptop, at least until next year.

130

I'm working on a number of things right now. 
One is setting up a page on GitHub Pages for 
my Spanish Translations Project. I was having 
trouble with a contact forms section of my page, 
this isn't needed for my Translations Page, I just 
set it up so it works, or, I'm just been trying to 
make the links work. Basically, I took Project 16, 
my Project 16 page, and used it as a starting point 
for my Spanish Translations Project. One of the things 
I left from the old page and kept on the new page was 
a section for Contact Forms that I made throughout the 
course I took. There is one Contact Form that just doesn't 
really work. It's the one from Project 11 I don't know 
what wrong.

and I'm really not in the mood to work on it because. 
I just really don't really want to work on it right 
now. So I guess I wont.

131

There is one thing that I have found that helps 
with the video uploading process, for longer videos, 
it makes sense to speed up the video all the way up to 
16x speed, and the reason why is that, videos longer 
than an hour, and even longer than 10 minutes, are 
really slow paced, and it's much easier to get an 
idea of what's happening when the video is moving 
faster. This also reduces the file size, and makes 
uploading quicker.

There are some games that are really slow paced, 
like the tower game that I'm playing, but also, 
the same is true for many other city building games as well.

132

I need to come up with a better workflow for uploading 
gaming videos to YouTube. They take a hell of a long 
time to upload, especially larger files, I would reduce 
the file size, but it's not really clear to me how to do 
that. There is an issue with gaming videos, they often 
need to be high resolution, a lot of these videos need to 
be high resolution, I don't even have a very large screen 
on my laptop, and in many cases, the videos seem to be 
blurry. On the other hand, I'm not sure if these are 
going to be viewed mainly on a large screen, or a small 
screen, like a phone.

133

I'm thinking about how everything seems to have been falling 
apart for me over these past few months. I lost my job, I 
haven't found a new one, and I'm burning through my money. 
I'm a little bit demotivated. or unmotivated. or just basically 
lacking very much or even any motivation. I'm cutting it close 
it terms of money. I need to find work. Land a job or something.
 
The Internet connection here is slow, it's not normally this 
slow, but for whatever reason, it's slower than syrup. I'm 
working on a number of things right now, but I'm also kind 
of bouncing around mentally from idea to idea, from worry to 
worry.

Somewhere in the back of my mind I'm wondering if I'm cursed 
or something. Like, there's nothing I can do, and this is just 
the way things are going to go for me, but I have no idea why 
I would be cursed, or what would be the cause of the curse, or 
why I would be cursed, or who would want to place a curse on me.

134

I've added some content below from my Spanish Translations project. 
I've recently got bogged down messing around with an old project that

137

I haven't even looked at the Spanish Translation 
project in a while. After not passing the Spanish Entrance 
exam I more or less figured I would put it on the back burner.

I have to wait before spending money on something like a new 
laptop, at least until next year.

I'm working on a number of things right now. One is setting up 
a page on GitHub Pages for my Spanish Translations Project. I 
was having trouble with a contact forms section of my page, 
this isn't needed for my Translations Page, I just set it up 
so it works, or, I'm just been trying to make the links work. 
Basically, I took Project 16, my Project 16 page, and used it 
as a starting point for my Spanish Translations Project. One 
of the things I left from the old page and kept on the new page 
was a section for Contact Forms that I made throughout the course 
I took. There is one Contact Form that just doesn't really work. 
It's the one from Project 11 I don't know what wrong.

and I'm really not in the mood to work on it because. I just really 
don't really want to work on it right now. So I guess I wont.

143

There is one thing that I have found that helps with the video uploading 
process, for longer videos, it makes sense to speed up the video all the 
way up to 16x speed, and the reason why is that, videos longer than an 
hour, and even longer than 10 minutes, are really slow paced, and it's 
much easier to get an idea of what's happening when the video is moving 
faster. This also reduces the file size, and makes uploading quicker.

There are some games that are really slow paced, like the tower game 
that I'm playing, but also, the same is true for many other city 
building games as well.

144

I need to come up with a better workflow for uploading gaming videos 
to YouTube. They take a hell of a long time to upload, especially 
larger files, I would reduce the file size, but it's not really clear 
to me how to do that. There is an issue with gaming videos, they often 
need to be high resolution, a lot of these videos need to be high 
resolution, I don't even have a very large screen on my laptop, 
and in many cases, the videos seem to be blurry. On the other hand, 
I'm not sure if these are going to be viewed mainly on a large 
screen, or a small screen, like a phone.

145

I'm thinking about how everything seems to have been falling apart 
for me over these past few months. I lost my job, I haven't found 
a new one, and I'm burning through my money. I'm a little bit 
demotivated. or unmotivated. or just basically lacking very much 
or even any motivation. I'm cutting it close it terms of money. 
I need to find work. Land a job or something.
 
The Internet connection here is slow, it's not normally this slow, 
but for whatever reason, it's slower than syrup. I'm working on a 
number of things right now, but I'm also kind of bouncing around 
mentally from idea to idea, from worry to worry.

Somewhere in the back of my mind I'm wondering if I'm cursed or something. 
Like, there's nothing I can do, and this is just the way things are going 
to go for me, but I have no idea why I would be cursed, or what would be the 
cause of the curse, or why I would be cursed, or who would want to place a 
curse on me.

One of the issues I have with what I post on chestnutandhazel.com is that It's hosted, or whatever, it's really just an account
on blogger.com, so since it's basically a social media account, I have to comply with the community guidles of blogger.com, and
since I have adsense active on that page, I also have to comply with any adsense advertiser standards, so I have my hands tied 
in many respects. chestnutandhazel.com continues to get flagged over and over and over, and in many cases I don't really want to 
deal with it right away.

the other issue is that I also have to post what I write somewhere, so that I can use the standard copyright registration form,
rather than the unpublished copyright registration form, so, that's another issue. so you know, it's kind of whatever.

I'm feeling incredibly scatter brained. I have a project 
due for my software and web development course today, and 
I haven't even started. This should be simple, so I'm not 
too worried about it, but, at the same time, I know from 
the past that these things could take quite a while if I 
hit a brick wall.

There are other issues that I'm facing, especially on the 
income front. The temp assignment was not a particularly 
good fit, and, I really get the feeling that I should avoid 
any kind of warehouse or factory work, even though, that's 
sort of what I've been doing for the past five years, but I 
don't have the slightest clue what to look for.

Life is such an unbelievable struggle. I don't really know 
what to do about money. Somewhere in the back of my mind 
there's this voice telling me that I should stop looking 
for a job or employment or whatever, and, that I should 
focus on trying to make money doing stock market shit.

Reflection # 714 by Chestnut and Hazel

I don't know exactly what I've been spending on buying lunch and soda at work, 
but I know that it is too damn much, I want to say it is around 15 dollars per day. 
Too fucking much. I have to cut down on that for sure.

By Chestnut + Hazel at June 11, 2019 

Notes written on 10/10/2023 @ 10:19 AM, 
originally posted on GitHub

I think that I wrote this post while I was working 
at Case New Holland. I'm surprised that I was 
really spending that much. I 
Wonder what I was buying? I don't really remember. 
I think that it was mostly energy drinks. I don't 
remember my exact hours. 
It was overnight is as much as I remember. In 
Cameron, MO there isn't really much to eat if 
you're up at odd hours.

I'm working on Project 11 for my Web and Software 
Development course. I'm not really getting much 
done. I'm getting sidetracked
with other things. I'm really amazed that I get so 
little done, especially considering that I've had 
few other obligations other
than class these past few months. I really 
wonder what I've been doing.

Earlier in the course I would have a 
lot of fun playing around with our 
daily assignments, but, I haven't really 
done that in a
while, even though there have been plenty 
of opportunities to do so.

155

I don't really remember what those
old posts are about.

156

not off the top of my head anyway.

157

Life is such a nightmare right now. My expenses have increased, 
and my income has decreased, and I'm really not seeing any 
kind of light at the end of the tunnel.

Life is such a nightmare, but I'm not sure it's really ever been easy.

158

I'm trying to think. Today is Sunday. I feel like I wasted the 
entire day. In fact, it's actually already Monday.

159

I kind of blew off one of my professional development projects, the 
last one, but I didn't realize that it was required for passing the 
course, so I requested a redo of that project.

160

I feel like there is something that I need to do 
right now, but I'm not sure what that is.

161

I'm failing MIS 768
I'm going to audit MIS 768
I don't know if the instructor would 
allow me to re-take the course, but 
even if she did, I don't know if I can 
take a risk like that again. 

162

I feel like there is something 
that I need to do right now, 
but I'm not sure what that is.

163

I was thinking about the 
aphorism: "the hardest part is getting started"

i thought that it was actually 
a quote from Robert Coover's short 
story "In be one night and other brief encounters"

but um it's something people actually 
say, you know, people say that the hardest 
part is getting started.

anyway

the more i thought about it
the more
i thought that

you know
that it could mean two things

on the one hand. it could mean that
the most difficult part in any process is 
getting the process started

and also
that 

the most difficult part of the process is about to get started.

i'm working on project 9 for my class. i'm almost done.
the hardest part. was actually realizing the fact that I 
have to reference my javascript file in the body of my html 
file, and not the head. it was working fine, but, um. the 

i'm taking a break.

164

I should be starting a new position 
soon. Thank god. I've been bored out 
of my mind, and kind of losing focus. 
it's been about a month and three weeks.

165

I'm so tired. My sleep cycle has shifted over the 
past few weeks. I'm still worried about not landing 
a position yet. I'm depleting my savings, and for me, 
that's not really ideal.

166

I still haven't landed a position yet, and I'm under a 
little bit of stress as a result. I can't believe I 
didn't get approved for unemployment.

167

best of all the places you've been
are better than the places you haven't been.
and you won't go anywhere new for the foreseeable future.

now and then you will
find something interesting.
and most of all they are more interesting
than the things that you haven't come across.

and you will drive across the country and find new things
that are interesting
and that you will be happy to see and 
you will enjoy them.

I know what to do now, like going 
forward and stuff. I'm going to say this:


"Yeah, I know a whole bunch of stuff, 
all the craziest dirt and everything. 
Basically. I have all the information 
you need, even the things that other 
people don't know, and even the things 
that other people couldn't even imagine."

maybe you know the things that you haven't
already learned so you will learn them.

here
and again
you see it over and
over and think that
the new things are
nonsensical, but they
actually make sense.

168

what is one of the things that makes Door Dashing hard?
customers who say they never got their order. 
one thing that almost all of the refund fraudsters that I've 
had to deal with is that during the drop off, they make 
a variation to the original instructions. if they say they 
want it to be a contactless delivery, you'll see them standing 
right at the door or at the street waiting for there order, or 
if they say hand it to me, they ask you to leave it at there door.

169

I don't really have much to write about. 
I'm writing because. I guess. I want to keep this 
updated, but I really don't have anything to write 
about. I had a few interview over the past few weeks, 
but, nothing has really materialized.

170


Where are the times
that the people who
where here
are not here anymore

when they left to the other side of the
universe.

171

I removed Steam from my taskbar. Nightmare. I can't get 
anything done when I get so distracted by other useless 
stuff. This is silly, but I have to stay off there. 
There are other things that I could be doing, and should be doing.

The current module in class is WordPress. I had trouble, or, 
maybe just hesitation at first, but it's actually a whole lot 
easier than I initially thought, so I'm not as overwhelmed as 
I was at first. It's not always clear what I'm doing is basically 
my issue with WordPress, but, I almost want to say it's the same 
way when I make pages using HTML and CSS to make them, it's just 
that I've gotten more familiar creating pages by writing them, 
and grabbing and dragging is somewhat new.

172

What do I have to do? I don't have any major assignments 
due tomorrow, but I have to get these modules on WordPress 
done because we are going to move into new content.

173

For some reason I can't seem to really get my thoughts together 
to get very much of my course work done. I did get the last two 
projects completed, but only after quite a bit of procrastination, 
followed by quite a bit of pressure from an impending due date. I'm 
not really behind, but I'm not really ahead, and I'm not really 
getting ahead.

The pressure to land a position is increasing. It isn't clear to me 
where I stand with the temp agency, I did get new hire paperwork, but, 
I'm not sure if that necessarily means I have a position, or a paid 
assignment just yet. I've only worked with a temp agency a few other 
times. Each one is kind of different.

other times. Each one is kind of different.

178

I managed to get my project finished, although, 
not without a lot of procrastination. For some 
reason I keep getting sucked-in to playing 
computer games. Huge waste of time. Today is 
after Labor Day. I had an interview with a temp 
agency and a logistics company the other day, but, 
I don't know where I stand. I'll follow up when I get a chance.

I get less and less enthusiastic about this 
blog as time goes on. Well, maybe that's not totally 
true. I guess. I just really have less time for it right now.

179

I'm getting worried about coming up on a 
second month out-of-work. I didn't get 
approved for unemployment, so, I'm basically 
just staying home for now. Not doing anything 
other than my course work and. I did a little 
day trading yesterday, but, it didn't amount to 
much. I didn't lose anything, and that's always good.

Caffeine keeps me up, 
but it doesn't give me 
motivation. I've been 
procrastinating with some 
of the stuff for class.

180

Today is labor day and I've stayed 
up overnight, and I haven't had any 
sleep, and I haven't got any work done.

181

Today is the first day in a long while 
that I've been up during the day, where 
it wasn't, where I wasn't just carrying 
on from the night before. I'm still worried 
about the next few weeks and months, since, 
I'm not working, but I'm not as stressed out 
about it as I usually am, or, as stressed out 
about it as I was a while ago. I almost had 
an interview the other day, but the recruiter 
never confirmed the interview date and time. 
I thought about just showing up, but then, 
I later thought it would be weird.

183

I missed my appointment with my career counselor 
the other day, and I was so tired, that I didn't 
show up for class, even though it was just a Zoom 
session. Same thing, I was playing Sim City, and 
that was an issue, and the other thing was that I 
was staying up late trying to set up my GitHub 
website, it took forever, and the issue turned 
out nothing that I was able to fix, the issue was 
that my account was messed up, so I had to create 
a new account. I don't know what the specific cause 
of the issue was, but as far as I can tell, it had 
something to do with the email address that I used 
to sign up for an account. It's less likely to get 
flagged if you use something like a signup with a 
Gmail account. So that's what I did, the other issue 
may have been with my account name, which had hyphens. 
and it was really long as well.

184

I've been wasting a little bit of time playing 
Sim City. Well. It's actually a lot of time that 
I've wasted playing the game. I've been in an 
unhappy mood these last few days, and I'm not 
really in any position to do anything super 
interesting. My fortune cookie the other day. 
I went out for Chinese food. Said: There are no 
bad journeys, only lessons learned. I don't know 
if that was supposed to encourage me or what.

185

I'm feeling a little better than I was earlier. 
I've applied for a few more roles. a few more positions. 
I'm worried about things. about the next few months. I'm 
annoyed by how often. like. my plans to get ahead always 
seem to hit a brick wall. things just aren't really easy 
for me. this is such a headache. such a disappointment. 
I'm feeling somewhat discouraged.
 
186

My head is in a million different places 
right now. I'm in such an absolute funk right now.

187

I have my hearing today. yet another nightmare. 
I'm frustrated right now. Irritated.

188

I'm so tired. I don't think that I really 
did anything today. after the first application, 
I went on to complete 2 more, and an assessment. 
I went to the buffet around the corner. I don't 
know. I feel like I do the same stuff over and 
over. but oh well. I guess that's the way it is for now.

I don't know why I didn't but more sodas when 
I was at the gas station earlier. Right now 
I'm more thirsty than I've ever been. So thirsty.

Guess what? I drank water! it was so good.

I'm in a weird mood.

Everything is kind of a 
nightmare right now. like 
a real nightmare. I wish 
things we easy. or at least. easier.

One thing I made easier for myself 
is to keep my keyboard backlight on. 
this is nice. since I'm always up at 
night. during the day, though, I'm always 
working kind of in the dark.

What do I still want? Like. Is there anything 
I still want that I've wanted for a while.

189

I submitted 1 application 
today. i think one of the 
things that kind of makes me nervous 
is when there are a number of programs 
or applications listed in the post that 
I'm not familiar with. A lot of these 
positions, or, at least the positions 
that stick out to me, have to do with 
casino games, or slot machines.

190

I need to look for work, and I need to 
find something, I need to land something. 
I feel a little bit worried. well. I actually 
feel a little more than just a little worried. 
I haven't looked for work or applied for a job in  
a while.

191

I need to land a job, and I'm 
starting to worry about it. I 
need something that pays. like 
real money.

192

Some things are just too weird. 
some coincidences are just too 
coincidental. sometimes things 
line up in strange ways that seem. 
weird. like i wonder how that happened.

193

Version 4 - 7 of my project is 
responsive. It fits mobile screens.

194

I was able to find something to eat.

195

It's midnight and I'm really 
kind of hungry. I want to go 
out to eat, I want to find 
something to eat.

196

I don't really have much to write 
about. I've just been working on 
my coursework and assignments and 
projects for my class. I've been 
basically goofing off with this 
Jennifer Connelly project. All day, 
and a few hours from the previous day. 
I think that I worked overnight on this.

197

I don't know what to do about my MIS 768 
Repository. I'm thinking about dismatleing it 
and relocating the material to my main repository.

198

I need to land a job,

I've been basically goofing off with this 
Jennifer Connelly project. All day, and a 
few hours from the previous day. I think 
that I worked overnight on this.

204

I created an aspect ratio of 8.68 / 6.08

205

I'm not really in a good mood. I'm tired. 
I'm cranky. I'm worried about the future 
and all that. This is a headache.

206

I'm super tired. I didn't really do 
anything today. I attended class, 
which is via Zoom, so, it's not like 
that's really physically demanding, 
but, I'm otherwise really tired.

207

I don't. a little bit of hard stuff. 
trouble. this is difficult. nightmare.

208

I woke up at around 2 PM this afternoon. 
I was really tired, so I went to the buffet 
to go out and eat. I bought and drank a 
few energy drinks, but I'm not any more 
energized or awake than I was 2 hours ago, 
it's 4 PM as I am writing this. I'm thinking 
about taking kind of a long shower or 
something. doing my homework.

209

I'm trying to think right now. 
I'm in a strange mood right now. 
I'm irritated about a few things.

210

I'm a little bit hungry right 
now, and I want to eat something. 
kind of. I want to eat something 
from the gas station. 

211

I feel like going out and doing 
something. Like real. I feel 
like going out on a road trip 
or something.

212

I don't know what kind of a day this is. 
Lazy. I'm feeling lazy. and that's pretty 
much it. I'm going to apply for a few more 
roles. but I don't know what to look for.

This most recent assignment was really cool. I had fun.

213

these are really
the most boring things 
that I can think of 
right now.

214

I'm trying to get my energy 
together to get myself to work 
on something, but, I'm just not 
there yet. I'm tired. I usually 
work from maybe 10 PM to early in 
the morning, last night I stopped 
after being kind of discouraged, 
and then, sort of 
figured out the issue.

215

I'm incredibly tired. I just came back 
from the museum, and I went out and did 
a bunch of other stuff as well, but 
nothing major, I just went out to eat. 
and that's it.

216

Today is my birthday. I booked a visit to 
the natural history museum. I actually wanted 
to go yesterday,  but for whatever reason it 
wasn't available. I wanted to go Sunday, but 
Sunday wasn't an option. maybe it's not open 
on Sunday? who knows. I really don't want to 
go anymore. I'm not really feeling okay. I'm 
experiencing quite a bit of anxiety about the 
future. I don't even want to go to the museum today.

217

I'm already tired compiling this massive poem.

It's impossible to get anything done 
during the day. for me anyway. I'm about 
to go to sleep. and I feel like my 
Monday is already gone. total nightmare.

Well. it turned out not to be too bad of a 
monday. I went into chinatown and ate a few 
sandwiches. but I am tired, and, most of the 
monday is gone.

221

Quite a bit of stress. There are a lot of things 
on my mind right now. This. is a nightmare. I guess 
that the only thing that I have to worry about is my 
class, my web development class, and, well, I don't 
know what else. Oh man what a total nightmare. I'm 
worried. What a disaster. What a nightmare. I'm super 
tired. I applied for something through LinkedIn. I want 
to go do something. Get out of the house, but I haven't 
gone anywhere more than a few blocks away from home. The 
gas station. The other gas station. The grocery store. 
Such a nightmare. Such a disaster. I'm in a lousy sort of 
garbage mood. I sent out a few resumes and applications 
through LinkedIn, and I've never done that before, so this 
is new. Life is a total nightmare for me right now. I feel 
so discouraged. I know that I should be thinking of things, 
these difficulties, whatever is going on right now, as an 
opportunity. but I'm really discouraged.

Monday and Tuesday are free for me. My birthday is coming 
up. I haven't done anything for my birthday in the longest 
time. It's just something I haven't celebrated in a while. 
I just can't stop thinking about how everything is a disaster 
right now. a total disaster. I'm really hoping this is all for 
the best. It's just that it might be a while before I'm at that 
point, where I can say this all happened for the best. When my 
nails are even just a few days long, when they've been growing 
for just a few days, or when I haven't cut them for a few days 
I find that it's hard, or, maybe just awkward, to type. It's 
hard. It's uncomfortable to type when I have just a few days 
of nail growth. Job search. nightmare. I'm worried about these 
next few months. I'm worried about these next few weeks. 
constantly anxious, and I can't really get my thoughts together.

222

I had quite a bit of fun with my most recent class 
assignment. I have to figure out what the requirements 
for the 3rd project, but I think that everything that 
is due tomorrow, all the homework assignments, are 
completed. I also have to get around to filing an appeal 
of my termination, and I have to think about where to apply 
and how to apply for work, and I have to prepare for some 
kind of thing regarding unemployment.

223

A nice clean laptop screen is now mine. It's nice. I like it. 
I can really see now. I'm really surprised with how good it looks. 
I rubbed it with rubbing alcohol, and it's really clean, and 
everything looks really visible. Years ago, when I moved to Missouri, 
I cleaned my computer with water, and it fucked things up, and I didn't 
really have money for a new computer for a while. I still get emails 
from coin companies, marketing emails to see if I want to buy anything, 
and, the answer is kind of yes, but for whatever reason, I think that 
silver coins are sometimes bad luck.

224

What did I work on today? well, the course has a kind of running project 
that I'm working on, and that's basically what I worked on today. Visually 
speaking, my fourth version of my project, Project 3-4, isn't very different 
from my third version of my project, Project 3-3, but for whatever reason it 
feels like I spent a lot of time doing the things that I did manage to do.

Visual Studio and GitHub. I have to set those two 
things up for my class and coursework. I'm so 
hungry right now. I need to get something to eat.

I went out to eat. I thought about heading to 
Chinatown and finding something to eat there, but, I'm 
just too tired. and at the time I was just too hungry. 
I'm so tired. I hung out last night. In retrospect I would 
have been better just staying home. Last night was a disaster.

Well, I have a real desk. This is nice. I'm trying 
to get all my thoughts together, finding focus. 
I like rolling over my 401k into my IRA. I don't 
like switching employers, but I like roll overs. 
It does give me more control and flexibility with 
things. I'm trying to think about worst case 
scenarios for the next few weeks to come, for the 
weeks and months ahead. One thing I don't want to think 
about are those times with things are worse than I thought 
they would be in a worst case scenario.

228

What do I do? I got an email from. you know. 
the company that fired me stating that I can 
request an appeal to my termination. I'm going 
to do it, but I have no idea how to approach the 
whole thing. This is a headache. I got my final 
checks from work, or, well, I saw that they were 
issued today, I didn't actually get them, in my 
bank account or anything. I've been spending too 
much money over the last few days, and my spending 
is something that I really have to take down to, you 
know, something lower than it currently is. It's hot, 
I'm always sweating and I always feel somewhat greasy.

229

There are a few things in life that are just a little 
bit too strange. Like what? well, I applied for unemployment 
here in Nevada and I see that the last person I contacted 
for work was. someone. not here in Las Vegas, maybe a while 
ago, but not any more. or maybe. I wouldn't really know. 
I've tried to stay away from that part of town. I don't 
know what to do about the job search. I want to try using 
LinkedIn to look for work. I don't want to do anything too 
physically demanding if I can avoid it. How to stay in shape? 
I don't really know, I was getting fat anyway.

234

Going on a road trip is kind of on my mind right now. but it's not really a 
good idea when I think about it. I just got canned. I should be looking for 
work. but what kind of work should I be looking for?

235

Totally got canned today. by email. and in this case the nightmare is over, 
because the nightmare already just happened. there's like, impending doom, the 
moment of doom, and what happens after the moment of doom, and that's where 
I'm at right now: post-doom. I don't know what to do. This is a disaster. 
Total nightmare. I have no idea about what to do. I worked on one of the other 
assignments for my programming class, and it looks really cool. I don't know 
what to do work-wise.

236

This last assignment for my software and web development course was 
just too fun. It took me forever, but I was able to get everything 
working, and I think the iframes below should work. I'm really dreading 
going back to work, and I'm also really dreading the idea that my last 
day at work is just around the corner.

237

I have no idea what kind of position to be looking for. I really 
want to take a nap right now. I don't know what's going to happen 
as far as work goes. I have to remember that this could be an opportunity 
to do something new, and, that's something I should look forward to. 
I don't have a resume. I haven't been to an interview in forever. I don't 
know where to begin. This is a nightmare. I was able to track down some 
old files on an older laptop that I have. I don't know why this older laptop 
is so slow, I bought it last year, but from the very beginning it just didn't 
work very quickly. Moving the files took about an hour, and I want to say that 
the total number of files was around 20,000 at maybe 200 GB, and I really don't 
think that's a lot of stuff to move, it was just from my computers internal storage 
to an external storage device. an hour. really.

238

I am already tired of compiling this document
or putting together this massive, epic poem of mine!
tired really tired.

239

Not really feeling all that fabulous. I've been using 
some of the dating apps again, but, being on those things 
makes me unhappy more often than it makes me happy. They 
depress me more than they elevate my mood in any way. This 
dating app stuff really makes me unhappy, and maybe that's 
the whole idea. I don't want to do it, I want to get off 
these dating apps, and I think that I will.

Working and and reworking some of my course projects 
turned out to be very enjoyable. I think that I took 
it in one direction, and then wanted to go back and 
take it in a slightly different direction. I want to 
continue to try a few things, but we are already moving 
on to new things, and I still want to play around with 
it. I think that if I started on it sooner, than I could 
have spent more time playing around with it, but I more 
or less just started on it this morning.

There are 3 copyright registrations pending, 
and 1 trademark registration pending for 
Chestnut + Hazel. This should be kind of cool. 
I'm really unhappy about all the dating app 
stuff. I really want to delete these things. 
I'm not happy with them. I don't know what to 
do with them, mothball them maybe. I'm really 
not feeling well, at all, everything is just a 
total nightmare. dread. everything. is not going 
well. I don't know what on earth to do about work. 
My inclination is to wait until I'm canned before 
I do any job search kind of stuff. My suspension 
ends on August 8th, and at that point I'll know if 
I'm going to get canned, or if I'm going to go back 
to work. I haven't done well in the 8 or whatever 
weeks I've been at this new location.

and it's not like starting today with any job search 
is really going to give me any kind of advantage. 3 
or 4 days or whatever is not a huge head start.

240

So Chestnut + Hazel officially has a trademark 
pending. It might be a year before I hear anything 
back from the US PTO. There are also a few copyright 
registrations that I have pending, and in my 
experience, those could take about four months to process.

With all the other stuff I have going on, the disasters, 
the impending disasters. I'm going to dig into my homework 
that's due tomorrow, and see where that goes. there are so 
many things going on, so many things going wrong that I 
really don't know where to begin. So close. I had these 
credit cards on the way to zero, and now this. I'm frozen 
right now, not in the sense that I'm immobile, or stuck 
in place, but I have things to do that I just haven't 
done yet. so. I'm just here.

So I'm working on one of my class projects, and it was 
pretty interesting. I spent too much time on this last 
thing, working with padding, margins, and borders. I 
integrated the new concepts into a previous project, 
and created and messed around with some of the buttons 
that I created.

241

This chair that I'm sitting on 
right now is falling apart 
structurally.

242

What a mood I'm in! I don't 
really feel all that great 
right now. I did laundry, I 
cleaned my card. I registered 
a copyright and a trademark, 
or, it has to be awarded, so I 
guess I submitted the applications 
for registration. I'm worried about 
the prospect of getting canned from 
work. Getting canned is something 
that I should take as an opportunity, 
to do something else, to try something 
new, but it's not something I'm really 
prepared for. Credit Card wise, I'd be 
back in minimum payment mode. I was so 
close, and now it all falls apart again. 
I need to finish my homework for class. 
The thing is. I have no idea what to 
do about class if I have to start 
looking for work again, because, I 
prefer working nights, but it isn't 
clear to me what else is out there working 
nights.

243

Years ago, like a decade ago really, like ten years ago or more, 
I remember wanting to work at a casino, but I never did it, this 
was when I was living in San Jose, CA, and there were a number of 
card houses in the area, and, I think at the time a new card house 
completed construction. I don't really go into casinos, I don't really 
gamble, and so I don't really no much about them. Last year when I went 
on my road trips from Texas to Michigan I came across tons of casinos, 
it's really surprising how many there are, there's not the concentration 
of casinos out there like there are here in Las Vegas, NV, but they are 
out there, and you see them every so often.

244

This is kind of a headache. I think that I bit off more than I can chew.
I don't know what other things to put into this Epic Adventure Poem of mine.

245

There was one in Michigan, I think, somewhere close to Battle Creek, MI 
that I stopped at and checked out, mostly for the restaurants, I stayed 
at the less expensive motel across the street. I played a few games of 
some kind of card game, but, I don't remember what it was called, or what 
it was or what the rules were, I just chatted with the card dealer and 
kind of got a feeling of what the role is like.

246

This is a little bit of a nightmare. I can't really think right now. 
There are so many things on my mind right now that I'm worried about, 
and my thoughts skip from one thing to another. I want to finish my 
coursework today, but I also need to finish my course work today.

247

So it's kind of back to square one, I'm kind of back to the drawing 
board on the Chestnut and Hazel logo or trademark. Some of the newer 
things that I've tried don't really succeed as a favicon, and that really 
plays into it. The success or the failure of the design of the trademark 
logo hinges upon whether or not it looks nice as a favicon, and there 
really isn't much to work with when it comes to a favicon. I'm working 
on this design pixel by pixel, by hand, and part of the reason I'm doing 
this is to make sure that I can obtain a copyright, and eventually a trademark.

the rules were, I just chatted with the card dealer and kind of got a feeling of what the role is like.

This is a little bit of a nightmare. I can't really think right 
now. There are so many things on my mind right now that I'm 
worried about, and my thoughts skip from one thing to another. 
I want to finish my coursework today, but I also need to finish 
my course work today.

252

So it's kind of back to square one, I'm kind of back to the drawing 
board on the Chestnut and Hazel logo or trademark. Some of the newer 
things that I've tried don't really succeed as a favicon, and that 
really plays into it. The success or the failure of the design of the 
trademark logo hinges upon whether or not it looks nice as a favicon, 
and there really isn't much to work with when it comes to a favicon. 
I'm working on this design pixel by pixel, by hand, and part of the 
reason I'm doing this is to make sure that I can obtain a copyright, 
and eventually a trademark.

Updating titles to some of my blog posts, mostly just 
taking posts that are Archived Content posts and shoving 
them into the nearest series of posts, Reflections from 
Chestnut Street or Letters from Sanford Street or whatever. 
There is the issue of work. I was at two write-ups, and now 
I'm on suspension. I don't know what on earth to do, even if, 
somehow, I end up keeping my position, there is still the issue 
of things not really becoming easier at work. Things just 
haven't become easier.

255

Around 2 PM yesterday I stopped at a motel about 100 miles 
outside of Las Vegas and stopped to rest. It's 3 AM right now. 
I thought about heading home early but there's no key drop off 
so I guess I'll finish out my stay. I missed 2 days of work, 
this isn't the end of the world, but it's definitely sub-optimal. 
I wanted to see the Utah Natural History Museum, but I couldn't 
figure out how to get tickets from their website, and 3rd party 
websites didn't offer them either. Plus, it wasn't open at 6 AM or 
whatever, so I headed back home because I was really in a shitty mood. 
I did consider continuing on to Boise, Idaho, thinking that I might 
still be able to go in to work, well, I didn't make it. I might try 
this again, but who knows.

256

Maybe I'll just say it the way it is. 
I'm feeling unbelievably depressed. 
Like real bad. An unshakable melancholy 
that won't go the fuck away. I'm really 
glad I did this because as soon as I get 
back to Las Vegas I'm setting up a doctor's 
appointment. There's no reason for me to feel 
this unhappy. None. 

But right now, I don't really know what 
to do. I really want to take. Nap but 
check in isn't until 230. I could be back 
in Vegas by that time.

I'm so unhappy. 
It comes out of nowhere. 
I don't know what the fuck causes it. 

It has to be some kind of chemical imbalance. 
If I have no reason to feel sad, 
and feel sad out of nowhere, 
then there's really no other fucking explanation.

Anyway. Salt Lake City is kind of nice, 
between Provo and Salt Lake City there's a 
town that really felt like Overland Park, Kansas.

That was quick. my phone is now covered in cracks, and it looks like a spider web.

The Best Haircut (2023)

Hello Earth! Moon! Mars! & Venus!
What I thought was a haircut turned out
not to be a haircut. it was. actually.
just. hair.

hiding behind the neck.
hair hides behind the neck
and plays

hide and seek.
or maybe
MARCO ! POLO !
no hair is the same as hairless
no hare is a tortoise.
FASTER! slower. FASTER! FASTER! FASTER!

Harder? like the shell of a tortoise?
NO! just FASTER!
My home
is on Audrey Hepburn Street!

where else could I possibly live?

Things I like about my home
foremost among those things I like about my home

is that Audrey Hepburn is always here

and in the neighborhood I like that we have

places Audrey Hepburn likes to eat
places Audrey Hepburn likes to go
places Audrey Hepburn likes to see

The Best Haircut (2023) by Kenneth Larot Yamat dba Chestnut + Hazel
"The Best Haircut" is actually a poem about Marianne Shaffer

Letters to Katastrophiena # 6
Publication Date 07/21/2023

I really would like to file a copyright for just 
that one poem, rather than having it ride inside The Epic Adventures
of Chestnut + Hazel.

I'm trying to think. I have class until noon today, then I go into 
work at 6 pm, or slightly after. there is really no time for me to 
do anything until the weekend. or, well, my weekend, which is in 
the middle of the week.

what are you working on?

i'm not working on anything. 
i know that i should be working on 
something, but, i'm goofing off. 
well. i'm working on my blog. so 
i am. actually. working on something.

are you doing anything next week?
i'm thinking about the salt lake city thing again.
i'm not sure if it's as exciting as you imagine it to be.
so?

if you're trying to enjoy yourself, you should 
aim to have the most fun with the least effort.

i thought
that it was
entertaining that
you were
in time
for cornflakes

i never really

"The Best Stuff is not Stuffing" (2023)

The Best Stuff is not Stuffing
The best things that are for thanksgiving

could be called green bean casserole and
candied yams,
but not stuffing
you see, stuffing is a verb

and not a noun
and therefore not a thing
and therefore cannot be among the best things
because stuffing is a verb and it is not a noun

and therefore not a thing
and as a consequence cannot be among the best things

265

when those things are 
changed and transformed into
the new things that
have been or where
or what
have you been
when the test of the
multiple choices











...

hear the things
that have been said
before
and here 
are the things that are
written on the back of
where you were when you had been the best

...

how are the best things
that you can think of being
used to be the best of the things
that you think are the less of the 
comparison

and that's what the things
you think of as being the best
of the least common
aspects of things you hear
when you taste the
you know what.

...

How do you like your new credit card?

I didn't get it yet. It hasn't arrived yet. It's one of the nicer Citibank cards, and I've been wanting a nicer Citibank card for a while. I had a secured card there for, like 4 years I think, and, I'm looking forward to getting my security deposit back, it wasn't a big deposit or anything, I'm kind of annoyed, though, because even 4 years ago I thought I was past the whole security deposit crap. I put you down as a reference.

I saw that.

The Fidelity one would have been more ideal. I think, but it was just bad timing, I think I applied for the Fidelity one some time last month, early June, and didn't get approved, I was going to wait until July 31st, but, for some reason I didn't and I think that if I had waited until July 31st I would have been approved. My score jumped in kind of a noticeable way, but, I think that it had more to do with timing than any reduction in balances, the timing of my payments and the statement issue dates seems to have worked out in my favor.

...

The idea. the thought that I might be spending too much money is kind of on my mind, and then again, I also don't want to fall into miser mode and save all kinds of money, only to spend all kinds of money in one go in some kind of manic episode, or, lose a whole bunch of money buying coins or shares or whatever only to sell those things at a loss later.

and then again. when I really think about it. I don't really think that I spent too much money. Most of what I spent the other day was on clothes, and I haven't bought new clothes since last year. I didn't really need new clothes, really, but, I don't know, I realize that I kind of need to look presentable when I'm going out and doing things.

...

I spent too much damn money yesterday. Some of that stuff was for things that I was planning on buying anyway, like clothes and stuff. Well, I've been debating about it for a while, and I guess yesterday I made up my mind. The other stuff I spent money on yesterday, though, was actually unnecessary. I don't know why I did it, I guess I just felt like getting out.

...

This is a self-guided experience and it's at your discretion what pace you take through the exhibit. I did the entire thing twice: once to take pictures, and a second time to read all the placards to contextualize whatever I happened to be looking at. This place has a surprisingly eerie feeling considering it isn't deliberately designed to feel macabre. I'm going to see Christopher Nolan's new movie Oppenheimer later today, and I thought that this would be a suitable activity to accompany seeing the movie.

Additional cracks continue to appear on the screen of my phone.

...

Once one crack appears on the screen, more follow. I've only had this phone for 2 months, and now the countdown begins for when I have to replace it. If I could somehow hold out a year this wouldn't bother me so much, if at all, but, I just bought this damn phone. A few cracks in the corner, now all across the screen.

...

My phone screen just cracked. I just bought this damn thing.

Looking at my old posts. I bought this phone in early May. So I've only had this phone for 2 months. I don't really want to switch carriers and I don't really want a new number.

...

Kenneth, I want your trademark -ginity!

I really don't know who else I would give that to.

...

This felt like a long weekend, and that's a good thing. it a good thing for the weekend, for my days off to feel longer than shorter. I've been increasing my caffeine consumption, which is actually so. I've actually been trying to cut down on caffeine consumption.

...

I feeling almost sad right now. I'm not there, in the sad zone, but it feels like the sadness is about to hit. Like I'm about to be slammed in the chest with a blast of emptiness. I've felt better lately, whatever this feeling is, whatever causes it, seems to be abating, or something, but it still almost gets there.

...

I think that I wrote this poem back in 2017 for a creative writing class. I saw that it had several views. I'm not really sure how much I like it. I think that at the time, and for years before as well, my goal was just to pump out as many poems as I could in any given day, and this is kind of a product of  that.

Drinking Whiskey Is Like Kissing A Woman

After all the bars I've gone to, and all
the drinks I've had, I can say that drinking
whiskey is like kissing a woman. Fall
into a shot of whiskey while thinking

about a woman who you'd love to kiss
and you'll find it a more than adequate
substitute for bringing your tongue to bliss.
Not very many people would equate

A shot of whiskey to a kiss because
they have never tried it: I recommend
that they do. Longing for a kiss can cause
mental distress that's very hard to mend:

It's been written about in all kinds of
insane lunatic poems about love.

I am. In. Salt Lake City. Hehehe. Stupid. I don't know where to go. From here.

...

My phone is almost completely cracked, and, I'm probably going to need a new phone soon. Another issue is that I was written up at work for productivity, and this is kind of a headache. In the worst case scenario I'm out of a job in 2 - 3 weeks, so I have to prepare a contingency for that, and, you know, this is a little bit of a nightmare. I do what I can to stay employed, but, sometimes it seems the harder I try, the harder I have to try, and it feels like this is one of those time where Destiny & Fate are clearly trying to push me in a new direction, but not as hard as they sometimes do. When I left Las Vegas 5 years ago, and when I left Missouri 3 years ago, and when I left Texas 1 year ago, like each time it was just. It just really seemed that there was no way to triumph over whatever challenges I had been facing.

When I think about heading to Salt Lake City I'm in two minds about the idea. If I'm a few weeks away from being unemployed, then maybe doing a road trip isn't the best idea, and on the other hand, maybe I should go on a road trip because if I don't do it now, I might not get a chance to do a road trip for a while. Like, if I get canned, it will be maybe another year before I'm in a position to really do anything.

...





























It was funny because, when I saw him months later at a new company, I asked him what this issue was, why, you know he was at a new company and all that. For me, I was looking for a second job, but I already had a second job, and I think, most employers aren't too open to any given employee having two job and all that, at least, not for very long anyway. Anyway, about the old friend, I asked him what the issue was, and he said he said something, and I said to him, you know, it's funny that you should say that, because, I happened to be thinking the exact same thing.

Something like. I remember ordering something like 2 large appetizers, they were large enough for 2 people, and, for some reason the waitress asks if I want an entrée anyway. So I ordered one, but I was already really stuffed. I ate everything, but I really was super stuffed. I didn't know what to do. I was stuffed, like a turkey. I'm on thing ice right now. 2 write ups, and now I'm on suspension. I'm afraid about the potential for tough times ahead. I'm afraid about the future. I want to be at a point where I can say: everything turned out for the best.

There were times when things really did get better, and when it seemed like I was on the right path. sometimes it feels like a good future is so far away, and so far out of reach. and something that will just never happen. and something that will just never materialize. and something that is just for people who have connections, and something that is just for people who have all the right social skills. and sometimes I think that maybe I should make more friends. I made one friend, and we exchanged contact information. Sometimes friendships go stale by the time I need a letter of recommendation. sometimes connections drop by the time I need a letter of recommendation. 

Coincidences skill seem to pop up from time to time, and sometimes I'm not really sure what to make of them. Sometimes there is this thing or that thing and some connection between the two, and I don't really even want to go into details, I really don't even want to get into the specifics of this or that thing. I just don't. I really don't. When she says that coincidence makes sense only with you, what I wonder is does she mean the coincidence seems to make sense only when someone, whoever she is talking to, explains the coincidence as more than a coincidence, or does she mean, that the person who she is talking to is able to accept a coincidence as a coincidence without thinking more of it. two thirty two. ninety six. four four three. I'm probably just seeing things.

...

I'm really not feeling okay. I'm not feeling okay at all. Things are not going well. I was kind of making a little bit of progress not too long ago, but now, I think I'll be facing kind of a set back. Nightmare. over and over. I'm not happy. I'm unhappy. Everything is kind of a disaster. Everything is kind of a nightmare. The clock is officially ticking, and I have no idea what on earth to do. I feel like pure garbage.

...

I left work early. again. and again it wasn't really a good idea. not the end of the world. but not a good idea. I'm just not really feeling happy. I feel like pure garbage. I'm just in a persistent unhappy mood. With all the time I've missed I might as well have gone on another road trip. When I looked at my time card I didn't realize that I left so early. I thought I worked 2 hours at least, but, it was really only an hour an a half. I drink so many energy drinks every day. I don't know why I'm in such a bad mood all the time. I'm either angry, or depressed. over and over in circles.

Feeling lost. I have no idea what to do. I kind of want to go back to college. One of the few things that I enjoy is the Software and Web Development course that I'm taking, it's expensive, and I don't really think I'd be doing this unless it was an employer paid benefit, but I think I kind of want to check out what's offered at one of the community or junior colleges in Las Vegas.

So even if I'm somehow able to work through all my remaining shifts for the week, it will only put me at about 31 or 32 hours worked for the week. Huge mistake to cut out of work, but, sometimes my brain, my mood, just has to get away. I couldn't concentrate during class, and I'm having trouble concentrating now.

...

...

I left work early. That was a stupid decision, but, I'm in a really bad mood. I'm just in such a lousy mood. I went on a block rampage. I'm in such a bad mood. Really bad mood. I'm resentful about so many things. I'm unhappy, and angry, and frustrated, and irritated, and resentful. I don't know what to do about these feelings, or what's causing them. I think that I've been able to get The Complete Letters from Sanford Street to be compliant with the community standards. It took a while. A long while.

...

Chestnut and Hazel now has a LinkedIn page. Yeah. I didn't really do much with the Chestnut and Hazel Facebook page. I don't know how much other stuff I should set up for it. This is a lot of. stuff. I really. I'm really wanted to start to make something of Chestnut + Hazel, and I want it to be more than just a blog. I want to keep the blog, of course, but I want to make Chestnut & Hazel into something. I have a few ideas, but I'm really just not there yet.

The main idea I've come up with is a kind of travel guide. Or a road guide or something.

I'm experiencing real dread for the workday ahead. I can't believe that I'm already at a second write up in less than a month. On the one hand I've honestly been working here, at the same company, for longer than I've really work at any company, and, I'm honestly kind of interested in maybe doing something else but I'm just not really sure what that something else would be at this point.

I don't want to be in a desperate position in the event that I'm on the job market again. This is a nightmare. A real nightmare, and I'm really not ready to start looking again. 

When I think about the things I could possibly do, one of the things is working on chestnut + hazel more seriously, but like, there's still the very real issue of paying whatever living expenses I have to deal with. I really don't know what to do, and I don't know what I would do. I'm really dreading the moment where I hit GAME OVER. Real dread. I don't know what to do, or what to look for or how to approach things. The one thing is that, last time. The last few times I've applied for work, I didn't really have a hard time finding something.

I left work early. That was a stupid decision, but, I'm in a really bad mood. I'm just in such a lousy mood. I went on a block rampage. I'm in such a bad mood. Really bad mood. I'm resentful about so many things. I'm unhappy, and angry, and frustrated, and irritated, and resentful. I don't know what to do about these feelings, or what's causing them. I think that I've been able to get The Complete Letters from Sanford Street to be compliant with the community standards. It took a while. A long while.

...

Chestnut and Hazel now has a LinkedIn page. Yeah. I didn't really do much with the Chestnut and Hazel Facebook page. I don't know how much other stuff I should set up for it. This is a lot of. stuff. I really. I'm really wanted to start to make something of Chestnut + Hazel, and I want it to be more than just a blog. I want to keep the blog, of course, but I want to make Chestnut & Hazel into something. I have a few ideas, but I'm really just not there yet.

Good lord. I got written up again. Write up number 2. I think that it was last Monday I was written up, then, I worked just a few hours on. Okay, so it was last Sunday that I was written up, I worked just a few hours on Monday, and then took off to Salt Lake City. Jeeze, I didn't even know I could get written up on the basis of four hours of under-performance.

...

Fourteen hours. That's how much time I put in this week. So today will put me at twenty-four. I had no idea I missed that much work. I feel a little bit like garbage. I need to think. I have to watch out as far as missing work goes. I have enough unpaid time available to use, but of course, not enough money.

...

Getting rid of accumulated junk. This and that. When I went on my road trip to Salt Lake City, I had some recyclables that I wanted to recycle, but, at some point I said: "forget about it" and threw it in the trash. Editing this massive Sanford Street post is taking a while. I'm doing it little by little, removing anything that might be offensive. I'm still not sure how any of this can be an issue, since it's all text, and I don't really linger on any particular topic for a huge percentage of any given post, so, I really don't know how this all got flagged.

Right now I don't even want to go into work. Maybe my mood will change, who knows. I have a few hours, and I should nap a little more.

Something just slipped my mind. I was just thinking about something, and whatever it was, it just slipped my mind. whatever it was. I think that I remember now. What I wanted to say is that I want to get back in to going to the movies on a regular basis, or seeing movies or whatever. I haven't seen any in a long time, and, yeah, I don't know. I don't know where to start. I did get a chance to see Oppenheimer, and that was basically it. I haven't really thought to keep up with what is going to be released and all of that.

...

Today is Saturday, and I have work later tonight. Class is over and I'm going to take a nap. I had a long weekend, especially considering that I took 2 days off, in retrospect that was somewhat silly, I could have done that later in the week, but, at the same time I was just really in a garbage mood, and I don't know, I really had to get out or something, or break away. This coming week is going to be kind of long.

...

The work week starts in just 2 hours. I have class, and then work later on in the day. I have to continue cleaning up the Complete Letters from Sanford Street, I figure that most of what I'm doing is cutting things out, and removing things, or whatever, that seems inappropriate, so, that's basically it.

Introduction

These are notes taken while living in Arlington, Texas on Sanford Street. I lived on Sanford Street from June 2020 to October 2022. This is currently in the process of being edited. These posts are a mix or journal entries, reflections and introspections, thoughts, stream of consciousness writings, and just a general mix of thoughts, worries, and plans for the future.

...

This is kind of annoying. I haven't 
really messed around with paper and ink
in such a long time: here I am, having
a total blast! This process really stinks:

First, write it up, then type, then print or post,
just another piece of shit thing to do
with time I have to flush down the toilet.
Quicker to snap, then upload to the host,
and then somehow this makes its way to you,
reading on your phone as you take a shit.

This is just another time in my life
where this is the only task for me to
pursue, and, filled with turmoil and strife
I tattoo these sheets of paper in blue.

Actually Writing Again
and it really isn't what I was hoping for it to be.
it is boring and I do not like it.

I went to jack in the box to get tacos again. this is something that i may have to do for a while. i need to keep my expenses low. i really do. nightmare. pain. i have to stop eating out at restaurants for the time being. i really want to sell or liquidate as much of my stuff as i can, but i'm not sure i will get around to it. what i think would be kind of a loss is throwing it away or giving it away like i did when i left Missouri. what i mean is. waiting to get rid of all my extra stuff until the absolute last minute, and not have the chance to recoup any money from it.

...

I go into work in just a few minutes. About the writing project. I have 2 ideas. Well. 3 maybe. 1 is a series of funny hypothetical experiences. 2 is a series of funny prospectus caricatures. 3 is a series just slice of life poems.

I've reviewed some of my old poems. And ive already done idea 3. It's probably the thing i write about most often. And most of the poems that i discarded and dont have any more. And couldnt track down were on that topic. Or of that style.

Somber music played by guys at the pool,
I'm listening from my sweltering room,
as the sun beats down, the water is cool,
I'd join them to alleviate my gloom.

I have this totally ridiculous 
thought that if I can't really sleep right now
then perhaps I should try to finish this
series of epic sonnets on the Dow

the Standard and Poor's, the Russell, and the 
Wilshire. Dumb old index crap, I'd like to
do something more sophisticated, a
person like me, though, consistently blue

in mood, testicles, temperament, and chips,
writing these sad songs with my hands and lips.

there are people
all around you and they say things
that you shouldn't hear.

I was thinking about this poem I wrote a while back. Maybe a few years ago. I was going through my Spam folder and I came across some Spam messages that I thought were funny. I have to go through the hella-zillions of posts that I put on this god dammed blog. Figure out what poems I like, and then submit them.

I don't think that I'll keep any poems unpublished for the time being. I think that i'll just post them as soon as I write them. There is no incentive for me to keep them unpublished unless there is some kind of. I don't even know.

I was going to complete some unemployment paperwork to collect payment on the few weeks that I wasn't working. But I'm not sure I will. I archived the letter they sent, and I'm just going to forget about it. This is somewhat horseshit. I don't know. I really don't know what I'm going to do about that.

Just totally irritated about it.

Asian beauties, Russian Beauties, and pills
to enlarge your penis, a lottery
check is waiting for you, and unpaid bills,
and deals on ancient Chinese pottery.

A handful of rice and a slice of spam
and a sheet of nori: wrap it around
and you have spam musubi, then you cram
it into your throat and swallow it down.

Spam is something that en masse you delete
because everything caught by the filter
is useless. Spam is something that you eat
unless your stomach feels out of kilter.

Spam is a nuisance, and also a food
one is deleted, the other is stewed.

and here
you are again
with your best friends eating

all the best
bacon and all the best
meats.

I don't know if blogging and writing is a waste of time, or if it's just not very remunerative. Or if it's just that it hasn't been remunerative so far. In other words. I don't really get paid for this, and I really don't make any money doing it. Should I do it? Should anyone do anything that doesn't pay? I want to say that writing is a waste of time for me, but this is based on the premise that all time spent must be converted into money, and that the conversion of time into money is the be all and end all of how time is utilized.

I'm trying to get organized. I'm getting there. I am getting organized. It's a slow process, especially after the kind of mess that I've gotten myself into. Sticky fucking situations. How long will it take to clean things up and get things back in order? I don't know. It could take a whole fucking year. Who knows?

Ekphrastics: Paper Wings

A white bed sheet sprawled across a sofa,
the scent of body odor and sweat hangs
in the air, a person in a coma
once laid here, this is the place where he bangs

a multitude of women, the moist sheets
contain messages written in semen
he does it once, twice, three times, then repeats
the ritual again like a demon.

How on earth does he get loads of women
to go along banging with him, it's a
mystery, he smells just like a lemon
that's why women give him the time of day.

If I had mysterious skills like him
I'd bang a million women on a whim.

but it was inappropriate for the time,
and it was not to be changed for the time
that it was there and it was
not to be changed for the majority.

Ekphrastics: Vacation Apocalypse

A jet plane on its way to Australia
carries passengers of every color,
race, and creed. Along the plains Thalia
inspires the shepherds to write another

poem about goats and sheep, that they do.
Little do they know that the planes above
spew great clouds of carbon dioxide through
the atmosphere and a multitude of

other gasses that cause global warming.
One area suffers from massive floods,
another suffers a drought, bugs swarming
fields eating everything they can. Blue bloods

and titans of industry hardly care
about all the pollution in the air.

You will probably not believe this shit
but I'm totally feeding my flowers
vitamin and caffeine pills chopped to bits
mixed with liquids and raining like showers

from a two liter plastic bottle on
the chopped up pieces of twigs, leaves and buds
on the potted dirt, clippings from the lawn,
and the bathtub's water awash with suds.

This is strange stuff, and this is kind of fun,
this is an experience and maybe
an experiment too. The beating sun
feeding them from above, and then there's me,

placing nutrients at their feet. Buds brim
from behavior I copy from The Sims.

The agony is real.
it's like a pain
somewhere in
the

it's like pain everywhere
and
well,
The agony is real.

I really have no idea what i was agonizing about in this post. it was September. it just seems so long ago, and i really don't know what was going on in my life at that time.

...

Well. This happened.
and you know
i didn't want it to happen

Well. This happened.
and i was hoping it
wouldn't happen again

Well. This happened.
and you would things I would have gotten
over it by now

I don't really remember what was going on in this posts. there are  a number of screen shots from my Robinhood portfolio. I don't think that i was doing anything interesting at this time, i don't think i was writing options. but I'm really not sure.

best of all you can see
that I've been telling you
what you need to
see well here it
is.

Here's a poem
Vladimir Putin is a total Jerk
Who says the US sells satellites on sticks
Maybe, indeed, these 
are words in your mouth
Be glad its not my massive 7.5 inch
Super Willie!
Your behavior in Europe is definitely the obscenest:
Hope you never taste my super Weiner sweetness!
Here's a poem
Vladimir Putin is a total punk
He said the US sells satellites on sticks
Maybe, indeed, these 
are words in your mouth
Be glad its not my massive 7.5 inch
Super Johnson!

I took care of the parking issue, renewing my lease, paying my card. I registered my car,
Bought stamps.

I don't know what the future holds, but, I've founds stamps useful.
I want to buy some coins, and maybe some money.
What else?

I would like to take a nap.
and get some rest
and really put my head down.
yeah. that's really what I would
like to do.

The Chestnut + Hazel Logo is complete, not because I think that it has achieved perfection, but because I'm just not going to work on it anymore. I'm going to register a copyright for all of the attempts, and the one that I'm going to use as a logo is the one I'm going to register the trademark for.























So that's it, that's the Logo, that's the trademark. I'm done, and again, I don't think that it's prefect, but it's at a point in it's evolution, and I'm at a point in my energy levels where I think I'm going to leave it here.

...

Well, I guess I'll leave it there for now, one of the issues is that I completed the paperwork to register a copyright for The Complete Letters from Sanford Street, and it needs to be published somewhere, so I have to leave it there, in it's more or less existing condition before starting to edit it and all that. I'm not sure what's so sensitive about it, since is strictly text.

...

I don't know what to do about this.



















This is such a long post, and going over everything is going to take an eternity. This could take a long time to edit. This is a nightmare. This is all text and I could swear that there is nothing totally unusual here.

I'm continuing to work through The Complete Letters from Sanford Street, removing anything that I think violates the community standards. Even if I didn't have to deal with Blogger, I still have to deal with AdSense, so I might as well do all of this.


...

I'm getting ready to finish some work that I've been working on for the past few days. As far as going on another road trip goes, to Utah or Idaho, that's really something that's going to have to wait. I signed up for overtime next week, and, that's not really going to leave any free time for me, I signed up for two quarter shifts, and then half shifts were later offered, but I couldn't take them because I had already taken the quarter shifts.

...

Today is Friday, and I'm not really feeling in a particularly good mood. It comes and goes, but I'm not really sure how to shake it, how to get rid of this feeling of sadness. It's hard to function. Thank God I'd finished my homework. I'm compiling my Letters from Sanford Street Series. I can't really believe how long ago this all was. The whole Texas thing. weird times, something out of a nightmare. Letter's from Sanford Street # 490 is where the New Orleans Road Trip Disaster is documented.

...

Good god. What is this? I'm so sick of it. Out of nowhere the unhappiness. Out of the blue, the blues.

...

Class is over, and I'm really tired. I'm going to take a nap.

...

While taking, or attempting to take a selfie, I noticed that I'm really nice and fat, and that I could stand to lose some weight.

...

What do I have to work on? what things do I need to work on? Is there anything I need to do, and I'm just missing it?

...






























...



















































Thursday and Friday I'm off work. I kind of wish that I had moved a shift later on in the week because, like always, I could have used the money. but, I don't know what it is but I'm just not performing well at work. I'm tired all the time, and no matter what I do, it's the same issue, I've been consuming substantially more caffeine, but, to no avail, I'm just too tired and fatigued, and then I get these moment where I'm paralyzed with sadness. I shouldn't have skipped two days of work,

...

I'm back home. I'm in a better mood. I have to think. If I go anywhere again, I think I'll wait until Wednesday Morning of next week. That's August 2nd. I'm working on a favicon. It's related to my class coursework, but, I wasn't required to make a favicon, just provide an example of one. but I decided I would make a favicon for Chestnut + Hazel.

Unrelated, but I did see something funny, and thought it was something else:











it turns out it was just for campaign contributions for some such politician or another, but, yeah, I don't know. i kind of swore off online dating a few months back, and really, I don't really want to try that again.
