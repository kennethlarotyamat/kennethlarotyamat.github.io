I'm really tired. I napped for a few hours, but I didn't get any actual sleep.


I have some unrelated good news. I don't have to enroll in. I don't have to
worry about enrolling in classes at UNLV until late november,

this means i can just focus on the stuff i already had going on

the software development class ends mid november. so i'll have some time to 
loaf around or something. well, even if. the spring semester at UNLV wouldn't start until 
next year. i think. so i would still have december to loaf around. 

assuming i'm still unemployed.

I'm tired and I really don't know where to start

Project 12 beat me to death, and Project 13 is already due tomorrow.
nightmare. total. nightmare.
