Conclusion & Takeaways
Local hosting and cloud hosting each have their place in the field of website development. It’s all about deciding where you want to save your files, and striking a balance between the pros and cons in any given context. Consider the scenarios below and evaluate whether local hosting or cloud hosting is the most advisable option. After reading each scenario, circle the type of hosting you recommend.
Scenario 1
You’ve decided to build yourself a small website to serve as a portfolio of your work as a web developer. Eventually you will want to put it online, but for now you are still just playing around with the code, trying to get it to look polished and professional.
Question
Which type of hosting would you recommend? Select one of the following and justify your choice :

local hosting
cloud hosting
I would recommend local hosting because for a portfolio it only needs to be worked on, and doesn't need a host, and it's not ready for public viewing, and there is no need to pay fees when you don't need to.
Modify answer
Your answer has been submitted and will be reviewed by your teacher in due course.
Scenario 2
Your customer wants to put up a one-page website as soon as possible so that they can begin running Google Ads that drive traffic to their page. The page will include their logo, mission statement, contact information, and opening hours. They may add to the website later, but for now, they just want a live page to work with Google Ads.
Question
Which type of hosting would you recommend? Select one of the following and justify your choice :

local hosting
cloud hosting
I would recommend cloud hosting because Google needs to see the page, and there is a need for collaboration, and public viewing of the page, and there is a need to run Google Ads and drive traffic, it needs to be live.
Modify answer
Your answer has been submitted and will be reviewed by your teacher in due course.
Scenario 3

Question
Which type of hosting would you recommend? Select one of the following and justify your choice:

local hosting
cloud hosting
The public / published website should be using cloud hosting, but for the locally hosted page, it should use local hosting to continue development work. It's possible to have two environments in this case.
Modify answer
Your answer has been submitted and will be reviewed by your teacher in due course.
Scenario 4
Your friend has asked you to help them create a one-page HTML file with their resume’s information. Your friend has not bought a domain name yet, they only want help with building the HTML file.

1. Setting Up a Localhost
Setting Up a Localhost
Goals
By the end of this lesson you will:
Understand how to set up localhost
Set up localhost on your computer
Practice using your newly configured localhost
Introduction
Learning how to set up a localhost on your computer is a handy bit of knowledge that will allow you to play around with website development, without publishing unfinished work and without needing to pay for cloud hosting. The process is different depending on your operating system. We will consider how to set up a localhost server in Windows 10. If you are not running Windows 10 or if you encounter technical difficulties, an alternative activity will be provided.
Business Context
In a business context, your employer may already have a hosting set up as well as IT employees who assist with configurations and access. However, it is also possible that you will work for a small business, or that you will decide to work as a freelance web developer. In the later case, knowing how to use localhost will provide you with the independence you need to get started quickly.

Watch the following video to learn how to set up localhost in Windows 10. It is recommended that you watch the video all the way through one time and then re-watch the video, following along by doing each step on your own computer, pausing as needed. Basic steps are listed below the video link to help you in case your computer looks different than the one in the video.
If you run into trouble (with permissions for example), you can use the alternate activity on the next page.
Video: How to set up a local host in Windows 10
Open your Control Panel
Open Programs and Features
Click on Turn Window features on or off
turn features on or off
In the popup, locate Internet Information Services, check the box. If you also see Internet Information Services Hostable Web Core then check that box as well. Click OK.
edits to internet information services
Allow your computer to search for required files and apply changes. Do not cancel.
When your computer is finished making the changes, it may ask to restart your computer. This is normal. Save any changes you may need to in open files. Close everything including the Control Panel and restart your computer.
You are now ready to test your localhost. Open a new tab in your browser and type localhost and hit Enter.
You will see a window like this one:
example window
Using file explorer go to C:\inetpub\wwwroot and double click on iisstart.png
It will ask what program it should use to open .png files and suggest Photos. You can just click OK. It will open the png file in photos and will look like the localhost start page.
Save the image below as test.png in this folder: C:\inetpub\wwwroot
practice image to save
Now return to your browser tab to view http://localhost/test.png

3. Alternate activity
Alternate activity:
If you do not have Windows 10 or do not have the necessary permissions to set up localhost or if you did not have the necessary permissions to save an image in the wwwroot folder, you can try this activity instead.
Create a new folder on your computer called MyLocalWebsite.
Save the image below as test.png in this new folder.
image to save
Open TextPad or Notepad on your computer.
Copy the code below into TextPad or Notepad.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8" />
   <title>My local web page</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1 style="text-align:center;">Locally Hosted Web Page</h1>
   <img src="test.png" style="width:100%;" alt="This is a test image"/>
</body>
</html>
Save the file as test.html in your MyLocalWebsite folder.
Now use file explorer to locate this file on your computer.
Double click on the file test.html to open it.
The file will open in a tab on your browser. You can modify this local html file, save the changes, and refresh your browser tab to view the changes.
Since websites include many files, it’s good practice to organize your images in a separate image folder. Create a new folder called img inside the MyLocalWebsite folder.
Save the following images as test2.jpg and test3.jpg in this new img folder.
test image 2
test image 3
Update your code in your local test.html file to read these two images from the img folder instead of the original test.png image.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8" />
   <title>My local web page</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1 style="text-align:center;">Locally Hosted Web Page</h1>

5. Conclusion & Takeaways
Conclusion & Takeaways
Though it comes with some limitations, the flexibility of working locally in web development is sometimes very convenient, especially when you are just getting started with a project. Knowing that only you can see your files can remove pressure and free you to explore, take risks and get creative. Cloud hosting can always be set up later.

1. Setting Up a Cloudhost
Setting Up a Cloudhost
Goals
By the end of this case you will:
Know how to select a cloud hosting provider and a hosting package
Understand how to use FTP to move files
Familiarize yourself with cPanel
Introduction

If the decision has been made to host the website using Cloud Hosting, the next step is to determine which cloud hosting provider will be contracted to host the website. Hosting providers offer a variety of options with their hosting packages. A decision must be made regarding which cloud hosting package is best suited for your project. Once the cloud hosting environment has been set up, you can use FTP to upload local copies of your website files (stored on your computer) to the cloud. It is also possible that your hosting package includes cPanel access, in which case you can directly access and update your website files in the cloud without the need for local copies of the files.
Business Context
If your employer or client already has a public website, then they already have a Cloud Hosting environment. Sometimes a client does not know how to access their files but they do know who their Hosting provider is. In this case you can contact the hosting provider directly and they will provide you with either FTP or cPanel access. If your client does not have a website yet, you may need to recommend a hosting provider and package for the project as well as coordinate with the hosting provider on behalf of the client to set up the environment and gain access to it.

2. Selecting a Cloud Host & Package
Selecting a Cloud Host & Package
There are many web hosting providers to choose from. Some of the most popular include:
Bluehost https://www.bluehost.com/
HostGator https://www.hostgator.com/web-hosting/
HOSTINGER https://www.hostinger.com/
Each of these providers offers the choice of shared hosting, dedicated hosting, and VPS hosting (Virtual Private Server). We will briefly overview the differences between these.
Shared Hosting - Best for small websites with low traffic
This is the most common type of cloud hosting and is the first choice for small businesses. With shared web hosting, many websites share resources on a single server. You will only have access to your files, but you will share bandwidth, processing power and memory with the other websites on that server. While this is the least expensive hosting option, there can be disadvantages, particularly if your website is very large and/or supports a great deal of traffic. Another concern with shared hosting relates to security. If a website on the shared server becomes infected with malware, for example, it can infect other websites on that server.
Package prices vary depending, among other things, on the amount of space included in the package. Discounted prices are offered at signup, but renewed at a different price. Other signup perks are also offered. Email should be included with a hosting package but isn’t always.
No matter what package you select, it is always worthwhile to call the hosting provider to speak directly with a representative. They will be able to answer all of your questions about what is included for the first year only, and what is included when the package renews the following year.
One small note regarding SSL certificates: Though free SSL certificates are generally available for at least the first year of shared hosting, these are not the best SSL certificates. Most hosting providers and/or domain name registrars offer a variety of SSL certificates as a separate product depending on the level of data encryption your website requires. For simplicity, we will not worry about SSL certificates at this time.
Below, you will find information about three comparable hosting packages from different cloud hosting providers as of January 2023. Items in red, though included with the package, are free to everyone regardless of their web hosting provider. Items in blue are very nice to have, but you’ll want to ask the hosting provider if those benefits carry over to the following year, or if they only apply for the first year.
It is usually also possible to purchase add-ons if there is something you want that is not included in the package you are considering. Remember that hosting providers want your business and can sometimes be flexible when presented with a competing offer. Don’t be afraid to ask lots of questions, and a little negotiation can only work in your favor.

3. Dedicated Hosting vs VPS Hosting
Dedicated Hosting vs VPS Hosting
cover image
Image by Freepik
As we saw in the previous section, shared hosting is an affordable solution for a smaller website that sees limited traffic.
Larger websites, however, will require additional resources. Among other things, they need more storage and more bandwidth to operate. For these websites, dedicated hosting & VPS hosting offer two alternatives to shared hosting.
Dedicated Hosting - Ideal for larger companies with more traffic
This kind of hosting is more expensive (between   100−
 150 a month), but comes with many benefits. With dedicated hosting, your website is the only one on that server. With this kind of hosting, you are not sharing bandwidth or server resources or memory with other websites. This will help your website to run faster and handle more traffic than it could with shared hosting.
The risk of malware or virus infection from neighboring websites is also eliminated because your site is alone on the server (you have no neighbors). Since you’re paying more, you can count on improved, around-the-clock technical support from the hosting provider.
VPS Hosting - Ideal for the in-between
This kind of hosting is a middle-ground between shared and dedicated hosting. Your website is on a shared server BUT a specific quantity of resources, bandwidth and memory are dedicated to your website. It is perfect for a website that has outgrown shared hosting but is not quite big enough to require dedicated hosting.
As with shared hosting, there are different packages available depending on the volume of server resources/bandwidth/memory that will be dedicated exclusively to your website, but you can expect to pay somewhere around $50 per month.

A website expects more than 100 000 visitors per month and expects it will process an average of 20 000 transactions per month. What kind of hosting solution is right for this website?

4. FTP : File Transfer Protocol
FTP : File Transfer Protocol
FTP is a means of moving files between your computer and the cloud hosting environment. You can upload files to the host server or download files from that host server. There are several programs that help you do this, but FileZilla ( https://filezilla-project.org/ ) is FREE and widely used because it is available for Mac, Windows and Linux systems. There is also an affordable PRO version of the software that offers additional features, though generally the free software is sufficient.
The software must be downloaded to your computer and access to a website can be added using the login credentials provided to you by your web hosting provider.
One of the major advantages of using FTP is that you can upload and download not only files, but entire folders, including sub-folders with a simple drag and drop. Though it may take some time, the folder and sub-folder structure will be respected, which is great for moving a website from localhost to cloudhost, or for backing-up folders locally before making changes on the server files.
You can view some screenshots of the software here: https://filezilla-project.org/client_screenshots.php
Here is a short introductory video to FileZilla
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilbuyOGA00
Getting to know cPanel
cPanel access is sometimes included with your cloud hosting package. There are hosting providers who will only make cPanel available at an additional charge.
cPanel is an easy-to-use website management platform offering a wide variety of features including a file manager, database access, virus scanner, PHP version manager and more. It is accessed through your web browser using login credentials provided to you by your web hosting provider. Always request cPanel access to your hosting environment as cPanel tools are tremendously helpful for web development.

5. Conclusion & Takeaways
Conclusion & Takeaways
Selecting the best cloud hosting solution for your web project can seem a little daunting at first glance. There are so many features, packages and providers to choose from. Prices are often listed as discount prices for first-time clients and it is not always apparent what the renewal prices will be. Those low first-time prices also often depend on contracts that are billed annually even though prices are advertised as monthly.
To make the best choice, you need to think about what your project requires. If it is a small website, then a shared hosting solution is desirable. If it is a large website that expects a good deal of traffic, then dedicated hosting is more appropriate. If the website is medium sized, meaning it requires dedicated resources but is not large enough to justify the expense of dedicated hosting, then VPS hosting offers a reasonable middle-ground between shared and dedicated hosting.
Once you have a cloud hosted environment for your website, you will need to access it. FTP software like FileZilla and cPanel access will provide you with the means of managing your website.
