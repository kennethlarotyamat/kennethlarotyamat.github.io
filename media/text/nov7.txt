Conclusion & Takeaways
Local hosting and cloud hosting each have their place in the field of website development. It’s all about deciding where you want to save your files, and striking a balance between the pros and cons in any given context. Consider the scenarios below and evaluate whether local hosting or cloud hosting is the most advisable option. After reading each scenario, circle the type of hosting you recommend.
Scenario 1
You’ve decided to build yourself a small website to serve as a portfolio of your work as a web developer. Eventually you will want to put it online, but for now you are still just playing around with the code, trying to get it to look polished and professional.
Question
Which type of hosting would you recommend? Select one of the following and justify your choice :

local hosting
cloud hosting
I would recommend local hosting because for a portfolio it only needs to be worked on, and doesn't need a host, and it's not ready for public viewing, and there is no need to pay fees when you don't need to.

Question
Which type of hosting would you recommend? Select one of the following and justify your choice :

local hosting
cloud hosting
I would recommend cloud hosting because Google needs to see the page, and there is a need for collaboration, and public viewing of the page, and there is a need to run Google Ads and drive traffic, it needs to be live.

Question
Which type of hosting would you recommend? Select one of the following and justify your choice:

The public / published website should be using cloud hosting, but for the locally hosted page, it should use local hosting to continue development work. It's possible to have two environments in this case.

1. Setting Up a Localhost
Setting Up a Localhost
Goals
By the end of this lesson you will:
Understand how to set up localhost
Set up localhost on your computer
Practice using your newly configured localhost
Introduction
Learning how to set up a localhost on your computer is a handy bit of knowledge that will allow you to play around with website development, without publishing unfinished work and without needing to pay for cloud hosting. The process is different depending on your operating system. We will consider how to set up a localhost server in Windows 10. If you are not running Windows 10 or if you encounter technical difficulties, an alternative activity will be provided.
Business Context
In a business context, your employer may already have a hosting set up as well as IT employees who assist with configurations and access. However, it is also possible that you will work for a small business, or that you will decide to work as a freelance web developer. In the later case, knowing how to use localhost will provide you with the independence you need to get started quickly.

Watch the following video to learn how to set up localhost in Windows 10. It is recommended that you watch the video all the way through one time and then re-watch the video, following along by doing each step on your own computer, pausing as needed. Basic steps are listed below the video link to help you in case your computer looks different than the one in the video.
If you run into trouble (with permissions for example), you can use the alternate activity on the next page.
Video: How to set up a local host in Windows 10
Open your Control Panel
Open Programs and Features
Click on Turn Window features on or off
turn features on or off
In the popup, locate Internet Information Services, check the box. If you also see Internet Information Services Hostable Web Core then check that box as well. Click OK.
edits to internet information services
Allow your computer to search for required files and apply changes. Do not cancel.
When your computer is finished making the changes, it may ask to restart your computer. This is normal. Save any changes you may need to in open files. Close everything including the Control Panel and restart your computer.
You are now ready to test your localhost. Open a new tab in your browser and type localhost and hit Enter.
You will see a window like this one:
example window
Using file explorer go to C:\inetpub\wwwroot and double click on iisstart.png
It will ask what program it should use to open .png files and suggest Photos. You can just click OK. It will open the png file in photos and will look like the localhost start page.
Save the image below as test.png in this folder: C:\inetpub\wwwroot
practice image to save
Now return to your browser tab to view http://localhost/test.png

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8" />
   <title>My local web page</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1 style="text-align:center;">Locally Hosted Web Page</h1>
   <img src="test.png" style="width:100%;" alt="This is a test image"/>
</body>
</html>

3. Alternate activity
Alternate activity:
If you do not have Windows 10 or do not have the necessary permissions to set up localhost or if you did not have the necessary permissions to save an image in the wwwroot folder, you can try this activity instead.
Create a new folder on your computer called MyLocalWebsite.
Save the image below as test.png in this new folder.
image to save
Open TextPad or Notepad on your computer.
Copy the code below into TextPad or Notepad.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8" />
   <title>My local web page</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1 style="text-align:center;">Locally Hosted Web Page</h1>
   <img src="test.png" style="width:100%;" alt="This is a test image"/>
</body>
</html>
Save the file as test.html in your MyLocalWebsite folder.
Now use file explorer to locate this file on your computer.
Double click on the file test.html to open it.
The file will open in a tab on your browser. You can modify this local html file, save the changes, and refresh your browser tab to view the changes.
Since websites include many files, it’s good practice to organize your images in a separate image folder. Create a new folder called img inside the MyLocalWebsite folder.
Save the following images as test2.jpg and test3.jpg in this new img folder.
test image 2
test image 3
Update your code in your local test.html file to read these two images from the img folder instead of the original test.png image.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8" />
   <title>My local web page</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1 style="text-align:center;">Locally Hosted Web Page</h1>
   <img src="img/test2.jpg" style="width:45%;float:left;" alt="This is a test image"/>
   <img src="img/test3.jpg" style="width:45%;float:right;" alt="This is a test image"/>

</body>
