2. Overview of Agile
What is Agile?
Agile illustration
Agile is a paradigm in project management based on the Agile Manifesto, written in 2001 by a group of seventeen software professionals who met to discuss the philosophy behind lightweight software development. The Manifesto outlines 4 key values and 12 principles. These values and principles form the basis of Agile and guide the practices and techniques in Agile methodologies. We’ll explore the key values and principles more shortly.
Agile, in a nutshell, is a response to the limitations of the traditional Waterfall model for project management and represents a monumental shift in the approach to software development. The Waterfall model was linear and required detailed planning and documentation, which often led to longer development cycles and difficulty in accommodating changes. Agile, with its iterative and incremental approach, presents a great solution to these issues.
While the principles and values of Agile are constant, within the Agile paradigm there are several methodologies or frameworks that teams can use to implement Agile. In this lesson we will focus on Scrum, which is one of the most popular implementations of Agile in software development.
Agile Values and Principles
As mentioned earlier, the Agile Manifesto (the seminal work that established Agile as a philosophy and methodology for product development), sets out 4 key values and 12 guiding principles. Let’s now explore each of these values and principles to better understand what Agile is.
4 Key Values:
Agile core values
Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools: Agile places a higher value on individuals and their interactions. While processes and tools are important, they should serve the people doing the work, not the other way around.
Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation: In traditional methodologies, large amounts of time are spent creating detailed documentation. Agile, however, places emphasis on delivering working software. That’s not to say documentation isn’t important in Agile; it’s about creating documentation that truly delivers value.
Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation: Rather than negotiating terms and sticking strictly to them, Agile encourages continuous customer or stakeholder involvement. The idea is to work with the customer throughout the development process to understand their needs and adapt the product accordingly.
Responding to Change over Following a Plan: In Agile, change is not only expected but also welcomed, even late in development. Agile teams are ready to respond to change in order to provide the customer with the best possible product. While having a plan is important, the ability to adapt to changes is viewed as more crucial.
12 Guiding Principles:
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

focusing on individuals is the emphasis, rather than the specific processes.
working software over documentation. comment code and all that, it's not that 
documentation is bad, first priority is sofware that works, before we have the 
documentation. happy customers are the priority.

4. Overview of Scrum
What is Scrum?
Scrum illustration
Scrum, named after a formation in rugby where team members act together to get the ball, is a lightweight yet powerful framework for complex product development. It doesn’t provide detailed instructions for every scenario but offers a set of rules, roles, events, and artifacts for managing work. Scrum embraces the Agile principles of flexibility, speed, customer collaboration, and continuous improvement.
Scrum Principles
Scrum operates on six key principles:
Empirical Process Control: Scrum relies on evidence-based decision-making where progress is based on observed results rather than predictions.
Self-organization: Teams are given the autonomy to manage and organize their work, leveraging the expertise of its members.
Collaboration: All stakeholders, including team members and customers, work closely together throughout the development process.
Value-based prioritization: Features and tasks are prioritized based on their value to the customer or project outcome.
Time-boxing: Work is structured into fixed-length intervals (sprints) with specific goals, ensuring timely delivery and feedback.
Iterative development: The product is developed and improved in small increments, allowing for regular feedback and adjustments.
Scrum framework
Components of Scrum
Scrum Artifacts
Scrum Artifacts are tools that provide information and give insights into the product and the project. These include the Product Backlog, a prioritized list of desired product features or changes; the Sprint Backlog, a subset of the Product Backlog that the team commits to deliver during a Sprint; and the Increment, the sum of all Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. These artifacts help teams plan and track their work, assess their progress, and adapt their plans as needed.
Scrum Roles
There are three main roles in Scrum: the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the Development Team.
The Product Owner is the key stakeholder who has a vision of what they wish to build and conveys that vision to the team. The Scrum Master facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and helps the team perform at their highest level. The Development Team is the group of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable product Increment at the end of each Sprint.
Scrum Events
Scrum Ceremonies, also known as events, provide the framework for the team to get work done in a structured manner, facilitate communication, and reduce unnecessary meetings.
These include Sprint Planning (where the team determines the product backlog items they will work on during the sprint and discusses the plan for delivering the product increment), Daily Scrum (a quick meeting for the team to sync up and plan their day’s work), Sprint Review (where the team, stakeholders, and Product Owner review what was accomplished during the sprint and update the backlog), and Sprint Retrospective (where the team reflects on their performance during the sprint and discusses ways to improve for the next sprint).
User Stories
User story illustration
User Stories are a powerful tool in Agile and Scrum, serving as a simple description of a product feature from the end-user’s perspective.
Effective User Stories should conform to the INVEST criteria: Independent (can be developed in any sequence), Negotiable (details can be worked out over time), Valuable (provides value to the customer), Estimable (enough information is provided to estimate size), Small (can be completed within one sprint), and Testable (clear acceptance criteria are defined).
A User Story might be something like: “As a user, I want a search function on the homepage so that I can easily find information on the website.” The corresponding acceptance criteria might include: “Given I am on the homepage, when I enter ‘FAQ’ into the search bar and hit enter, then the FAQ page should appear in the search results.”

One suggestion would be to try and refactor your personal website in React. Alternatively, you could try searching Google for some React project ideas and attempt to build one of them. Or, maybe you’ve got your own idea for a React project already and could try building that.

6. Common Software Tools
Tools can play a significant role in implementing Agile and Scrum effectively. Jira, Trello, and Asana are some popular ones. Jira, developed by Atlassian, is an issue tracking product that allows bugs tracking and agile project management. It can manage the entire life cycle of a task, from requirement to deployment. Trello, with its Kanban-style boards, lists, and cards, is great for managing and visualizing project tasks. Asana allows for task assignments, commenting, and tracking, making it a useful tool for managing work, especially in a remote setting. These tools can help teams collaborate, track progress, manage changes, and stay aligned with their goals.
