Introduction
Now that we have a solid understanding of some common website attacks, we must learn how to defend against them. Cybersecurity is a field unto itself, but as a website developer there are many things you can do to protect your employer/client and their data, as well as to protect users who visit your website. In this section, we will consider simple defenses against XSS attacks by learning how to filter user inputs on simple contact forms.

Business Context
While larger companies do employ cybersecurity experts to safeguard their websites, their servers, and their networks, smaller companies will depend on their web developers to make their websites as safe as possible. Web hosting providers also have a critically important role to play in securing the websites they host by securing their servers. As a website developer, you are not responsible for server level security. You are however responsible for ensuring that the website you build, and the code it uses, respect web security best practices.

2. Filtering User Inputs
Filtering User Inputs
You will recall that Cross Site Scripting attacks occur when malicious code is injected through a form on the website. The attacker needs to inject and execute their malicious code. You can prevent this by validating inputs and sanitizing variables. This is known as input encoding. The attacker will still be able to enter their malicious code, but your code will intercept it and clean it up before it can run, thereby thwarting the attack.
Consider the following HTML form.
newsletter signups
This form will take input from the user (name and email address) in order to add the user to the list of Newsletter recipients. If an attacker tries to enter malicious code in the name or email fields, we will need to intercept the attack.
When the user clicks the submit button, a JavaScript function is called that will validate and sanitize the user inputs so that they can be safely submitted. If the user inputs are unsafe, the form will not submit and instead show an error message.
The HTML code for this form, as well as the JavaScript function are included below.
Save the code below as a file in your localhost environment, then view the file in your browser.
<!DOCTYPE html>

putting javascript in the. in a different page helps with security somewhat. it just makes it slightly more difficult for 
people to mess with your website.

What is the glaring validation issue with this form?
There are two fields here. The name is not being validated, we also need to validate the name field as well.
need to run a filter test on the name, and also apply it to the name area.

3. Conclusion & Takeaways
Conclusion & Takeaways
Controlling user inputs on forms is an essential element of defense against XSS attacks. This can be done by limiting the length of inputs, matching inputs against expected patterns, and of course most importantly sanitizing variables before submitting them.
Never output unsanitized user inputs.

Goals
By the end of this case you will:
Understand the importance of specifying your base directory
Know the difference between full paths and relative paths
Understand how to use relative paths to include files in your code
Practice sanitizing a variable containing a file path
Introduction
Since directory traversal involves an attacker attempting to gain access to content outside of the website’s root directory, the first line of defense occurs at the server level. Your web host will set permissions on the directories in your hosting environment which should prevent an attacker from gaining access to higher level directories.
That being said, you can still make your code more robust against directory traversal attacks.

A modem connects your home network to your internet service provider (ISP). A router connects your devices to your home network or WiFi network so they can communicate with each other. 

Lifewire
Here are some other differences between modems and routers: 
Modem
A box that connects your home network to your ISP. Modems translate different digital languages from the components that make up your home network.
Router
A box that lets all of your wired and wireless devices use your internet connection at once. Routers create the network inside your house.
While they can operate independently, most people use them together.

Yes, modems are still used today. They act as gateways to the internet, converting signals from your internet service provider (ISP) into a format that your devices can understand. Modems are essential for modern communication because they allow us to connect computers to each other over long distances. 
Modems are used for: 
Streaming videos
Downloading files
High-speed computer network links to outlying areas
Connecting computers to each other over long distances using existing infrastructure such as telephone lines, cable TV networks, or satellite networks
There are different types of modems, including: Radio modems, Cable modems. 
You can purchase compatible modems separately from any retailer to cut down on the monthly cost. Broadband providers also “rent” modems as part of their subscription plans. 
You can test your internet speed with online tools like Speedtest.net. If you feel that your internet speeds have decreased or you are seeing issues with increased buffering and lagging or breaking in the connection, it could be time for a new modem.

2. Don’t Open the Door
Don’t Open the Door
The most effective way to prevent directory traversal is to avoid passing any user supplied input to the file system in the first place. If the door is never open, an attacker will never be able to get through it. The risk arrives when a user has the opportunity to speak to the file system through a form or through a querystring as seen in unit 2.1.
BASE_DIRECTORY
Even if the door is closed, it is considered good practice to establish the base directory in your code. Website development platforms like WordPress will do this by default, but if you are not using a content management system, you can explicitly set the base directory as a variable to be used throughout your code.
The second most important thing you can do is to sanitize user input variables, as you did in the previous unit, to ensure that they do not contain directory traversing inputs. User inputs must always be sanitized.
Below is a screenshot that showcases an example of how to specify your base directory. It is assumed that the userInput has been sanitized.
Before processing the file, this code double checks that the file path begins with the base directory. This is another effective mitigation tactic against directory traversal.
code to double check
Taken from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg5lb_dmwuM
If the file path does not begin with the base_directory, the file absolutely must not be processed.
Using Relative Paths
Please take a moment to view this short video to refresh your memory about the difference between full (absolute) paths and relative paths: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ0xvY5wT5Q
Understanding how to use …/ as a means of navigating a file system will help you better understand directory traversal attacks and how to prevent them. Suppose your website URL is https://mysite.com.
You are working in a file whose full path is https://mysite.com/shop/category1/singleproduct.php
And you would like to include a file whose full path is https://mysite.com/js/functions.js
When you include this file, you could of course include it with the full path, but using a relative path is best. Every …/ moves you up a directory from where you currently are.
Suppose you are standing at singleproduct.php.
file path
The first …/ will take you into the category1 directory.
The next …/ will take you into the shop directory.
The next …/ will take you into the base directory for https://mysite.com .
directory traversal
Then you must go forward into the js directory before naming the file you want to include.
In this case, the relative path to include would be ‥/‥/‥/js/functions.js

And you would like to include a file whose full path is https://mysite.com/js/functions.js
When you include this file, you could of course include it with the full path, but using a relative path is best. Every …/ moves you up a directory from where you currently are.
Suppose you are standing at singleproduct.php.
file path
The first …/ will take you into the category1 directory.
The next …/ will take you into the shop directory.
The next …/ will take you into the base directory for https://mysite.com .
directory traversal
Then you must go forward into the js directory before naming the file you want to include.
In this case, the relative path to include would be ‥/‥/‥/js/functions.js

...

Exercise
You are working in a file with full path: base_directory/my_account/orders.php

You would like to include the file base_directory/inc/functions.php in your orders.php file. What path will you use to include the file?

../inc/functions.php
Submit Answer!

in this case, we are already in the account, the root or base directory, so we just need the two dots for 
this to work.

3. Conclusion & Takeaways
Conclusion & Takeaways
Good code is safe code. By taking basic precautions against common attacks, you can protect your website and its users from malicious actors. Forms can be weak points in terms of security because they allow users to enter and submit inputs. By restricting, validating and sanitizing user inputs your code can be made more robust. ALL user inputs should ALWAYS be sanitized before they are submitted.
Remember that cybersecurity is fluid. Attacks evolve as vulnerabilities emerge and web developers must implement new security practices and patches as they become available. A responsible web developer is proactive in learning about emerging threats so that their code can be maintained and made robust in the face of new attacks.

Introduction
WordPress, as you know, is a website content management system that offers many advantages. It’s also important to be mindful of the security risks that can emerge at various stages of development and how to mitigate them. The OWASP Top Ten Web Application Security Risks includes Vulnerable and Outdated Components which is of particular relevance to WordPress websites.
cover image security lock
Image by kjpargeter on Freepik
Business Context
Approximately 63% of websites are built in WordPress making it very likely that you will work in WordPress as a developer. If you are building the website from the ground up, you will be able to include basic security measures at the outset. If, however, the website is already in place, it will be important to assess the security measures in place and to scan for vulnerabilities in order to take the steps necessary to secure the website’s existing vulnerabilities.
WordPress Vulnerabilities
WordPress websites are built using themes and plugins that can present malicious actors with vulnerable points of entry. When new versions that include security patches are released you must update WordPress/theme/plugin versions to ensure that your website is not exposed to attacks that could have been prevented.
Installing too many plugins on a website exposes that website to an increased number of security risks. It is recommended that you limit the number of plugins your website requires and that you delete plugins and themes that you are not using. With fewer plugins, your website will be more secure, will load more quickly and will require less maintenance.
Take a quick look at this list of plugin vulnerabilities to understand the scope of the problem. https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins
Defending WordPress Websites
Let’s make your personal WordPress website more secure by installing the Wordfence Security plugin.
Step 1: If you can remember from Module 8, we installed LocalWP to set up a local WordPress environment on our computers. Open the application LocalWP and go to your Admin settings.
Tip: It is crucial to ensure that we exclusively use LocalWP for installing plugins, whether they are free or paid, rather than installing them directly on wordpress.com.
Step 2: Using the left-hand menu, navigate to Plugins → Add New
Step 3: Use the search bar in the upper left-hand corner to search for Wordfence
Step 4: Click Install Now button on the Wordfence Security plugin
install wordfence button
Step 5: Once it is installed, click the Activate button.
Step 6: Using the left-hand menu, navigate to Wordfence Dashboard

Step 7: Navigate to All Options in the Wordfence sub-menu
Step 8: This is where we will configure your Wordfence plugin. There are premium options that can be accessed for a subscription fee, but these will not be discussed at this time.
wordfence setup
If you haven’t already, be sure to enter your email address to receive security alerts.
Always select the Recommended settings if you are unsure.
Hide the WordPress version from attackers. It’s none of their business
It is wise to disable code execution in the uploads directory.
Scroll down to Email Alert Preferences and decide if there are alerts you would prefer not to receive.
Below that you can also select how frequently you would like to receive Activity Reports.
Scroll down to Basic Firewall Options. A firewall acts as a protective barrier against attackers. The firewall status may be set to learning mode and this is ok to start, but eventually it should be set to Enabled and Protecting.
If you can, click Optimize the Wordfence Firewall.
click optimize
Click on Advanced Firewall Options and then scroll down to Rules. These Wordfence rules guard against some common attacks. You may notice that some of the attack categories are familiar to you ex. XSS and Traversal. All of these rules should be activated, though you do have the option to turn them off individually. If you are worried that your rules may be out of date, you also have the option to Manually refresh rules.
refresh rules
Scroll down to Brute Force Protection.
brute force protection
This option should be on. Below that you can decide how strict your login rules are. Different websites will require different settings here. If many users need to login all of the time, you may not want to be too strict and lock valid users out. Security is important, but so is the user experience. For example, if you check the option Immediately lock out invalid usernames, valid users who forgot their account details may get blocked from the public website (not good).
You should absolutely check the option: Prevent the use of passwords leaked in data breaches.
Scroll down to Additional Options
You should Enforce strong passwords for all members. It is safe to select all or most of these additional options.

3. Scanning WordPress for Vulnerabilities
Scanning WordPress for Vulnerabilities
Now that we have configured Wordfence, we can also use it to scan our website files/themes/plugins for known vulnerabilities.
Using the left-hand menu, navigate to Scan in the Wordfence sub-menu.
From this page you can click the Start New Scan button to begin scanning your website.
start scan button
This may take some time and it’s important to give the scan time to run to completion. It is worth noting that websites do slow down while they are being scanned. Since we do not want to have a negative impact on user experience, security scans are best performed during low traffic periods.
Once the scan is complete, you can scroll down to see Results Found.
Activity
What are the results of your Wordfence Security Scan? Share a screen capture or list of results.

Submit Answer!

It is essential that regular security scans are performed on any website. New vulnerabilities will arise over time. Regular security scans allow you to identify and patch the vulnerabilities so that your website is not exposed to attack.
Note that you should always have a backup of your website ready to restore before attempting to update plugins or themes. Occasionally, updates will break the front end of the website and if this cannot be remedied promptly, you may need to restore your backup.

4. Git Reviews
Git Reviews
Git is a free version control system that is the most widely used version control system in the world and is considered the industry standard for developers. Version control refers to tracking and managing code changes. Version control allows teams to review code before it is live, and to restore previous versions if something goes wrong with the live version. In the context of performing WordPress version and plugin security updates, Git’s version control allows you to undo and analyze any updates that would cause a display or compatibility problem.
Major Benefits of using Git
Access to a complete change history of every file.
Branching (new code) and merging (combine branches) capability.
Ability to trace back changes, review and analyze them
Getting started with Git
To get started, follow the instructions on this page to install Git for Windows. https://git-scm.com/download/win
download git
It is recommended that you accept the default (recommended) settings as you click “Next” through the installation. As we saw in the video, once you have installed Git, you can write your first commands to configure your username and email address.
command line git setup
Now you are ready to create your first Git repository. Watch this video to see how Git is set up. The start of the video shows the steps you just completed. The second half of the video will help you create your first repository, your first file and to do your first commit. Follow along in your Git terminal to get hands on Git experience. https://git-scm.com/video/get-going
Getting to know Git
As so many developer job openings list knowledge of Git as a required or preferred skill, taking the time to learn Git will strengthen your application.
Further reading to learn Git (documentation / instruction book / videos): https://git-scm.com/doc
Once you have worked through the instruction book and are more familiar with Git commands, you may want to download this Git “cheat sheet” so that you don’t have to look up every command as you go: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet
Best Practices for using Git
Commit often. Every time you “commit”, you are capturing a snapshot of the code base. This will be a version that you could return to if needed. It is better to commit too often rather than not often enough. A group of commits can always be combined to simplify the development history later on.
When you commit you can and should leave a detailed log message explaining why you are making this commit and what is contained within it.
Make sure to git pull (fetch) the global copy so you are working with the most recent version of the code.
Use the staging area to collect/review a group of edits before writing them to a commit.

Why do people use Git?


To allow version control


To facilitate collaboration of development teams


To track changes made to code

5. Conclusion & Takeaways
Conclusion & Takeaways
With continuously evolving cyber security threats, it is essential to monitor websites for vulnerabilities and resolve them as they occur. Prioritize WordPress version updates and Plugin version updates as outdated versions pose security risks. The Wordfence security plugin, and other plugins like it, can be configured to improve your website security and to identify vulnerabilities. Limiting the number of plugins that your site requires and ensuring that only secure versions of these plugins are used, will go a long way toward improving your site’s performance and security.
Cybersecurity is a rapidly growing field. Security scanning is often a web developer’s responsibility, so knowing how to do this is important. Learning about cPanel, file and folder permissions, or other security tools can make you more marketable. Sign up for security newsletters (wordfence has one) to learn how security breaches are investigated and uncovered. One employer has stated “If I’m hiring a web designer and they have an interest in security, that appeals to me.”
Beware! Updates can (occasionally) break the front end of your website so proceed with caution. It is good practice to make updates in the development environment rather than in production when possible. It is also wise to have a website backup on hand so that a broken site can be restored promptly when there is a problem following a plugin update.

The Wordfence security plugin, and other plugins like it, can be configured to improve your website security and to identify vulnerabilities. Limiting the number of plugins that your site requires and ensuring that only secure versions of these plugins are used, will go a long way toward improving your site’s performance and security.
Cybersecurity is a rapidly growing field. Security scanning is often a web developer’s responsibility, so knowing how to do this is important. Learning about cPanel, file and folder permissions, or other security tools can make you more marketable. Sign up for security newsletters (wordfence has one) to learn how security breaches are investigated and uncovered. One employer has stated “If I’m hiring a web designer and they have an interest in security, that appeals to me.”
Beware! Updates can (occasionally) break the front end of your website so proceed with caution. It is good practice to make updates in the development environment rather than in production when possible. It is also wise to have a website backup on hand so that a broken site can be restored promptly when there is a problem following a plugin update.
