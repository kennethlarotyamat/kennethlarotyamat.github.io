Introduction
Now that we have a solid understanding of some common website attacks, we must learn how to defend against them. Cybersecurity is a field unto itself, but as a website developer there are many things you can do to protect your employer/client and their data, as well as to protect users who visit your website. In this section, we will consider simple defenses against XSS attacks by learning how to filter user inputs on simple contact forms.

Business Context
While larger companies do employ cybersecurity experts to safeguard their websites, their servers, and their networks, smaller companies will depend on their web developers to make their websites as safe as possible. Web hosting providers also have a critically important role to play in securing the websites they host by securing their servers. As a website developer, you are not responsible for server level security. You are however responsible for ensuring that the website you build, and the code it uses, respect web security best practices.

2. Filtering User Inputs
Filtering User Inputs
You will recall that Cross Site Scripting attacks occur when malicious code is injected through a form on the website. The attacker needs to inject and execute their malicious code. You can prevent this by validating inputs and sanitizing variables. This is known as input encoding. The attacker will still be able to enter their malicious code, but your code will intercept it and clean it up before it can run, thereby thwarting the attack.
Consider the following HTML form.
newsletter signups
This form will take input from the user (name and email address) in order to add the user to the list of Newsletter recipients. If an attacker tries to enter malicious code in the name or email fields, we will need to intercept the attack.
When the user clicks the submit button, a JavaScript function is called that will validate and sanitize the user inputs so that they can be safely submitted. If the user inputs are unsafe, the form will not submit and instead show an error message.
The HTML code for this form, as well as the JavaScript function are included below.
Save the code below as a file in your localhost environment, then view the file in your browser.
<!DOCTYPE html>

putting javascript in the. in a different page helps with security somewhat. it just makes it slightly more difficult for 
people to mess with your website.

What is the glaring validation issue with this form?
There are two fields here. The name is not being validated, we also need to validate the name field as well.
need to run a filter test on the name, and also apply it to the name area.

3. Conclusion & Takeaways
Conclusion & Takeaways
Controlling user inputs on forms is an essential element of defense against XSS attacks. This can be done by limiting the length of inputs, matching inputs against expected patterns, and of course most importantly sanitizing variables before submitting them.
Never output unsanitized user inputs.

Goals
By the end of this case you will:
Understand the importance of specifying your base directory
Know the difference between full paths and relative paths
Understand how to use relative paths to include files in your code
Practice sanitizing a variable containing a file path
Introduction
Since directory traversal involves an attacker attempting to gain access to content outside of the website’s root directory, the first line of defense occurs at the server level. Your web host will set permissions on the directories in your hosting environment which should prevent an attacker from gaining access to higher level directories.
That being said, you can still make your code more robust against directory traversal attacks.

A modem connects your home network to your internet service provider (ISP). A router connects your devices to your home network or WiFi network so they can communicate with each other. 

Lifewire
Here are some other differences between modems and routers: 
Modem
A box that connects your home network to your ISP. Modems translate different digital languages from the components that make up your home network.
Router
A box that lets all of your wired and wireless devices use your internet connection at once. Routers create the network inside your house.
While they can operate independently, most people use them together.

Yes, modems are still used today. They act as gateways to the internet, converting signals from your internet service provider (ISP) into a format that your devices can understand. Modems are essential for modern communication because they allow us to connect computers to each other over long distances. 
Modems are used for: 
Streaming videos
Downloading files
High-speed computer network links to outlying areas
Connecting computers to each other over long distances using existing infrastructure such as telephone lines, cable TV networks, or satellite networks
There are different types of modems, including: Radio modems, Cable modems. 
You can purchase compatible modems separately from any retailer to cut down on the monthly cost. Broadband providers also “rent” modems as part of their subscription plans. 
You can test your internet speed with online tools like Speedtest.net. If you feel that your internet speeds have decreased or you are seeing issues with increased buffering and lagging or breaking in the connection, it could be time for a new modem.

2. Don’t Open the Door
Don’t Open the Door
The most effective way to prevent directory traversal is to avoid passing any user supplied input to the file system in the first place. If the door is never open, an attacker will never be able to get through it. The risk arrives when a user has the opportunity to speak to the file system through a form or through a querystring as seen in unit 2.1.
BASE_DIRECTORY
Even if the door is closed, it is considered good practice to establish the base directory in your code. Website development platforms like WordPress will do this by default, but if you are not using a content management system, you can explicitly set the base directory as a variable to be used throughout your code.
The second most important thing you can do is to sanitize user input variables, as you did in the previous unit, to ensure that they do not contain directory traversing inputs. User inputs must always be sanitized.
Below is a screenshot that showcases an example of how to specify your base directory. It is assumed that the userInput has been sanitized.
Before processing the file, this code double checks that the file path begins with the base directory. This is another effective mitigation tactic against directory traversal.
code to double check
Taken from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg5lb_dmwuM
If the file path does not begin with the base_directory, the file absolutely must not be processed.
Using Relative Paths
Please take a moment to view this short video to refresh your memory about the difference between full (absolute) paths and relative paths: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ0xvY5wT5Q
Understanding how to use …/ as a means of navigating a file system will help you better understand directory traversal attacks and how to prevent them. Suppose your website URL is https://mysite.com.
You are working in a file whose full path is https://mysite.com/shop/category1/singleproduct.php
And you would like to include a file whose full path is https://mysite.com/js/functions.js
When you include this file, you could of course include it with the full path, but using a relative path is best. Every …/ moves you up a directory from where you currently are.
Suppose you are standing at singleproduct.php.
file path
The first …/ will take you into the category1 directory.
The next …/ will take you into the shop directory.
The next …/ will take you into the base directory for https://mysite.com .
directory traversal
Then you must go forward into the js directory before naming the file you want to include.
In this case, the relative path to include would be ‥/‥/‥/js/functions.js

And you would like to include a file whose full path is https://mysite.com/js/functions.js
When you include this file, you could of course include it with the full path, but using a relative path is best. Every …/ moves you up a directory from where you currently are.
Suppose you are standing at singleproduct.php.
file path
The first …/ will take you into the category1 directory.
The next …/ will take you into the shop directory.
The next …/ will take you into the base directory for https://mysite.com .
directory traversal
Then you must go forward into the js directory before naming the file you want to include.
In this case, the relative path to include would be ‥/‥/‥/js/functions.js

...

Exercise
You are working in a file with full path: base_directory/my_account/orders.php

You would like to include the file base_directory/inc/functions.php in your orders.php file. What path will you use to include the file?

../inc/functions.php
Submit Answer!

in this case, we are already in the account, the root or base directory, so we just need the two dots for 
this to work.

want to sanitize the user input to sanitize the string. closed

3. Conclusion & Takeaways
Conclusion & Takeaways
Good code is safe code. By taking basic precautions against common attacks, you can protect your website and its users from malicious actors. Forms can be weak points in terms of security because they allow users to enter and submit inputs. By restricting, validating and sanitizing user inputs your code can be made more robust. ALL user inputs should ALWAYS be sanitized before they are submitted.
Remember that cybersecurity is fluid. Attacks evolve as vulnerabilities emerge and web developers must implement new security practices and patches as they become available. A responsible web developer is proactive in learning about emerging threats so that their code can be maintained and made robust in the face of new attacks.
