The Epic Adventures of Chestnut + Hazel

I don't know where else to write this. 
I could write it on my GitHub page, but 
I kind of screwed up that page while reorganizing 
things, so I'll just write it here.

I'm applying for a number of programs as UNLV: the MFA 
Creative Writing Program, the MS Quantitative Finance 
Program, and the MS Computer Science program.

I didn't realize this until just now: each program has a 
different due date, the MFA application is due first, 
or earliest or whatever, in January.

They are all of the Fall semester of 2024. I have to get the 
MFA application ready before January. I wrote 
one poem recently, and I really can't 
remember the last time I wrote one:

"The Young Woman who is the Post Office" (2022)

The rural carrier associate is a 
young woman with a lisp that lingers
long enough to wreck your week, and
fiery jade eyes that burn in your
mind every subsequent week.

I try to buy stamps, twenty is too much for
one stamp, and she can't break bills, and
I can't have them all, I ask to trade stamps,
one for one, she's not sure that's okay,
so she phones a friend; she asks
if I have exact change and I say:
yes! I do.

"This Is Just To Say Something About The Young Housewife" (2023)

I totally ate all of the  so many    fried turkeys
that were hanging out
by the red wheelbarrow
you know     the one glazed with
soy sauce and beside the 
                      kentucky fried 
                             kung pao chickens
           which 
themselves were drenched in
              tabasco sauce

I request neither forgiveness
nor do I intend to apologize for
          my actions 

because 

I spent several hours
of quality time
with a certain young housewife

                    who

braless and dressed in negligee 

          and 

whose wild hair suggested
she spent even more additional
even higher quality time with
both the ice man
and the fish man

       either sequentially 
               or 
              simultaneously 
                     neither would surprise me

left me    breathless    exhausted
as well as      famished

I thought I gave a good
account of myself

but then along came 
          the milkman
and    she             still
   had enough energy 
       for 
    round four

I was there
I saw it all

I'm tired. What do I have due today? I have a few class assignments and a Project due. I've been working on 
the project for days, and I've had a really hard time with it. I'll insert a few iframes below.

5

anyway, I'm kind of lost and don't really know what to do, i need to go over this course material. I don't know why this most 
recent project has monopolized my time. I got tied down with front-end 
aspects that had almost nothing to do with the assignment, and I'm irritated about it.

My new restart version of project 14 did not go as well as I thought it would have gone. I don't know what to do. I'm in a bad mood. 

There are two things that I'm thinking about doing, forking project 14 version 2 to start project 14 version 3, making one more attempt 
at the iframe carousel, and then getting the JSON and asynchronous stuff into project 14.

the other idea is going back to project 14 version 1 and just shoving the 2 additional things into it, it's a mess, but it works, 
and the cleaner version 2 doesn't work.

Irritated.

6

i'm in class right now, and all this new material is going way over my head. I'm tired, and I haven't paid attention in class in weeks. 
most of the time I'm in class trying to figure out past assignments.

7

my nails are. and I swore I just cut them, but they are long enough to be interfering with my ability to type.

8

do I have any money?

9

I'm a little bit lost right now.

10

I'm trying to think. There are a number of things I need to get done today.
I finished project 14, there were a lot of things that I wanted to do with
it, but, I ended up just going with the leaflet integration option, and
even doing that took a mountain of time. I integrated leaflet to my
Hamburgers project, and Connections for Mobile assignment.

I have a few class assignments, and I also have
some kind of professional development project that I have to
do.

and
I think that might be it.

I really don't know what to do about money right now.

[Development Notes]

<!-- check for deployment after a while. this was moved from codepen into vscode and uploaded to GitHub to make this function better.
I really want to update this, maybe even change the look of it. -->

16

I think this was about my chestnut + hazel connections page for project 14.

17

I'm uploading content to my YouTube channel, I'm not sure how exciting these videos are. 
some of these videos are very long, and take a long time to upload as well, and I can't really upload all of them at once because 
my account doesn't have those permissions just yet.

18

my nails aren't that long, but I had to cut them because they are messing with my ability to type again. 

19

I really don't know what to do about money.

Even with as much time as I've spent on this, and seemingly no closer to getting a JSON file working, I seem to have
made a breakthrough with this carousel. The iframes look like they are interactive in a way that they were not interactive
in the original Project 10 version of the carousel.

I'm setting up links to see if the iframes in the carousel work, and if they do, then that means this should work. and I can
get project 14 completed, even though this seems like it was kind of a long digression from the requirements of project 14.

-->

21

I'm spending some time today to work on my blog, as well as my YouTube channel. 
I don't know. I need to do something with these gaming videos, like add 
narration, or, say something, about what I'm thinking, about what some of my 
decisions are when I'm playing. I'm kind of thinking of going with the Vanilla 
version, rather than playing with so many mods, but, if there isn't one annoying 
issue with the game, there is usually some other annoying issue. One thing 
that takes up a lot more time than I would like it to, is the whole business of 
managing the faction and ruling dynasty.

22

This is one of my earlier videos from the channel, when I 
spent time reading poetry and all of that. It's 
interesting to see all of the voice over stuff 
that can be done with text to speech programs. I actually 
saw an advertisement for one that I was really impressed with.

24

"Here's to momma dollar, and poppa dollar!"

25

I don't know what to do about money.

26

This is such a nightmare. Everything.

27

There is an issue with posting youtube 
videos in iframes, they have to 
have /embed/ in the source path. 
headache. I thought that the video just wasn't 
totally live or deployed on YouTube, but it 
might be totally not going to work.

28

 It seems like my upload limit for my YouTube channel is 8 videos 
 for any 24 hour period. Nothing I've produced 
 is particularly interesting, but, I'll come up with something.

29

Total War  ROME 2 Battle of Ephesus

The Spartans are on the warpath throughout Asia 
Minor, no one can stop them, except for the even more amazing 
Roman Military! They will be stopped! Even if they! are! Sparta!

30

I'm spending way too much time playing 
computer games. I'm trying to make something 
out of it by recording videos 
while I play, but the videos I make aren't 
all that amazing.

31

There is something that I'm thinking about right now.
well. sometimes I listen to music or a documentary
while I work on other things. sometimes as an attempt at 
multi-tasking.

but right now it just seems more appropriate to work on 
this epic and fabulous poem of mine!

32

Good Lord! I spent the entire day gaming, the 
entire past few days actually, and I've not 
gotten any real work done, 
or, well, I don't really feel like I've gotten 
any work done.

33

I worked on my blog a little bit, made a few videos of me 
fixing broken links on my blog. I have to work on Project 15, 
and I really haven't even looked at what's required. 
There's an issue with creating an embedded iframe, it's not really
possible to link just the YouTube page into an iframe as a 
regular source, and suddenly I realize why, 
you only want the video, and not the whole page that's on YouTube. 

34

Walking Through The Grass (2019)

I remember walking 
to work, about a mile or so 
to a hotel where I worked, and
I had to walk through the grass
and the grass
was always wet, really wet, and 
my pants would get wet too 
and my boots would get wet 
and my socks would get wet.

36

I spent a lot of time on that project, I really enjoy the end result. I 
still want to make the contact modal work. These are comments removed from my GitHub files.

37

All the videos are now uploaded to YouTube. It took so long. i deleted my miscellaneous 
repository, but then, i created a new miscellaneous repository because I have the index to that 
repository linked elsewhere, so, I didn't want them to break, so I fixed it before it became a problem.

38

These videos that I've uploaded to YouTube today are taking forever to load. This time, I made the 
decision to upload the largest files, rather than whatever random videos occurred to me to upload. 
I figured that I could get these large files out of my 
storage space. but, yeah, they are taking forever to upload.

39

My software development course will be over next week. This comes as kind of a relief, but I'm also 
kind of sad about it, I really enjoyed this class. I don't know how I'm going to continue to stay 
motivated to work on web and software development projects without project being due, everything I 
work on after class will be a self directed project. Yeah, I've been spending way too much, 
mountains of time playing computer games.

40

There is kind of a chicken and egg problem going on here. I need to 
get an MMR vaccine to attend UNLV, I got my first dose something like 
5 years ago when I applied to the MBA program at UNLV, I need to get a 
second dose. I must have left Las Vegas before getting my second dose of 
the MMR vaccine. I thought I took it already when I applied at UTA, but 
the vaccine that UTA required was a meningitis vaccine. The funny thing 
about the UTA thing, the meningitis vaccine, was that they kept sending 
me notices to submit proof of vaccination for meningitis, but when I got 
around to getting the vaccine and uploading proof, it turns out I didn't 
really need to get it, it was for undergrads only. Waste of money.

41

So now I have to figure out how to get the MMR vaccine, the second dose. The 
chicken and egg problem that I'm facing is that I need my MMR vaccine to enroll 
in classes at UNLV, but I have to be enrolled in classes at UNLV to get a Student 
ID card, and use the Student Health Services and get vaccinated. This isn't a huge 
problem, it just means that I have to get vaccinated somewhere else.

42

I was experimenting with layouts for katastrophiena.com, and I really liked 
the layout that I selected, and I actually decided to apply it to 
chestnutandhazel.com. I think that it's really nice, and nothing 
really broke. I recently. I've been making all the measurements 
for the iframes percentage based, all the dimensions percentage 
based, because I figured that I might change layouts from time to 
time, and it seems to have kept things from getting messed up with 
the new layout, or, style.

43
 
I don't know what to do right now. 
I should be working on Project 16 right 
now. It's actually. I don't actually have 
to turn it in, but I should do it because 
I need the experience of doing it, and, 
well, I've just felt a whole lot less motivated lately.

44

My mind is kind of all over the place 
right now. I have a lot of things to worry 
about right now. I'm watching The Untouchables, 
Brian de Palma (1987), and this really is a good 
movie. Class starts in a few minutes. There is 
only one more day of class left, Saturday the 18th, 
but it's just a get-together kind of for the final day of class.

I have this other laptop, a second one, and it's 
extremely slow, and I use it for watching the live course 
via zoom, and I use my main laptop to do the work, but this 
thing, my other laptop, is taking forever to load, it's always 
slow, it's been slow since I bought it, and I'm really 
surprised with how slow it is. I bought it during one of the 
road trips, but, it's really super 
slow. so slow that it hardly functions.

45

I remember these poems from when I moved to Missouri from Las 
Vegas. I remember I didn't find work there for a 
while. In Missouri. I did get a job at the prison in town, 
but then, it wasn't really a job that was suitable 
for me, and, it wasn't a good environment 
for me either. I don't know what to do right now.

46

I'm using VS code right now, working on compiling the Adventures
of Chestnut + Hazel into a unified EPIC poem of the most EPIC 
proportions!

47

I am failing MIS 768. Some of this is my own doing. 
when is it not my own doing? but
one of the things
that makes this first semester different from the
web development course I took with Correlation One
is that I'm working right now. 

48

I decided to take work off during the Fall, but I've 
decided that I can't really afford to do that during the 
spring. Nightmare. 

49

I don't know. like. this might be 
the end of my educational pursuits.

I'm going to post some old poems I wrote, 
probably while I was at Mosaic, or during 
the first few months when I first came to Missouri.

50

I guess you could call it
something of a wooded area.

51

There are trees and stuff and
A little bit of other flora.

52

I really like it.

I want to put all the ashes there
and let the trees absorb the nutrients of
the ashes. Maybe someday there will be
a cure for whatever illness needs curing
in that tree.

53

After we burn the trash, we look for any metal
that we can sell to the scrap yard. Burnt Tires
leave wires of metal that can be sold to the
scarp yard. What metal is it. I don't know.

54

All the gaming videos that I've captured are either being uploaded to my 
Chestnut + Hazel channel, or my personal channel, so that's out of the way, 
but many of the files are very large, and they are taking a long time to 
upload, so I have to find something else to do in the meantime, I was supposed 
to update my browser either today or yesterday, but I forgot to do it, with all 
of this uploading I have to do, I have to keep my browser open. So I basically 
haven't closed it and re-opened it to update my browser.

55

My plans for the next few days are to finish uploading all of my gaming videos 
to my Chestnut + Hazel YouTube channel, and then hold off on gaming for a while. 
I could probably get all of that done today. I have so many videos uploaded already, 
and I think that I have about 20 more that I'm in the process of uploading. I scheduled 
them way out into the future, all the way until the end of 2024 because I didn't want them 
all dropping at once. Once that's done I'm going to focus on putting together my UNLV 
applications. I just noticed something funny, I noticed that when Slack loads, the 
screen says: Reticulating Splines, which is from SimCity.

I have 7 videos left to upload. A lot of these videos have just been sped up with 4x or 
16x to reduce the file size, and make the action happen more quickly.

56

I'm really happy about completing the Software 
Development course, and I'm really proud of 
this. Tomorrow is the last day of class, but it's 
not really a full class. I'm not sure what to do next.

57

Below I've posted an old video of a poetry reading video that I made years ago.

58

I'm not sure what to work on right now. Today is 
Sunday, and everything is kind of a free day for a 
while. I should look for work. Apply for a few positions. 
I made a few game playing videos where I have voice overs or 
narrations what what's going on, and what decisions I'm making. 
Even with the videos sped up to 10x to 16x, there still seems 
to be a lack of things to say.

59

so what am I up to right now? I'm really just making gaming videos and 
uploading them to YouTube. I tried making a YouTube short, but I think my 
video was over budget, time wise. I guess I'll find out. I could have sworn that 
I've seen YouTube shorts that are in the 4 minute range. I bought this down to 1:25 
minutes, but I'm not sure if that's short enough to be a short.

60

I'm feeling worried about the future. 
I went in for my entrance exam for the 
Spanish Translation program, and I don't 
really think that it went well: I didn't 
really study because I spent these last few 
days immersed in my gaming, and didn't do 
anything else really, and now, I'm sick of the 
game, and now I probably have time to do productive 
stuff. Part of the reason I wasn't really motivated 
to study was because I did manage to get accepted into 
the Entrepreneurship and Innovation program, and I already 
enrolled in as many classes as I plan to take, and my 
original goal was to get into one program or the other.

The thing that I'm worried about for the future is money. 
I've been out of work for 4 months, and I also 
haven't had any income, money coming in during 
that time. I tried to sign up for food delivery 
stuff, but that didn't really work. I don't really 
know what to do. I don't know what to do. I really 
don't know what to do. I would like to be working, 
but I really need to find the right role. I need to 
land the right role, the right position.

61

I'm not really looking for an employer right now.
and this comment is related to stanza 60 above,
this is akward because these are written right after
the other, but happened at very different times.
I was looking for a role last year, but not this year. 
four months later.

62

I have an exam tomorrow, and I'm not even really prepared. In 
fact I'm not even really prepared at all. I was working on this 
Spanish Translations project, but it really hasn't gone anywhere, 
and it's not even close to being done. I also have to find work; 
I thought about doing the food delivery and rideshare stuff, but, 
I had an incident today where I concluded that it might not really be 
something that is workable. There are major traffic issues in Las Vegas 
that make driving really frustrating, and I'm not really sure I would be 
able to do it. I still need to find work, though. Or some source of income.

63

there was an employer 
event at UNLV that I would have 
attended, and that I was going to attend.
but I did not attend the event. things weren't 
going well in MIS 768, so I scrapped any plans for 
that week, only for things to really go downhill 
in that class.

64

I shaved, and I think that my face looks a lot nicer than it 
does when I have facial hair, but I didn't shave my head, but 
I still think that I look a lot nicer when I have my face shaved. 
I exfoliated, and I had a lot of dead skin and all that. It was 
really kind of gross, but I was really happy to get my face clean. 
I worked on my translations project. 

The favicon stuff is annoying. sizing and stretching things. making 
it look right it the browser tab. important. but annoying.

65

I've been kind of not really doing anything lately. Nothing, other than playing on the computer, 
and really just playing from the start over and over, again and again. I bought a phone mount, 
like the kind for my car, but I mounted it on my wall next to my desk. This is kind of cool, and 
I've been thinking about doing this for a while, but didn't do it, because I didn't really want to 
spend the money on something like this, but it really helps because I usually watch movies on my 
phone, rather than my computer, and when my phone is just sitting on my desk I can't really see 
what's going on on-screen.

I have 1 more class I need to enroll in at UNLV. Just like at UTA, I have to request permission 
for pretty much every class I try to enroll in. I'm not sure how long I should wait before 
reaching out a second time. The annoying thing is, is that I didn't realize before hand that 
I needed to request permission for every class I need to take, so I didn't ask permission for 
both classes the first time, I only requested permission for the one class I thought that I 
needed to request permission for. I thought the other class didn't require it, so I'm waiting 
for the other class to be unlocked.

Spring (2023)

Translated from Primaveral (1888) by Rubén Darío

During the blossoming months, my
rhymes run in circles through a vast
forest to collect nectar and
aromatics from blooming flowers.

Come, my love! to our place: the hallowed
grove where an ambience of love floats
above the aromas of the foliage of Spring.

A bird flies from tree to tree and
greets you, and your face, blushing
and as beautiful as the dawn and the
superb oaks, tall and robust,

tremble as you walk by, its leaves
shake and its branches rise to give
way to the queen. My Love! It's the
sweet spring season.

67

There are a number of challenges I'm facing when it comes to monetizing my blogs 
or my other content. There are a whole bunch of Search Console issues that I'm not 
clear about how to fix, and then there are minimum viewer requirements on YouTube 
that will take a while to complete, and then there are content issues with Blogger 
that aren't really clear to me how to resolve.

68

I want to get a new gaming laptop, but I have to wait until next year. One that 
meets the minimum requirements for the games I'm looking to play, even the new 
ones, doesn't look too expensive, it's more than I would normally spend on a 
laptop for general use, but it seems less than what gaming laptops costs, or, 
what I'm used to seeing gaming laptops cost. One of the things I'm not too sure 
about is how long the deal will last, or if 
gaming laptops should drop in general later on.

I'm trying to turn my gaming into something like a business, but, yeah, I don't 
fully know how to do that. I seem to be getting more attention my my regular 
YouTube channel when compared to my Chestnut + Hazel YouTube channel.

69

These posts. and this is just a note. these stanzas, although 
they are numbered sequentially, the events they refer to are not 
in. they are not necessarily in chronological order.  

they might not even be in the order 
they were originally published in. and not in the order 
they were originally written in. so. good luck to anyone 
who read this.

There
are no words to 
describe
the agony of
eating too much
food at the buffet
when you go to
the buffet 
and eat all 
that you can eat.

There was a place that i came across 
today while I was out DoorDashing, 
and it was a place called ONO or 
something. Ono Sushi. I just looked 
it up. I think that I might want to eat there.

71

I did food delivery work today. I delivered 1 meal. It didn't take long to 
get the first order, but after that order, the zone I was working in dried 
up, so I switched zones, once I got there, there weren't really any orders 
to pick up, so I figured there wasn't really much work that day, so I went 
home. I've very rarely been able to make delivering food profitable.

72

If she asks me 
why I wasn't able to 
get anything done while 
she was away, I will tell her 
the truth: I was thinking about 
you, and when I think about you, 
when I started thinking about you 
I couldn't stop masterbating.
so I fell asleep. afterward.

77

I deleted my facebook, instagram, twitter (X), and 
linkedin accounts. I also think that deleted a 
number of other social media accounts as well, 
Pinterest. I'm not sure I really used that account.

One of the things that sometimes worried me about using. 
one of the things that often worried me about deleting 
these accounts is that. Maybe. someone might create a 
fake account using my name and all that. I don't know. 
I won't worry about that right now. I'm honestly. really. 
I'm surprised how many other Ken Yamat, and kenneth Yamat 
profiles are out there. I guess my name isn't all that 
special after all.

78

Door Dashing really can be a challenge. 
and. it's not always just a simple game of 
picking up and dropping off food.

i. honestly. really wish it was that easy.

79

Um. So I did Door Dash today, I had one order. 
for like 3 hours of driving, and I'm somewhat 
discouraged. After spending all that money to obtain 
business licenses, and getting a commercial auto policy 
that's way more expensive than what I was paying for a 
personal policy. I'm, you know. Not sure what to do.

The order that I did get was somewhat accidental, I was 
toggling between per order and per hours just to check 
it out, and the order I got was a per hour order.

and I'm thinking, it might make sense to switch between 
the two during certain times of the day. The traffic was 
really bad in whatever area I was in.

Anyway. I called it a day after trying for 3 hours, and only 
getting one order. Some days are better than others, and I think. 
on days where it seems like slim pickings, it might make sense 
to just go back home and work on something else.

80

Today. and I'm referring to the 18th, I often stay up 
overnight. Today wasn't a very fruitful day in terms of 
Door Dashing. The weekend wasn't as much of a money maker 
as I thought it would have been.

My conclusion is that it might be better to start later on 
in the day. Maybe around 8:00 PM or something. I've been 
pushing my start times back further and further. I 
thought 4:00 PM was already somewhat late.

If I'm going to work nights, then I need to buy a jacket.

82

DoorDashing. yeah. I'm really not looking 
for an employer right now. being self-employed 
is a challenge, but. I'm just really not looking 
for an employer right now.

83

I managed to buy a jacket today.

84

Money hasn't been this tight in a while, but there is 
one positive thing. I think that I'm able to stop pulling 
money out of my savings, and eventually, to start paying 
down my credit balances.

85

Life is extremely challenging right now.

86

I went on a road trip. not a very exciting one, but, 
I don't know. I'm in a slightly better mood than before. 
I went from Las Vegas, to San Diego, to Yuma, and back to Vegas.

87

Really not looking for an employer right now. I'm really not.

I went on a road trip. not a very exciting one, but, I don't

Las Vegas, to San Diego, to Yuma, and back to Vegas.

88

My focus right now is to work on my 
catalog of intellectual property.
my focus is not to find an employer.

89

If I were still filing a continued unemployment claim 
I probably would be looking for an employer, but since I'm 
not filing a claim, I'm not looking!

I went on a road trip. not a very exciting one, 
but, I don't know. I'm in a slightly better mood

91

as far as MIS 768 goes. I'm just not really sure 
what to do right now. and what I mean is:
I know that I'm failing the course. I know that I 
will have to audit the course. what I'm trying 
to figure out is how to salvage this situation? 
how do I, you know, still get something for the 
money I paid to take the course?

92

A few days ago I took a road trip from 
Las Vegas, to San Diego, to Yuma, and back 
to Las Vegas. San Diego reminds me of Austin, 
just older and larger.

93

There is a convention from MIS 768 that I like, and it's this:

/*		
Author's Name: 		    	Kenneth Larot Yamat

Purpose of Program:			To calculate the shipping 
                            cost of a parcel at a 
                            parcel service store
                        
Date Due:					March 3rd, 2024
*/

94

I don't know how I would use that in this document.
this is going to be registered as a Poem, like an Epic Poem 
of ancient antiquity!

95

Life is something of a 
nightmare right now.

I thought the bleeding would 
stop, that I'd get my 
budget in order during December, 
but that is something that did not happen.

I don't even want to make any remarks 
about what I anticipate for January, 
out of a fear that I might jinx it.

96

// /**/System.out.println(" Data for Package # 1"); // entryNumber// this number

School starts soon. Later on 
in the month. There are a few 
things I need to get done to prepare, 
but I've been so busy doing DoorDash 
that I haven't exactly come around to 
it, but I have to get it done today.

99

I'm in a really lousy mood right now. 
I'm kind of stressed out. I'm kind of 
frustrated about things right now.

I managed to finish quite a bit of the 
required tasks for school. Mostly 
orientation related tasks and online 
modules.

I need to go out Door Dashing and all that, 
but I'm really tired right now, but it's 
kind of a mood related fatigue.

100

When something is published. When something 
is pushed to GitHub. I really do considered 
published. because. it's avaiable to the 
public. it's just that not many people 
are on, you know digging around in repositories
reading text files and all that.

but I do consider this published.

Back in November I bought a vape pen a refillable one 
after trying the disposable vape pens for a while and this 
thing will not stop leaking I don't know what to do I'm 
thinking about getting a different type of vape pen I'm 
not sure I really like the disposable vape pens but it's 
primarily based on cost because the disposables are 
just so expensive

School has started and yesterday was our first day of orientation 
this semester I'm taking two classes both of them are MIS classes

I'm enrolled in the entrepreneurship program I'm not sure 
what kind of business I would start if I were to start one 
the other day I was trying to buy clothes and I just have 
so many problems with getting the correct fit and if I were 
to start something it would be like some kind of clothes 
business I thought about buying a sewing machine because 
like my pants are just too damn long but I don't know if 
I really want to start sewing stuff because it's such a 
headache I have all these pants that just don't fit and 
it never really mattered because I always wore boots so 
like if if my pants were too long it wasn't really a 
problem and I really didn't notice.

I'm using text to speech to write this. I don't really 
get much time to sit down and type so finding this feature 
on my phone has turned out to be really useful. nothing is 
punctuated and I guess that's just the way text to speech 
works, but I could always go back and punctuate this if I need to.

There are a few things that I realized while I was door 
dashing that made me start to use text to speech one of 
the things was that I can't really type if I'm driving 
but if I use the phone if somebody wants to access what 
I have to say they have to access their voicemail box 
like if I leave a message and so it just made more sense 
to use text to speech and send it by text the way they 
could just read whatever I said it's not like I'm really 
saying anything to complex when I'm using text to speech 
for the most part anyway

A while ago I think I wrote about how I wanted to buy 
a jacket and what ended up happening is that I ended 
up buying two sweaters two jackets and four pairs of 
pants after buying the sweaters I realized that I don't 
really like sweaters and part of the reason for that is 
that with jackets I have a jacket pocket and I don't really 
like having so many things in my pants pockets so I bought 
these sweaters and I'm not really planning on using them

I really like the sweaters but from a usefulness 
standpoint I just don't anticipate 
ever really wearing them

103

classes start on the 16th. the two orientation 
classes are over. I wore a tie for the second day, 
but, it was mostly for getting a portrait photograph 
taken, but, I seem to have missed it. I guess I thought 
that there would be a kind of designated time to get our 
portrait photos taken, but, it was more of whenever you 
have the opportunity to get one kind of deal. and. yeah, i missed it.

105

I bought a new toilet seat. The wood ones were 
less expensive than the plastic ones, which was nice, 
so, I bought a wood one.

106

I'm trying to think.

107

I bought a parking pass. I think that I only 
have class once a week, and it's after parking 
enforcement hours. so maybe I didn't really need to 
pay for a parking permit, but then again, I might be on 
campus to do this or that, and, I'm going to apply for 
positions on campus, so I might use it.

I need to get a new phone, my current phone is cracked, 
and, it's also kind of falling apart.

109

I finally bought a new phone. My last one 
cracked not too long after I bought it. It 
was weird because I hadn't cracked a phone 
that soon after buying it in a while. I think 
I had it for 7 months. My last phone was really 
falling apart, it wasn't just cracked.

110

I'm really frustrated right 
now. I really feel like 
going on a short road trip 
to blow off some steam, but 
I kind of scheduled an appointment 
for Monday, but there was no 
confirmation on the other side, so.

and

today is 
already monday.

so. a road trip is 
kind of out of the 
question right now.

and

i have to be prudent 
about how i waste my time.

maybe i could go out and

eat something ridiculous, but
i don't know of anything ridiculous
that's open at 3 AM.

the only kind of food that's available
at 3 AM is basically totally normal
kinds of food.

Let's see:

Hitchin' Post Saloon

I've actually been wanting to eat 
here for a while, but, I think this 
is some kind of steakhouse or something, 
and that's pretty much normal food.

Bourbon Street Sports Bar

I've eaten here before, and I think I spent like 30 bucks. 
I don't mind spending 30 bucks on a meal, but the meal 
has to be worth 30 bucks, and whatever I ate here really 
wasn't worth 30 bucks.

Northstar Bar and Grill

this place is close, but I think it's just 
normal food.

there are a number of taco stands and taco trucks, 
the last time I went to a taco stand I spent 47 
dollars. i think I ate 18 tacos, it was some 
multiple of 6. I think it was 14 tacos actually.

I want to eat some kind of
fish.

I'm still in a really lousy mood right now.

i'm trying to think.

I want to eat indian food.

Delhi Indian & Nepali Cuisine Express

the building that's on google maps 
isn't really all that sexy.
but the address

333 W St Louis Ave, Las Vegas, NV 89102

I basically have to eat there now.
and here's why

333 is simply one of my favorite numbers.

and west saint louis just kills me because

kansas city is in the west and saint louis is on the 
eastern part of missouri. kansas city is part kansas and 
part missouri, and saint louis is part missouri and part illinois.

place isn't open right now though.

oh. I realize what this is.

it's a
Virtual restaurant

it's basically doordash only kind of orders. 
like it basically only exists to fulfill doordash orders.

I'm still trying to think.

at this point i'm not even hungry anymore.

i'm in slightly less of a bad mood.

111

good god.

i need to get something to eat

i'm not hungry really

i'm just not really in much of a good mood.

i'm in a really garbage kind of mood.

i'm not even hungry.
and
eating something is not really
a solution

but i can't really think of anything else 
i enjoy doing

i don't feel hungry

112

so i ended up at saffron flavors of india

113

this is one of the few times i've ever 
successfully fixed a Google Search Console 
issue. but this also comes with . this also 
came with a seperate email stating that i 
had not resolved some other - seperate 
google search console issue.

114

i have to watch what i eat when i go out. i really
feel like i ate too much.
i have to get these small assignments done.
I don't know what to do for money. I haven't interviewed for anything in a while.

[Development Commentary]

<!-- [11/04/2023 23:10] Create a link for Chestnut and Hazel Connection, Mobile Version -->

Sometimes when I go into interviews it's not clear to me if the interviewer 
is just looking to kill time, or if they are actually looking to fill the 
role. When I went into this interview with Copart, it felt like the interviewer 
only had the intention of mocking my work history, and like, she didn't start the 
interview until an hour or so after the scheduled time.

I'm still really angry that my unemployment claim was denied, 
and that I'm not getting paid out on it.

but.

if they aren't going to pay me, then I almost see no reason to look for work.
I'll keep looking as long as I have an appeal outstanding, but, in many ways it
feels like looking for work is a total waste of my time.

I'm worried about running out of money before I get into college. 
I can't seem to put together
enough letters of recommendation, and, this is a real nightmare. A real nightmare.

I can't really leave Las Vegas, and UNLV is the only college in Las Vegas 
that has a graduate school.
All the programs at UNLV require more letters of recommendation that I can 
reasonably put together,
and. I don't know.

Total War ROME 2: Battle of Pella (2023) During the Macedonian wars of 209 BC The 
Julian Dynasty takes the bold move to attack the Macedonians at the very heart of 
their empire: The Capital of Pella. Defended by their own world renowned Macedonian 
warriors, and reinforced by their Epirot and Spartan allies, the Capital of Pella 
makes for a difficult battle, over the course of three separate major assaults on 
the city, Pella is finally captured by none other than Sextus Nerva himself.

I had to get 
rid of a bunch 
of this stuff for 
some reason.

115

I don't why my life always goes 
straight to hell every now and then.

116

what a nightmare. a total nightmare. 
I don't know what else to say. things 
are not going the way that I want them 
to. headache. nightmare. life oscillates 
between being a headache, to a nightmare, 
and back.

117

I'm not sure what to work on right now. 
Today is Sunday, and everything is kind of a 
free day for a while. I should look for work. 
Apply for a few positions. I made a few game 
playing videos where I have voice overs or 
narrations what what's going on, and what 
decisions I'm making. Even with the videos 
sped up to 10x to 16x, there still seems to 
be a lack of things to say.

119

so what am I up to right now? I'm really 
just making gaming videos and uploading them 
to YouTube. I tried making a YouTube short, 
but I think my video was over budget, time wise. 
I guess I'll find out. I could have sworn that 
I've seen YouTube shorts that are in the 4 minute 
range. I bought this down to 1:25 minutes, but I'm 
not sure if that's short enough to be a short.

120

I am failing MIS 768 right now. really 
hard too. I applied for the computer Science 
program, and. if i'm failing an MIS course. then.
well.

121

I've added some content below from my Spanish Translations 
project. I've recently got bogged down messing around with 
an old project that doesn't seem to work in it's new area. 
I don't know what's going on, or why it doesn't work except 
on my landing page. I did get rid of something that was 
making it kind of a headache, and the thing was the 
transform hover effect.

122

I'm going to forget about messing around with fixing the
project 11 contact form, for whatever reason, it does not
work. It's the same thing as what i have on my landing page,
so I don't know why it doesn't work. so dumb. I might try one
more thing. but then again, I really have to work on my
translations project, and this is just something I'm messing
around with.

123

I'm putting together the texts that I'll be translating for
this project. I'm also working on my YouTube videos. For video
editing, I'm mostly just consolidating and speeding up videos
and adding music, and uploading them, and I can't really do this
while playing the games themselves because my computer slows down
a lot.

Buying a new gaming laptop is something that I thought about, but
I think that I'll wait to do it. A gaming computer that can play
the games I want to play doesn't look too expensive, but I really
have to wait to spend that kind of money right now.


Two Spanish Language Authors have been replaced

César Vallejo with José de Espronceda
&
Pablo Neruda with Antonio Machado

I created a few additional JavaScript functions to allow
the contact forms to be visible inside the iframe and clickable
inside the list.

124

I think that everything has been set up, once everything is
deployed, then I can focus on making translations for the
pages that I've set up.

125

So I set up the .md files for the four authors that I'm going
to translate from English to Spanish, and the four authors
that I'm going to translate from Spanish to English. I selected
all authors whose work I expect to be in the Public Domain.

126

VS Code is such a great too. even 
for editing non-computer code 
documents.

127

Getting the Readme iframe and Document Title swap to work is complete,
the next stage in this project is to pick 4 authors to translate.

I'll pick four authors to translate from English to Spanish,
and 4 authors to translate from Spanish to English.

For English to Spanish:

William Carlos Williams
T. S. Eliot
Wallace Stevens
E. E. Cummings

For Spanish to English:

Rubén Darío
César Vallejo
Pablo Neruda
Miguel de Unamuno

128

This is awesome! it actually works, the title and the document
change when clicked! I'm going to come back around to this and
continue to work on it later.

129

There are a few other things that I need to work on, 
I need to set up katastrophiena to be eligible for 
AdSense, and, I think that the main thing is that 
I need a longer history of posts for this blog. This 
might take a while, and take away from all the other 
things that I'm working on. Anyway. I'm getting sucked 
into computer gaming right now, not with any games that 
are new, but games that I've had for a long time. I've 
been thinking about buying a gaming laptop, something 
inexpensive, and I came across one, but, I really 
have to hold out on buying anything like that right now.

I have to wait before spending money on something 
like a new laptop, at least until next year.

130

I'm working on a number of things right now. 
One is setting up a page on GitHub Pages for 
my Spanish Translations Project. I was having 
trouble with a contact forms section of my page, 
this isn't needed for my Translations Page, I just 
set it up so it works, or, I'm just been trying to 
make the links work. Basically, I took Project 16, 
my Project 16 page, and used it as a starting point 
for my Spanish Translations Project. One of the things 
I left from the old page and kept on the new page was 
a section for Contact Forms that I made throughout the 
course I took. There is one Contact Form that just doesn't 
really work. It's the one from Project 11 I don't know 
what wrong.

and I'm really not in the mood to work on it because. 
I just really don't really want to work on it right 
now. So I guess I wont.

131

There is one thing that I have found that helps 
with the video uploading process, for longer videos, 
it makes sense to speed up the video all the way up to 
16x speed, and the reason why is that, videos longer 
than an hour, and even longer than 10 minutes, are 
really slow paced, and it's much easier to get an 
idea of what's happening when the video is moving 
faster. This also reduces the file size, and makes 
uploading quicker.

There are some games that are really slow paced, 
like the tower game that I'm playing, but also, 
the same is true for many other city building games as well.

132

I need to come up with a better workflow for uploading 
gaming videos to YouTube. They take a hell of a long 
time to upload, especially larger files, I would reduce 
the file size, but it's not really clear to me how to do 
that. There is an issue with gaming videos, they often 
need to be high resolution, a lot of these videos need to 
be high resolution, I don't even have a very large screen 
on my laptop, and in many cases, the videos seem to be 
blurry. On the other hand, I'm not sure if these are 
going to be viewed mainly on a large screen, or a small 
screen, like a phone.

133

I'm thinking about how everything seems to have been falling 
apart for me over these past few months. I lost my job, I 
haven't found a new one, and I'm burning through my money. 
I'm a little bit demotivated. or unmotivated. or just basically 
lacking very much or even any motivation. I'm cutting it close 
it terms of money. I need to find work. Land a job or something.
 
The Internet connection here is slow, it's not normally this 
slow, but for whatever reason, it's slower than syrup. I'm 
working on a number of things right now, but I'm also kind 
of bouncing around mentally from idea to idea, from worry to 
worry.

Somewhere in the back of my mind I'm wondering if I'm cursed 
or something. Like, there's nothing I can do, and this is just 
the way things are going to go for me, but I have no idea why 
I would be cursed, or what would be the cause of the curse, or 
why I would be cursed, or who would want to place a curse on me.

134

I've added some content below from my Spanish Translations project. 
I've recently got bogged down messing around with an old project that

137

I haven't even looked at the Spanish Translation 
project in a while. After not passing the Spanish Entrance 
exam I more or less figured I would put it on the back burner.

a long time. I've been thinking about buying a gaming laptop, 
something inexpensive, and I came across one, but, I really 
have to hold out on buying anything like that right now.

I have to wait before spending money on something like a new 
laptop, at least until next year.

142

I'm working on a number of things right now. One is setting up 
a page on GitHub Pages for my Spanish Translations Project. I 
was having trouble with a contact forms section of my page, 
this isn't needed for my Translations Page, I just set it up 
so it works, or, I'm just been trying to make the links work. 
Basically, I took Project 16, my Project 16 page, and used it 
as a starting point for my Spanish Translations Project. One 
of the things I left from the old page and kept on the new page 
was a section for Contact Forms that I made throughout the course 
I took. There is one Contact Form that just doesn't really work. 
It's the one from Project 11 I don't know what wrong.

and I'm really not in the mood to work on it because. I just really 
don't really want to work on it right now. So I guess I wont.

143

There is one thing that I have found that helps with the video uploading 
process, for longer videos, it makes sense to speed up the video all the 
way up to 16x speed, and the reason why is that, videos longer than an 
hour, and even longer than 10 minutes, are really slow paced, and it's 
much easier to get an idea of what's happening when the video is moving 
faster. This also reduces the file size, and makes uploading quicker.

There are some games that are really slow paced, like the tower game 
that I'm playing, but also, the same is true for many other city 
building games as well.

144

I need to come up with a better workflow for uploading gaming videos 
to YouTube. They take a hell of a long time to upload, especially 
larger files, I would reduce the file size, but it's not really clear 
to me how to do that. There is an issue with gaming videos, they often 
need to be high resolution, a lot of these videos need to be high 
resolution, I don't even have a very large screen on my laptop, 
and in many cases, the videos seem to be blurry. On the other hand, 
I'm not sure if these are going to be viewed mainly on a large 
screen, or a small screen, like a phone.

145

I'm thinking about how everything seems to have been falling apart 
for me over these past few months. I lost my job, I haven't found 
a new one, and I'm burning through my money. I'm a little bit 
demotivated. or unmotivated. or just basically lacking very much 
or even any motivation. I'm cutting it close it terms of money. 
I need to find work. Land a job or something.
 
The Internet connection here is slow, it's not normally this slow, 
but for whatever reason, it's slower than syrup. I'm working on a 
number of things right now, but I'm also kind of bouncing around 
mentally from idea to idea, from worry to worry.

Somewhere in the back of my mind I'm wondering if I'm cursed or something. 
Like, there's nothing I can do, and this is just the way things are going 
to go for me, but I have no idea why I would be cursed, or what would be the 
cause of the curse, or why I would be cursed, or who would want to place a 
curse on me.

One of the issues I have with what I post on chestnutandhazel.com is that It's hosted, or whatever, it's really just an account
on blogger.com, so since it's basically a social media account, I have to comply with the community guidles of blogger.com, and
since I have adsense active on that page, I also have to comply with any adsense advertiser standards, so I have my hands tied 
in many respects. chestnutandhazel.com continues to get flagged over and over and over, and in many cases I don't really want to 
deal with it right away.

the other issue is that I also have to post what I write somewhere, so that I can use the standard copyright registration form,
rather than the unpublished copyright registration form, so, that's another issue. so you know, it's kind of whatever.

I'm feeling incredibly scatter brained. I have a project 
due for my software and web development course today, and 
I haven't even started. This should be simple, so I'm not 
too worried about it, but, at the same time, I know from 
the past that these things could take quite a while if I 
hit a brick wall.

There are other issues that I'm facing, especially on the 
income front. The temp assignment was not a particularly 
good fit, and, I really get the feeling that I should avoid 
any kind of warehouse or factory work, even though, that's 
sort of what I've been doing for the past five years, but I 
don't have the slightest clue what to look for.

Life is such an unbelievable struggle. I don't really know 
what to do about money. Somewhere in the back of my mind 
there's this voice telling me that I should stop looking 
for a job or employment or whatever, and, that I should 
focus on trying to make money doing stock market shit.

Reflection # 714 by Chestnut and Hazel

I don't know exactly what I've been spending on buying lunch and soda at work, 
but I know that it is too damn much, I want to say it is around 15 dollars per day. 
Too fucking much. I have to cut down on that for sure.

By Chestnut + Hazel at June 11, 2019 

Notes written on 10/10/2023 @ 10:19 AM, 
originally posted on GitHub

I think that I wrote this post while I was working 
at Case New Holland. I'm surprised that I was 
really spending that much. I 
Wonder what I was buying? I don't really remember. 
I think that it was mostly energy drinks. I don't 
remember my exact hours. 
It was overnight is as much as I remember. In 
Cameron, MO there isn't really much to eat if 
you're up at odd hours.

I'm working on Project 11 for my Web and Software 
Development course. I'm not really getting much 
done. I'm getting sidetracked
with other things. I'm really amazed that I get so 
little done, especially considering that I've had 
few other obligations other
than class these past few months. I really 
wonder what I've been doing.

Earlier in the course I would have a 
lot of fun playing around with our 
daily assignments, but, I haven't really 
done that in a
while, even though there have been plenty 
of opportunities to do so.

155

I don't really remember what those
old posts are about.

156

not off the top of my head anyway.

157

Life is such a nightmare right now. My expenses have increased, 
and my income has decreased, and I'm really not seeing any 
kind of light at the end of the tunnel.

Life is such a nightmare, but I'm not sure it's really ever been easy.

158

I'm trying to think. Today is Sunday. I feel like I wasted the 
entire day. In fact, it's actually already Monday.

159

I kind of blew off one of my professional development projects, the 
last one, but I didn't realize that it was required for passing the 
course, so I requested a redo of that project.

160

I feel like there is something that I need to do 
right now, but I'm not sure what that is.

161

I'm failing MIS 768
I'm going to audit MIS 768
I don't know if the instructor would 
allow me to re-take the course, but 
even if she did, I don't know if I can 
take a risk like that again. 

162

I feel like there is something 
that I need to do right now, 
but I'm not sure what that is.

163

I was thinking about the 
aphorism: "the hardest part is getting started"

i thought that it was actually 
a quote from Robert Coover's short 
story "In be one night and other brief encounters"

but um it's something people actually 
say, you know, people say that the hardest 
part is getting started.

anyway

the more i thought about it
the more
i thought that

you know
that it could mean two things

on the one hand. it could mean that
the most difficult part in any process is 
getting the process started

and also
that 

the most difficult part of the process is about to get started.

i'm working on project 9 for my class. i'm almost done.
the hardest part. was actually realizing the fact that I 
have to reference my javascript file in the body of my html 
file, and not the head. it was working fine, but, um. the 

i'm taking a break.

164

I should be starting a new position 
soon. Thank god. I've been bored out 
of my mind, and kind of losing focus. 
it's been about a month and three weeks.

165

I'm so tired. My sleep cycle has shifted over the 
past few weeks. I'm still worried about not landing 
a position yet. I'm depleting my savings, and for me, 
that's not really ideal.

166

I still haven't landed a position yet, and I'm under a 
little bit of stress as a result. I can't believe I 
didn't get approved for unemployment.

167

best of all the places you've been
are better than the places you haven't been.
and you won't go anywhere new for the foreseeable future.

now and then you will
find something interesting.
and most of all they are more interesting
than the things that you haven't come across.

and you will drive across the country and find new things
that are interesting
and that you will be happy to see and 
you will enjoy them.

I know what to do now, like going 
forward and stuff. I'm going to say this:


"Yeah, I know a whole bunch of stuff, 
all the craziest dirt and everything. 
Basically. I have all the information 
you need, even the things that other 
people don't know, and even the things 
that other people couldn't even imagine."

maybe you know the things that you haven't
already learned so you will learn them.

here
and again
you see it over and
over and think that
the new things are
nonsensical, but they
actually make sense.

168

what is one of the things that makes Door Dashing hard?
customers who say they never got their order. 
one thing that almost all of the refund fraudsters that I've 
had to deal with is that during the drop off, they make 
a variation to the original instructions. if they say they 
want it to be a contactless delivery, you'll see them standing 
right at the door or at the street waiting for there order, or 
if they say hand it to me, they ask you to leave it at there door.

169

I don't really have much to write about. 
I'm writing because. I guess. I want to keep this 
updated, but I really don't have anything to write 
about. I had a few interview over the past few weeks, 
but, nothing has really materialized.

170


Where are the times
that the people who
where here
are not here anymore

when they left to the other side of the
universe.

171

I removed Steam from my taskbar. Nightmare. I can't get 
anything done when I get so distracted by other useless 
stuff. This is silly, but I have to stay off there. 
There are other things that I could be doing, and should be doing.

The current module in class is WordPress. I had trouble, or, 
maybe just hesitation at first, but it's actually a whole lot 
easier than I initially thought, so I'm not as overwhelmed as 
I was at first. It's not always clear what I'm doing is basically 
my issue with WordPress, but, I almost want to say it's the same 
way when I make pages using HTML and CSS to make them, it's just 
that I've gotten more familiar creating pages by writing them, 
and grabbing and dragging is somewhat new.

172

What do I have to do? I don't have any major assignments 
due tomorrow, but I have to get these modules on WordPress 
done because we are going to move into new content.

173

For some reason I can't seem to really get my thoughts together 
to get very much of my course work done. I did get the last two 
projects completed, but only after quite a bit of procrastination, 
followed by quite a bit of pressure from an impending due date. I'm 
not really behind, but I'm not really ahead, and I'm not really 
getting ahead.

The pressure to land a position is increasing. It isn't clear to me 
where I stand with the temp agency, I did get new hire paperwork, but, 
I'm not sure if that necessarily means I have a position, or a paid 
assignment just yet. I've only worked with a temp agency a few other 
times. Each one is kind of different.

178

I managed to get my project finished, although, 
not without a lot of procrastination. For some 
reason I keep getting sucked-in to playing 
computer games. Huge waste of time. Today is 
after Labor Day. I had an interview with a temp 
agency and a logistics company the other day, but, 
I don't know where I stand. I'll follow up when I get a chance.

I get less and less enthusiastic about this 
blog as time goes on. Well, maybe that's not totally 
true. I guess. I just really have less time for it right now.

179

I'm getting worried about coming up on a 
second month out-of-work. I didn't get 
approved for unemployment, so, I'm basically 
just staying home for now. Not doing anything 
other than my course work and. I did a little 
day trading yesterday, but, it didn't amount to 
much. I didn't lose anything, and that's always good.

Caffeine keeps me up, 
but it doesn't give me 
motivation. I've been 
procrastinating with some 
of the stuff for class.

180

Today is labor day and I've stayed 
up overnight, and I haven't had any 
sleep, and I haven't got any work done.

181

Today is the first day in a long while 
that I've been up during the day, where 
it wasn't, where I wasn't just carrying 
on from the night before. I'm still worried 
about the next few weeks and months, since, 
I'm not working, but I'm not as stressed out 
about it as I usually am, or, as stressed out 
about it as I was a while ago. I almost had 
an interview the other day, but the recruiter 
never confirmed the interview date and time. 
I thought about just showing up, but then, 
I later thought it would be weird.

183

I missed my appointment with my career counselor 
the other day, and I was so tired, that I didn't 
show up for class, even though it was just a Zoom 
session. Same thing, I was playing Sim City, and 
that was an issue, and the other thing was that I 
was staying up late trying to set up my GitHub 
website, it took forever, and the issue turned 
out nothing that I was able to fix, the issue was 
that my account was messed up, so I had to create 
a new account. I don't know what the specific cause 
of the issue was, but as far as I can tell, it had 
something to do with the email address that I used 
to sign up for an account. It's less likely to get 
flagged if you use something like a signup with a 
Gmail account. So that's what I did, the other issue 
may have been with my account name, which had hyphens. 
and it was really long as well.

184

I've been wasting a little bit of time playing 
Sim City. Well. It's actually a lot of time that 
I've wasted playing the game. I've been in an 
unhappy mood these last few days, and I'm not 
really in any position to do anything super 
interesting. My fortune cookie the other day. 
I went out for Chinese food. Said: There are no 
bad journeys, only lessons learned. I don't know 
if that was supposed to encourage me or what.

185

I'm feeling a little better than I was earlier. 
I've applied for a few more roles. a few more positions. 
I'm worried about things. about the next few months. I'm 
annoyed by how often. like. my plans to get ahead always 
seem to hit a brick wall. things just aren't really easy 
for me. this is such a headache. such a disappointment. 
I'm feeling somewhat discouraged.
 
186

My head is in a million different places 
right now. I'm in such an absolute funk right now.

187

I have my hearing today. yet another nightmare. 
I'm frustrated right now. Irritated.

188

I'm so tired. I don't think that I really 
did anything today. after the first application, 
I went on to complete 2 more, and an assessment. 
I went to the buffet around the corner. I don't 
know. I feel like I do the same stuff over and 
over. but oh well. I guess that's the way it is for now.

I don't know why I didn't but more sodas when 
I was at the gas station earlier. Right now 
I'm more thirsty than I've ever been. So thirsty.

Guess what? I drank water! it was so good.

I'm in a weird mood.

Everything is kind of a 
nightmare right now. like 
a real nightmare. I wish 
things we easy. or at least. easier.

One thing I made easier for myself 
is to keep my keyboard backlight on. 
this is nice. since I'm always up at 
night. during the day, though, I'm always 
working kind of in the dark.

What do I still want? Like. Is there anything 
I still want that I've wanted for a while.

189

I submitted 1 application 
today. i think one of the 
things that kind of makes me nervous 
is when there are a number of programs 
or applications listed in the post that 
I'm not familiar with. A lot of these 
positions, or, at least the positions 
that stick out to me, have to do with 
casino games, or slot machines.

190

I need to look for work, and I need to 
find something, I need to land something. 
I feel a little bit worried. well. I actually 
feel a little more than just a little worried. 
I haven't looked for work or applied for a job in  
a while.

191

I need to land a job, and I'm 
starting to worry about it. I 
need something that pays. like 
real money.

192

Some things are just too weird. 
some coincidences are just too 
coincidental. sometimes things 
line up in strange ways that seem. 
weird. like i wonder how that happened.

193

Version 4 - 7 of my project is 
responsive. It fits mobile screens.

194

I was able to find something to eat.

195

It's midnight and I'm really 
kind of hungry. I want to go 
out to eat, I want to find 
something to eat.

196

I don't really have much to write 
about. I've just been working on 
my coursework and assignments and 
projects for my class. I've been 
basically goofing off with this 
Jennifer Connelly project. All day, 
and a few hours from the previous day. 
I think that I worked overnight on this.

197

I don't know what to do about my MIS 768 
Repository. I'm thinking about dismatleing it 
and relocating the material to my main repository.

198

I need to land a job,

I've been basically goofing off with this

few hours from the previous day. I think 
that I worked overnight on this.

204

I created an aspect ratio of 8.68 / 6.08

205

I'm not really in a good mood. I'm tired. 
I'm cranky. I'm worried about the future 
and all that. This is a headache.

206

I'm super tired. I didn't really do 
anything today. I attended class, 
which is via Zoom, so, it's not like 
that's really physically demanding, 
but, I'm otherwise really tired.

207

I don't. a little bit of hard stuff. 
trouble. this is difficult. nightmare.

208

I woke up at around 2 PM this afternoon. 
I was really tired, so I went to the buffet 
to go out and eat. I bought and drank a 
few energy drinks, but I'm not any more 
energized or awake than I was 2 hours ago, 
it's 4 PM as I am writing this. I'm thinking 
about taking kind of a long shower or 
something. doing my homework.

209

I'm trying to think right now. 
I'm in a strange mood right now. 
I'm irritated about a few things.

210

I'm a little bit hungry right 
now, and I want to eat something. 
kind of. I want to eat something 
from the gas station. 

211

I feel like going out and doing 
something. Like real. I feel 
like going out on a road trip 
or something.

212

I don't know what kind of a day this is. 
Lazy. I'm feeling lazy. and that's pretty 
much it. I'm going to apply for a few more 
roles. but I don't know what to look for.

This most recent assignment was really cool. I had fun.

213

these are really
the most boring things 
that I can think of 
right now.

214

I'm trying to get my energy 
together to get myself to work 
on something, but, I'm just not 
there yet. I'm tired. I usually 
work from maybe 10 PM to early in 
the morning, last night I stopped 
after being kind of discouraged, 
and then, sort of 
figured out the issue.

215

I'm incredibly tired. I just came back 
from the museum, and I went out and did 
a bunch of other stuff as well, but 
nothing major, I just went out to eat. 
and that's it.

216

Today is my birthday. I booked a visit to 
the natural history museum. I actually wanted 
to go yesterday,  but for whatever reason it 
wasn't available. I wanted to go Sunday, but 
Sunday wasn't an option. maybe it's not open 
on Sunday? who knows. I really don't want to 
go anymore. I'm not really feeling okay. I'm 
experiencing quite a bit of anxiety about the 
future. I don't even want to go to the museum today.

217

I'm already tired compiling this massive poem.

It's impossible to get anything done 
during the day. for me anyway. I'm about 
to go to sleep. and I feel like my 
Monday is already gone. total nightmare.

Well. it turned out not to be too bad of a 
monday. I went into chinatown and ate a few 
sandwiches. but I am tired, and, most of the 
monday is gone.

221

Quite a bit of stress. There are a lot of things 
on my mind right now. This. is a nightmare. I guess 
that the only thing that I have to worry about is my 
class, my web development class, and, well, I don't 
know what else. Oh man what a total nightmare. I'm 
worried. What a disaster. What a nightmare. I'm super 
tired. I applied for something through LinkedIn. I want 
to go do something. Get out of the house, but I haven't 
gone anywhere more than a few blocks away from home. The 
gas station. The other gas station. The grocery store. 
Such a nightmare. Such a disaster. I'm in a lousy sort of 
garbage mood. I sent out a few resumes and applications 
through LinkedIn, and I've never done that before, so this 
is new. Life is a total nightmare for me right now. I feel 
so discouraged. I know that I should be thinking of things, 
these difficulties, whatever is going on right now, as an 
opportunity. but I'm really discouraged.

Monday and Tuesday are free for me. My birthday is coming 
up. I haven't done anything for my birthday in the longest 
time. It's just something I haven't celebrated in a while. 
I just can't stop thinking about how everything is a disaster 
right now. a total disaster. I'm really hoping this is all for 
the best. It's just that it might be a while before I'm at that 
point, where I can say this all happened for the best. When my 
nails are even just a few days long, when they've been growing 
for just a few days, or when I haven't cut them for a few days 
I find that it's hard, or, maybe just awkward, to type. It's 
hard. It's uncomfortable to type when I have just a few days 
of nail growth. Job search. nightmare. I'm worried about these 
next few months. I'm worried about these next few weeks. 
constantly anxious, and I can't really get my thoughts together.

222

I had quite a bit of fun with my most recent class 
assignment. I have to figure out what the requirements 
for the 3rd project, but I think that everything that 
is due tomorrow, all the homework assignments, are 
completed. I also have to get around to filing an appeal 
of my termination, and I have to think about where to apply 
and how to apply for work, and I have to prepare for some 
kind of thing regarding unemployment.

223

A nice clean laptop screen is now mine. It's nice. I like it. 
I can really see now. I'm really surprised with how good it looks. 
I rubbed it with rubbing alcohol, and it's really clean, and 
everything looks really visible. Years ago, when I moved to Missouri, 
I cleaned my computer with water, and it fucked things up, and I didn't 
really have money for a new computer for a while. I still get emails 
from coin companies, marketing emails to see if I want to buy anything, 
and, the answer is kind of yes, but for whatever reason, I think that 
silver coins are sometimes bad luck.

224

What did I work on today? well, the course has a kind of running project 
that I'm working on, and that's basically what I worked on today. Visually 
speaking, my fourth version of my project, Project 3-4, isn't very different 
from my third version of my project, Project 3-3, but for whatever reason it 
feels like I spent a lot of time doing the things that I did manage to do.

Visual Studio and GitHub. I have to set those two 
things up for my class and coursework. I'm so 
hungry right now. I need to get something to eat.

I went out to eat. I thought about heading to 
Chinatown and finding something to eat there, but, I'm 
just too tired. and at the time I was just too hungry. 
I'm so tired. I hung out last night. In retrospect I would 
have been better just staying home. Last night was a disaster.

Well, I have a real desk. This is nice. I'm trying 
to get all my thoughts together, finding focus. 
I like rolling over my 401k into my IRA. I don't 
like switching employers, but I like roll overs. 
It does give me more control and flexibility with 
things. I'm trying to think about worst case 
scenarios for the next few weeks to come, for the 
weeks and months ahead. One thing I don't want to think 
about are those times with things are worse than I thought 
they would be in a worst case scenario.

228

What do I do? I got an email from. you know. 
the company that fired me stating that I can 
request an appeal to my termination. I'm going 
to do it, but I have no idea how to approach the 
whole thing. This is a headache. I got my final 
checks from work, or, well, I saw that they were 
issued today, I didn't actually get them, in my 
bank account or anything. I've been spending too 
much money over the last few days, and my spending 
is something that I really have to take down to, you 
know, something lower than it currently is. It's hot, 
I'm always sweating and I always feel somewhat greasy.

229

There are a few things in life that are just a little 
bit too strange. Like what? well, I applied for unemployment 
here in Nevada and I see that the last person I contacted 
for work was. someone. not here in Las Vegas, maybe a while 
ago, but not any more. or maybe. I wouldn't really know. 
I've tried to stay away from that part of town. I don't 
know what to do about the job search. I want to try using 
LinkedIn to look for work. I don't want to do anything too 
physically demanding if I can avoid it. How to stay in shape? 
I don't really know, I was getting fat anyway.

234

Going on a road trip is kind of on my mind right now. but it's not really a 
good idea when I think about it. I just got canned. I should be looking for 
work. but what kind of work should I be looking for?

235

Totally got canned today. by email. and in this case the nightmare is over, 
because the nightmare already just happened. there's like, impending doom, the 
moment of doom, and what happens after the moment of doom, and that's where 
I'm at right now: post-doom. I don't know what to do. This is a disaster. 
Total nightmare. I have no idea about what to do. I worked on one of the other 
assignments for my programming class, and it looks really cool. I don't know 
what to do work-wise.

236

This last assignment for my software and web development course was 
just too fun. It took me forever, but I was able to get everything 
working, and I think the iframes below should work. I'm really dreading 
going back to work, and I'm also really dreading the idea that my last 
day at work is just around the corner.

237

I have no idea what kind of position to be looking for. I really 
want to take a nap right now. I don't know what's going to happen 
as far as work goes. I have to remember that this could be an opportunity 
to do something new, and, that's something I should look forward to. 
I don't have a resume. I haven't been to an interview in forever. I don't 
know where to begin. This is a nightmare. I was able to track down some 
old files on an older laptop that I have. I don't know why this older laptop 
is so slow, I bought it last year, but from the very beginning it just didn't 
work very quickly. Moving the files took about an hour, and I want to say that 
the total number of files was around 20,000 at maybe 200 GB, and I really don't 
think that's a lot of stuff to move, it was just from my computers internal storage 
to an external storage device. an hour. really.

238

I am already tired of compiling this document
or putting together this massive, epic poem of mine!
tired really tired.

239

Not really feeling all that fabulous. I've been using 
some of the dating apps again, but, being on those things 
makes me unhappy more often than it makes me happy. They 
depress me more than they elevate my mood in any way. This 
dating app stuff really makes me unhappy, and maybe that's 
the whole idea. I don't want to do it, I want to get off 
these dating apps, and I think that I will.

Working and and reworking some of my course projects 
turned out to be very enjoyable. I think that I took 
it in one direction, and then wanted to go back and 
take it in a slightly different direction. I want to 
continue to try a few things, but we are already moving 
on to new things, and I still want to play around with 
it. I think that if I started on it sooner, than I could 
have spent more time playing around with it, but I more 
or less just started on it this morning.

There are 3 copyright registrations pending, 
and 1 trademark registration pending for 
Chestnut + Hazel. This should be kind of cool. 
I'm really unhappy about all the dating app 
stuff. I really want to delete these things. 
I'm not happy with them. I don't know what to 
do with them, mothball them maybe. I'm really 
not feeling well, at all, everything is just a 
total nightmare. dread. everything. is not going 
well. I don't know what on earth to do about work. 
My inclination is to wait until I'm canned before 
I do any job search kind of stuff. My suspension 
ends on August 8th, and at that point I'll know if 
I'm going to get canned, or if I'm going to go back 
to work. I haven't done well in the 8 or whatever 
weeks I've been at this new location.

and it's not like starting today with any job search 
is really going to give me any kind of advantage. 3 
or 4 days or whatever is not a huge head start.

240

So Chestnut + Hazel officially has a trademark 
pending. It might be a year before I hear anything 
back from the US PTO. There are also a few copyright 
registrations that I have pending, and in my 
experience, those could take about four months to process.

With all the other stuff I have going on, the disasters, 
the impending disasters. I'm going to dig into my homework 
that's due tomorrow, and see where that goes. there are so 
many things going on, so many things going wrong that I 
really don't know where to begin. So close. I had these 
credit cards on the way to zero, and now this. I'm frozen 
right now, not in the sense that I'm immobile, or stuck 
in place, but I have things to do that I just haven't 
done yet. so. I'm just here.

So I'm working on one of my class projects, and it was 
pretty interesting. I spent too much time on this last 
thing, working with padding, margins, and borders. I 
integrated the new concepts into a previous project, 
and created and messed around with some of the buttons 
that I created.

241

This chair that I'm sitting on 
right now is falling apart 
structurally.

242

What a mood I'm in! I don't 
really feel all that great 
right now. I did laundry, I 
cleaned my card. I registered 
a copyright and a trademark, 
or, it has to be awarded, so I 
guess I submitted the applications 
for registration. I'm worried about 
the prospect of getting canned from 
work. Getting canned is something 
that I should take as an opportunity, 
to do something else, to try something 
new, but it's not something I'm really 
prepared for. Credit Card wise, I'd be 
back in minimum payment mode. I was so 
close, and now it all falls apart again. 
I need to finish my homework for class. 
The thing is. I have no idea what to 
do about class if I have to start 
looking for work again, because, I 
prefer working nights, but it isn't 
clear to me what else is out there working 
nights.

243

Years ago, like a decade ago really, like ten years ago or more, 
I remember wanting to work at a casino, but I never did it, this 
was when I was living in San Jose, CA, and there were a number of 
card houses in the area, and, I think at the time a new card house 
completed construction. I don't really go into casinos, I don't really 
gamble, and so I don't really no much about them. Last year when I went 
on my road trips from Texas to Michigan I came across tons of casinos, 
it's really surprising how many there are, there's not the concentration 
of casinos out there like there are here in Las Vegas, NV, but they are 
out there, and you see them every so often.

244

This is kind of a headache. I think that I bit off more than I can chew.
I don't know what other things to put into this Epic Adventure Poem of mine.

245

There was one in Michigan, I think, somewhere close to Battle Creek, MI 
that I stopped at and checked out, mostly for the restaurants, I stayed 
at the less expensive motel across the street. I played a few games of 
some kind of card game, but, I don't remember what it was called, or what 
it was or what the rules were, I just chatted with the card dealer and 
kind of got a feeling of what the role is like.

246

This is a little bit of a nightmare. I can't really think right now. 
There are so many things on my mind right now that I'm worried about, 
and my thoughts skip from one thing to another. I want to finish my 
coursework today, but I also need to finish my course work today.

247

So it's kind of back to square one, I'm kind of back to the drawing 
board on the Chestnut and Hazel logo or trademark. Some of the newer 
things that I've tried don't really succeed as a favicon, and that really 
plays into it. The success or the failure of the design of the trademark 
logo hinges upon whether or not it looks nice as a favicon, and there 
really isn't much to work with when it comes to a favicon. I'm working 
on this design pixel by pixel, by hand, and part of the reason I'm doing 
this is to make sure that I can obtain a copyright, and eventually a trademark.

out, mostly for the restaurants, I stayed at the less expensive motel across the street. I played a 
few games of some kind of card game, but, I don't remember what it was called, or what it was or what 
the rules were, I just chatted with the card dealer and kind of got a feeling of what the role is like.

251

This is a little bit of a nightmare. I can't really think right 
now. There are so many things on my mind right now that I'm 
worried about, and my thoughts skip from one thing to another. 
I want to finish my coursework today, but I also need to finish 
my course work today.

252

So it's kind of back to square one, I'm kind of back to the drawing 
board on the Chestnut and Hazel logo or trademark. Some of the newer 
things that I've tried don't really succeed as a favicon, and that 
really plays into it. The success or the failure of the design of the 
trademark logo hinges upon whether or not it looks nice as a favicon, 
and there really isn't much to work with when it comes to a favicon. 
I'm working on this design pixel by pixel, by hand, and part of the 
reason I'm doing this is to make sure that I can obtain a copyright, 
and eventually a trademark.

48 Logos and Logo Elements for Chestnut + Hazel

Updating titles to some of my blog posts, mostly just 
taking posts that are Archived Content posts and shoving 
them into the nearest series of posts, Reflections from 
Chestnut Street or Letters from Sanford Street or whatever. 
There is the issue of work. I was at two write-ups, and now 
I'm on suspension. I don't know what on earth to do, even if, 
somehow, I end up keeping my position, there is still the issue 
of things not really becoming easier at work. Things just 
haven't become easier.

255

Around 2 PM yesterday I stopped at a motel about 100 miles 
outside of Las Vegas and stopped to rest. It's 3 AM right now. 
I thought about heading home early but there's no key drop off 
so I guess I'll finish out my stay. I missed 2 days of work, 
this isn't the end of the world, but it's definitely sub-optimal. 
I wanted to see the Utah Natural History Museum, but I couldn't 
figure out how to get tickets from their website, and 3rd party 
websites didn't offer them either. Plus, it wasn't open at 6 AM or 
whatever, so I headed back home because I was really in a shitty mood. 
I did consider continuing on to Boise, Idaho, thinking that I might 
still be able to go in to work, well, I didn't make it. I might try 
this again, but who knows.

256

Maybe I'll just say it the way it is. 
I'm feeling unbelievably depressed. 
Like real bad. An unshakable melancholy 
that won't go the fuck away. I'm really 
glad I did this because as soon as I get 
back to Las Vegas I'm setting up a doctor's 
appointment. There's no reason for me to feel 
this unhappy. None. 

But right now, I don't really know what 
to do. I really want to take. Nap but 
check in isn't until 230. I could be back 
in Vegas by that time.

I'm so unhappy. 
It comes out of nowhere. 
I don't know what the fuck causes it. 

It has to be some kind of chemical imbalance. 
If I have no reason to feel sad, 
and feel sad out of nowhere, 
then there's really no other fucking explanation.

Anyway. Salt Lake City is kind of nice, 
between Provo and Salt Lake City there's a 
town that really felt like Overland Park, Kansas.

That was quick. my phone is now covered in cracks, and it looks like a spider web.

The Best Haircut (2023)

Hello Earth! Moon! Mars! & Venus!
What I thought was a haircut turned out
not to be a haircut. it was. actually.
just. hair.

hiding behind the neck.
hair hides behind the neck
and plays

hide and seek.
or maybe
MARCO ! POLO !
no hair is the same as hairless
no hare is a tortoise.
FASTER! slower. FASTER! FASTER! FASTER!

Harder? like the shell of a tortoise?
NO! just FASTER!
My home
is on Audrey Hepburn Street!

where else could I possibly live?

Things I like about my home
foremost among those things I like about my home

is that Audrey Hepburn is always here

and in the neighborhood I like that we have

places Audrey Hepburn likes to eat
places Audrey Hepburn likes to go
places Audrey Hepburn likes to see

The Best Haircut (2023) by Kenneth Larot Yamat dba Chestnut + Hazel
"The Best Haircut" is actually a poem about Marianne Shaffer

Letters to Katastrophiena # 6
Publication Date 07/21/2023

I really would like to file a copyright for just 
that one poem, rather than having it ride inside The Epic Adventures
of Chestnut + Hazel.

I'm trying to think. I have class until noon today, then I go into 
work at 6 pm, or slightly after. there is really no time for me to 
do anything until the weekend. or, well, my weekend, which is in 
the middle of the week.

kenneth

what?

what are you working on?

i'm not working on anything. 
i know that i should be working on 
something, but, i'm goofing off. 
well. i'm working on my blog. so 
i am. actually. working on something.

are you doing anything next week?
i'm thinking about the salt lake city thing again.
i'm not sure if it's as exciting as you imagine it to be.
so?

if you're trying to enjoy yourself, you should 
aim to have the most fun with the least effort.

263

i thought
that it was
entertaining that
you were
in time
for cornflakes

i never really
thought you
liked cornflakes

i thought that
you were more

"The Best Stuff is not Stuffing" (2023)

The Best Stuff is not Stuffing
The best things that are for thanksgiving

could be called green bean casserole and
candied yams,
but not stuffing
you see, stuffing is a verb

and not a noun
and therefore not a thing
and therefore cannot be among the best things
because stuffing is a verb and it is not a noun

and therefore not a thing
and as a consequence cannot be among the best things

265

when those things are 
changed and transformed into
the new things that
have been or where
or what
have you been
when the test of the
multiple choices

266

hear the things
that have been said
before
and here 
are the things that are
written on the back of
where you were when you had been the best

267

how are the best things
that you can think of being
used to be the best of the things
that you think are the less of the 
comparison

and that's what the things
you think of as being the best
of the least common
aspects of things you hear
when you taste the
you know what.

268

Lately I haven't felt the really deep sadness 
that I've been struggling with for quite a 
few months, but right now I feel like it can 
head in that direction.

269

One of the pairs of jeans that I bought is 
just plain white. They were already dirty by 
the time I got home and put them on, but they 
are very comfortable for some reason. I think 
that dyes can change how cotton fabrics feel, 
I'm not sure if there is a difference when it 
comes to synthetic fabrics.

Yeah, these jeans are really comfortable. 
I'm really surprised with how comfortable they are.

270

I bought two pairs of jeans, two pairs of 
pants. three shirts, two of which have 
shirt pockets, and two pairs of shoes.

271

I bought a shirt. It's kind of small. 
well. Actually. It is small, but it's 
smaller than I thought it would be.

272

Kenneth. write this down. Forget about salt 
lake city temporarily. Stay local for now. do 
some in-person shopping to get out and explore.

273

Lately I haven't felt the really deep sadness 
that I've been struggling with for quite a few 
months, but right now I feel like it can head 
in that direction.

274

Kenneth
what
did you notice anything today
yeah
what did you notice?
tabasco sauce.

and where is tabasco sauce made?
i'm not going to answer that.
yes you are

louisiana
remember that.

anyway. I usually eat my burritos with sweet and sour sauce.
yeah, that bothers me.
why do you care?
i don't.

275

Right now I'm not feeling unhappy, 
or angry, or manic, or anxious, or 
worried. I'm kind of centered right 
now and this is kind of nice.

276

I've been up for about 2 hours, or 
what feels like 2 hours, it's actually 
only been an hour and a half, but it feels 
like I haven't done anything. I tidied up, 
and took a shower and did some grooming and 
laundry, these don't always feel like real 
accomplishments, but they are things that 
need to be done, and I honestly want to spend 
more time, I want to dedicate more time to 
looking good. or at least looking like I actually 
put in time to. look more or less. I think I 
want to look like I put some thought into it, 
and I put some effort into it, but not in a way 
that's extremely high-maintenance or anything and 
in a way that's clearly not high-maintenance.

277

Maybe to put it another way. I want to look 
very nice in a way that is very efficient and 
also looks very efficient. One issue I'm having 
right now is actually. Pants.

278

I really want to file 
a patent for some kind of 
useful software program.

I'm failing MIS 768
and I'm trying to salvage whatever 
time I've spent and whatever money 
I've spent to take the course. 

There isn't an absolution clause in 
the MIS 768 syllabus that states:
"All your academic sins are washed away 
when you file a patent during the course of 
this class."

when I say that I'm trying to salvage the situation 
what I mean is. Getting a good grade, like an A in 
the course would be an asset, but obtaining a patent 
after creating something useful from the knowlege I'd 
obtained while taking the course would create an actual 
asset.

I good grade is an asset in a figurative sense

280

So many emails and I'm 
really nobody notable.

Anyway, pants. I kind of want to 
have a 2 week supply of pants, but 
I'm not sure I really need that many. 
It's just that some times. I don't 
really need 14 pairs of pants, It's 
just sometimes I don't always have 
the time to do laundry every week.

281

I guess what I want in a pair of pants 
is a shorter inseam and more of a taper, 
without it being a slim fit. The length 
of the inseam isn't something I worried 
about when I wore boots, but I don't really 
wear boots that much anymore so the inseam matters.

282

It's midnight, lunchtime, and I feel kind of unhappy. 
There is a brick inside my chest. A stack of bricks. I 
don't know what causes this. It oscillates. My mood 
oscillates from irritated to unhappy. Over and over. Sad 
to grouchy and grouchy to sad and over and over and I have 
no idea why.

287

To the Divine One who
holds dominion over
all those things
that can and usually do go wrong 
for me

yesterday was agonizing
and
i'm sure there's a time 
and place
and purpose 
for everything

i'm sure there are times when it's
appropriate to torture
kenneth

but i'm also sure there's an
appropriate time
to show kenneth mercy

things have been more or less downhill since february of 2022, and, 
maybe things have become a little bit better since i left texas and 
came back to nevada, but it has been at kind of a snail's pace and i 
honestly consider this a form of torture. i think. that. the time for 
delivering mercy. unto kenneth. is at hand. divine one.

anyway. i registered the domain katastrophiena.com and um, i think i'll 
finally get around to registering a few trademarks.

I didn't get much sleep this morning. I was busy 
setting up the new domain and emails for it and 
doing a little writing that I found that it was 
noon before I even got a chance to lay down and 
rest. So I'm at six hours of sleep for the day 
which is a lot less than usual but I'll see how 
this goes.

The fact that I had so many energy drinks the day 
before may have also played into it as well. It's 
hot. Really hot, and it's hot enough that the AC in 
my car accomplishes almost nothing when it's running. 
I don't remember it being this hot the last time I was 
in Vegas five years ago.

No ideas but inside

and there are shells of new ideas 
and there are no ideas but inside 
things called brains and there are no 
images except in a PNG format and
she was not wearing any panties and 
for one reason or another I did not 
make a move on her.

293

This is the way it goes. and this 
is the way it will always be.
and this is the wonder that's keeping 
your thighs apart: I carry your panties.
I carry them in my left pocket!

294

Anyway, I'm blank right now. I can't 
really think about. I can't really 
figure out what to do. I don't really 
know what I would do in the event that 
I had to, or would have to look for a 
new job. I really don't. I don't really 
even have a resume. I think. I haven't 
really been motivated to look for anything 
new, and I haven't really been interested 
in looking for anything new.

295

Before I left Arlington I applied for and 
received an offer for an outside sales role. 
I don't know if it's still referred to as 
outside sales. I didn't take it because it 
would have. I wouldn't have been able to go 
to college and work. The scheduling wouldn't 
work. That one incomplete semester set me back 
ten thousand bucks, and, in retrospect I probably 
should have taken the job. I remember seeing their 
headquarters building in Nashville during that first 
road trip through the Midwest. I can't really do 
anything this year. I'm so damn far behind.

Yeah, I don't really know what I would 
do if I had to start looking for work again. 
I did take a look the other day, but, I didn't 
send out any applications, and, no resumes since 
I don't have one. There was one opening that 
really caught my eye, but I kind of just want to 
stay where I'm at and see what develops. If I 
were to get canned I'll just take it as an 
opportunity to try something new.

296

I'm trying to figure out where to start. 
I'm thinking that I should look at a number 
of positions, and seeing what qualifications 
are required, and then seeing what kind of 
educational or technical or vocational 
training I need. I'm really kind of averse 
to working during the day.

297

This is the last day of the work week. 
That went really fast. It usually doesn't 
go by that fast. I did sign up for 
overtime this week. A half shift in the 
middle of my weekend, and that's both a 
good thing and a not-so-good thing. It has 
positives and negatives. On the one hand it 
breaks my weekend, but on the other, it doesn't 
lengthen my workweek the way it would if it were 
at the beginning or at the end of my workweek.

I've been thinking about going somewhere, 
not anywhere too far, but I'm not really 
sure if I should or not.

298

i imagined you called me
and asked me to coffee
i imagined zero things i'd rather do

I went to the buffet yesterday. 
I got a fortune cookie and I feel 
like fortune cookies are my, secondary 
of course, but almost a second primary 
reason for going to the buffet. I was 
disappointed with what it said because 
it didn't feel like it really meant 
anything to me. it said something like: 
an optimistic heart clears the path to 
victory. and I'm not even sure how that's 
relevant to me.

My work week isn't that long. 
I work four days a week. nights.

My work
week isn't
that
long.

302

here you are again. I see you.
you are looking at me, but guess what!
I AM ALSO LOOKING AT YOU!

303

It's the last work 
day of the week.

These Facebook memories feel 
weird to look at. Fort Smith, 
Arkansas; Azle, Texas; Beaverlick, 
Kentucky; Holladay, Tennessee; Cameron 
Missouri; Sunnyvale, California.

It's weird because maybe life really 
does happen in cycles. I thought 
about taking a road trip the 
other day, not because I 
wanted to, but out of 
frustration, to kind 
of blow off steam.

I realized that I 
really don't go anywhere 
or even get out of the house 
unless I'm frustrated with something.

305

Well, 
I put it all in an index fund, 
and, 
I'm just going to leave it where it is.

306

I don't think I created a good 
faith violation with my IRA, but 
I'm not really when I'll know for 
sure. Well, two days from now I guess. 
I'm going to day trade tomorrow, but 
I'm going to take it slow, play it safe, 
and not let my emotions get the better of me.

307

not sure but there 
are more spiders than there are 
insects in the mouths 
of birds that fly 
around and eat spiders 
and other insects. it's true!

I'm thinking about what 
to do about my IRA, like, 
I'm thinking about what I 
should do next. Now that 
I've closed out my position 
in VFC, I can really do 
something else. I'm not here 
trying to grind my way into a 
profit, or, out of a loss or 
whatever. I'm irritated because 
I spent so much time trying to 
make it work, and now it's just over.

308

On the one hand I'm thinking that 
maybe this is the point where it 
would have turned around, and I 
could have existed without a loss, 
or, even have made some money, on 
the other hand, VFC could just as 
easily have dropped to 8.00 a share, 
in fact, I think I was strategizing 
on how to deal with that exact situation, 
but, then it started turning around.

What did the fortune cookie say?

"The universe is aligning 
to bring you a soulmate connection."

and I'm just thinking: 
yeah, sure it is.

When I think about how that all 
turned out, like, I would have 
been better off just getting a 
second job or something, but that 
wouldn't work either because I'm 
really just too tired to work two jobs.

309

I've cleaned 
up my car quite a 
bit, but I still 
have quite a bit of 
stuff in there that 
I don't know what to do 
with, or that I haven't 
made a decision on how to 
deal with. I had shoes and 
clothes in there that I hadn't 
taken out for months.

Can you send pictures of whatever
it is you are looking at because I can't 
quite picture in my head the exact thing
that you are describing to me.

313

So after cleaning up all of the posts that were flagged, 
I got another notice that the issue has been flagged again, 
and so I have to spend time looking through my blog again 
and figure out where all the offending posts are.  

This is somewhat difficult given that there are so many 
posts for me to look through.

314

So it's everything after the Letters from Sanford Street 
that I can add to this Epic Poem of the Epic Adventures of 
Chestnut + Hazel.

315

Here are the best of the
worst of the last of the 
newest and the most recent
of the latest and the greatest
and the most trending stuff

and if you slay when you
get things done or maybe things
you try to do fall flat or
maybe you slay when you fail
or maybe you do well or maybe
you

don't do what you think about
doing when the best of the
orange juice turns into a horse
the size of a tangerine.

316

I think that everything 
with my blog has been taken 
care of in terms of content 
decency or content restrictions, 
and so I guess I was able to put 
the ads back on my blog. I finally 
finished it. It wasn't that hard or 
anything. I don't know why I didn't 
finish it for several months. The ads 
have been of since March 16th, and it's 
May 16th. There were several posts that 
I had to fix, and I think that I was 
debating between just making minor 
edits to each post, or just making 
entirely new posts.

They went to the store
and they bought a bag
of fruits and with the fruits
they made a bunch of different
drinks depending on what kind
of fruits they had

if they had oranges they
would make orange juice
and if they had grapes
they would make grape juice.

317

and I have to ask if you 
knew who the people were
who changed the fruits into

different kinds of drinks
if they knew that grapes
could become grape juice

and pomegranates could
become
pomegranate juice

did they
know or
did they
not know

318

These are where
the oranges are turned
into the paste 

and the pulp
becomes part of the orange
juice 

and the lemonade 

and
the fruit punch makes
things and drinks that you
can enjoy.

These are the drinks that
are enjoyable to drink.

Project Proposal:				

To create a program that automatically creates
trading tickets for a security, for example, buy 
and sell orders for shares of an exchange traded fund.

A user would only manually enter the first order, either to 
buy or sell a security, the program would populate and submit 
a new ticket based on the fulfillment of the previous ticket, 
the chain of tickets would continue until the user decided to
cancel the chain.

Another application of this program would be to serve as a
treasury management solution.

320

There's a Little Caesars Pizza close to where I live. 
I went there a few times to get pizza, and I want to 
say that the last two times I went there, nothing was 
Hot-N-Ready, so I would go to the grocery store, or 
7-11, or something, I don't remember exactly; I clearly 
didn't starve to death. Anyway, I went again today, and, 
not wanting to leave empty-handed, I decided to place my 
order through the Little Caesars app first, and then head 
over there, and it worked. There's the option to pay through 
the app, and the option to pay in person, and there is also a 
guest check out, that way I didn't have to set up an account 
or anything. I really wasn't in the mood to set up an account, 
or enter my credit card information into the app or whatever. 
I ordered a nicer pizza that I would ordinarily buy from 
Little Caesars.

321

What Was Originally Here?

I don't remember what was originally here
but whatever it was, I guess it must have been
interesting. There were a lot of pictures and
screenshots of this or that. I don't know what
to do with all of these photographs I'm amassing.

I took of all of the photographs, and saved them.
but I don't know what to do eventually. Where
to put them or post them.

322

Background and the needs:
		
This program is needed because there are many securities
that are difficult to trade because they are illiquid as
a result of large bid and ask spreads, or because they lack 
volume. 

The goal is to reduce spreads while increasing volume.

Another need is due to the fact that manually performing this task
is laborious and prone to error.

323

but i don't really know if i really want to deal with ONEQ. 
There is really a whole lot of bull shit on a lot of these total 
market index funds, and i really don't want to deal with a lot of them. 
stupid. stupid. I know. there's just a lot of shitty ones on the index. 
zombie ticker symbols on the index. some of them never fall off the 
index. well. i don't know. a lot of them are garbage.

I did manage to take care of a few things with my old. With my 401(k). 
and that was kind of nice. I don't know. what else to do. there were a 
few student loan, student aid, and student grant related stuff for school. 
I don't recall. exactly what the deadline is for the application period. 
I want to say that it is.

I guess my day was okay, I did a bunch of 
stuff on the las vegas strip today, but at 
some point i had trouble finding where I parked my car.

326

If there is no overtime this week 
I kind of want to do something. I don't 
know what, but I want to do something. but 
then again. I also kind of don't want to do 
anything. I don't really know. I think about 
things that I want to do. Things that I enjoy 
doing. and sometimes I'm not really sure that 
there are any. I have this idea for a road-trip, 
and it's basically Las Vegas to Carson City to 
Salt Lake City and back.

It's the same distance as the Louisiana Road Trip 
I took back in 2022, and I remember what a disaster 
that turned out to be, but I went on a whole bunch 
since then and they just weren't as much of a disaster, 
so. I'm kind of one-way-or-another. I don't really know.

Question Number One:

Do I really want to go on a long ass drive?

Question Number Two:

Do I really want to stay in bed all weekend?

I just don't have the same kind of stamina and endurance 
I had just a few years ago. I really don't. and I really 
don't want to take any huge risks. at the same time, I'm 
just kind of not in any kind of good mood. I don't know if 
going on a long drive will alleviate that or anything.

Think about how you
on the basis of your 
skills and your mastery
of the nonsense of being
the best of the greatest people
in the entire universe

think about how you
on the edge of the universe
how you
on the fringe of the tablecloth

and waste the best of all your
orange juice reserves

the orange juice
is very special

the orange juice
is also
old
and pale

think about the best of the taste of all
the orange juice and how

each one of your balls
is the size
of a tangerine.

329

is either of your 
testicles
individually 

the size 
of a tangerine?
or is your ballsack
when taken together 
as a whole

a ball sack the size 
of a 
tangerine?

I saw one guy kicking 
the other guy 
in a ballsack the size 
of a tangerine.

the size

I slept for something like 3 hours and 
I feel fully rechanged. This is really weird. 
Usually I'm dead tired even if I stay asleep 
an hour before I start work, and that's 
usually a hell of a lot of hours of sleep.

333

Trying new things. Well, I want to buy a new 
computer game, but none of the ones I'm looking 
at are games that I'm familiar with, and I'm not 
even really sure that I'll enjoy them. Why or why 
would it not matter? Who knows.

334

I've decided not to go on any kind 
of road trip this week. There isn't 
any overtime, but there are other 
things that I can keep myself occupied 
with for these next few days off.

Well, I guess I spoke too soon, 
there was a short extra shift 
available. So I signed up for it.

335

I was up most of the day. I went to 
get pizza. I played Civilization 6. 
I really only play Civilization 6 as 
Phillip the Second of Spain. I left 
work early yesterday. I capped out on 
Paid Time Off, but for how long? I have 
no idea. I hope I didn't cap out for the 
year. The allocation is about 2 hours per 
week, so it's been about 40 hours I've 
used, and that sounds about right, but 
I'm surprised that I've used it all already.

336

I don't take very many pictures. 
I haven't taken very many pictures 
ever, but I guess I just haven't been 
anywhere new, or, maybe I just haven't 
thought to take any pictures of anything 
I've seen recently. The photo upload 
quality on Blogger is kind of garbage.

337

I left work early twice this week. One day I took VTO, 
and the other day I took PTO. I went to a buffet in 
Chinatown, and I ate only about 2 or 3 plates of food, and then left.

I've been feeling kind of discouraged about how much 
progress I've made paying down my credit cards, 
because I haven't really made any progress paying 
down my credit cards, but then I remembered that it's 
only been two weeks since April, so I've only been at 
it for two weeks.

338

The other day the dogs 
took my athletes foot cream, 
and I think they took it again today.

339

After setting up my phone fully, 
it seems to be working better than 
it had. This new phone seems to work 
better than my previous phone. The 
connection seems to be better than 
it was earlier, so I guess it's not 
that bad, maybe the only issue was 
setting it up.

340

How can a person have athlete's food, and. 
well, sometimes a person develops athelet's balls.
and the balls 
are in a sack 
that's the size 
of a tangerine!

I have a new phone, my old phone cracked and I've gotten 
around to replacing it. I haven't changed service providers. 
It's horrible. I can barely connect my phone to anything. 
The connection is terrible. I don't know what the hell to 
do. Absolutely horrible.

343

A while ago I was donating 
stuff to the thrift store in 
an effort to get rid of anything 
that I didn't really need, or at 
least, get rid of anything I didn't 
think that I would need, and I think 
I donated a set of unopened wood-chisels. 
I didn't really need them because I really 
didn't think that I would take up wood-working 
or anything, and I'm not taking up 
wood-working or anything, but I recently 
came across a use for them, and when I 
looked for them, I couldn't find them, and 
realized that I had donated them a while back. 
I was going to use the wood-chisels to shape the 
tree in the yard. Nothing major, just chip away 
at some of the knobbing that develops when stray 
branches are removed.

I got rid of most of the stray 
branches with a hatchet, a throwing 
axe, and I bashed some of the knobs 
on the tree using a hammer.

This is where the
lucky ones and the
unlucky ones 

eat the oranges and
place the best of the worst

and the pomegranates
are opened up and

you like persimmons but
in my opinion, persimmons really aren't

all that great.

345

I stil don't have the slightest clue what.
That's the thing. I have no idea what I
was searching for. There was something
that I wanted to see if I forgot or not, but
I have no idea what it was or what it is that
I should be looking for.

I put in an order for a new phone,
and
I'm in the process of deleting my OKCupid account.

the issue is that the delete button doesn't work.
and so
I'm not able to delete it.

347

There's something that I think I 
should take care of, but I have no 
idea what it is. I don't know what 
it is. I'm sure it will come to me later, 
but I have no idea what it is, there's 
just something that I think I'm forgetting 
right now.

349

I got rid of a pile of coins, 
loose change, at the grocery store 
earlier today, I think it turned out 
to be about one dollar and fifty cents 
or so. I have work later today. This 
week I signed up for a few extra shifts, 
but there were only half-shifts available, 
and I'm kind of happy about that. I just 
haven't had a ton of energy for full-length 
extra-shifts. Even though, obviously, it's 
better to have a whole shifts pay rather 
than just a half-shifts pay, I'm not too 
sure how much I'm worried about all of that right now.

350

these are a few of the things that I like the best 
and when they are always with the next 
of the best of the worst of the nearest 
and when they come over to the end of the 
chickens feet are cooked in a box.

351

I don't really 
have much to write 
about these days.

I've been meaning to 
re-monetize my blog, 
and I did a little work 
on that, but, there is a 
lot of reviewing and stuff 
that I have to do. Most of 
the time I just erase 
whatever was there before, 
post it somewhere else, 
and then write something 
new where the old post was.

I don't really make a whole lot of 
money blogging, so it's not critically 
important that I re-monetize. The main 
issue is just making everything look 
more professional.

352

These are the things that you are thinking about
when you were sitting on the toilet
and then remembered later when you
were hanging out at the urinal.

you can make thing easier for
yourself or you could potentially
make things more difficult and
listen to what you've been doing.

I want to see things escalate in a way
that is more interesting than the way
they've currently been. I haven't

been very motivated and I think that
things are just more or less useless as
they have ever been.

it's not that my life has been uneventful
because my life is usually uneventful
I just don't really have anything to write
about. everything

seems to be a repetition of things that
have happened before, and documenting
the present is often just a reiteration of

what has happened in the past. things that
are happening now are just things that
have happened before, and are happening
again.

in so many ways i just haven't been 
particularly motivated

in so many ways i've just lost interest
in so many things.

i've been losing motivating
and i've
been losing interest.

I've been experiencing an 
elevated level of stress. 
I don't know what it is. The 
whole time I've been in Las Vegas 
I've been experiencing stress and 
fatigue. I really don't know what's 
causing this. I've tried to make changes 
like drinking more water, and I've noticed 
a slight improvement, but, a very very 
slight improvement. I've been drinking 
slightly less soda, but still quite a bit of it. 
I don't know what else to do.

355

As far as taking any road-trips goes, 
I haven't really planned anything or 
made any definite commitments to go on 
one. I just have that idea of a road-trip 
to Carson City then Salt Lake City and 
then back to Las Vegas.

357

I did a minimal amount of 
working on my blog today. 
I changed a few of the titles 
on the Sanford Street series, 
just a few posts where the 
title was [NUMBER] Sanford Street 
to Letters from Sanford Street # [NUMBER]. I've 
been meaning to do all of them, but it honestly 
really doesn't matter. It doesn't look like ads are 
completely removed from my blog, it just looks like 
they are limited in some way, but it isn't clear to 
me how they are restricted. It's strange that my blog 
is flagged for being adult content because most of this 
is all text. It's not like I have pornographic videos and 
pictures on here.

and then we thought that we would 
see eachother again but we never did 
or at least. it was me who never saw you again.

359

One thing that created a bit of anxiety 
for me was the Chase Checking Account glitch 
where payments were being processed twice.

I actually didn't 
notice the issue at first.

When payday hit, I saw that my 
checking account balance went up, 
but not as much as I expected, 
especially considering how much 
overtime I worked that week. I 
figured that I had a bunch of 
outgoing payments and transfers 
since I usually schedule outgoing 
payments or transfers on a payday, 
and that it was simply due to that, 
and I really didn't look into it any further.

The other reason no alarm bells went off in my 
mind is because the transaction that was 
processed twice was approximately the same 
amount as a few transfers and payments that 
I was sure were going to process around that 
time that I made, so I really just thought 
that it was the payments and transfers that I made.

I was nevertheless stressed out because I started 
to feel that maybe I didn't really plan correctly. 
or something. Anyway, I saw a prompt by Chase about 
the double transaction glitch, and, what do you know, 
it turns out that I was a victim of the Chase Double 
Payment Processing glitch.

when we met 
we said to eachother

My main short term goal is to 
get my credit cards paid off before 
the end of August. This has been my 
goal since the beginning of the year, 
and I think it's a realistic goal. The 
end of August is when my student loan 
repayments start, and I don't want to 
be crushed by student loans and credit 
cards at the same time.

Well, I wonder if someone 
is helping me out here, but, 
who knows. I want to say 
someone is obviously helping 
me out, because something 
kind of funny just happened.

365

I want to write something 
here, but I'm not sure what 
to write, and it's not for a 
lack of things to write, it's 
just that I have no idea what 
I should write about, 
considering the number of 
things that I could write about.

367

I know that it's just cookies, but they don't know that. 
you know. it could have been anything. it could have been 
anything it really could have.

I don't really have very many opportunities 
to write down what's going on, or how things 
have been. There's just other stuff I've been 
doing. I've been playing computer games and 
stuff. tangerine

I have to set aside time to re-monetize my 
blog and get the ads back up, they've been 
taken down due to some obscenity related 
complaints, but I just haven't gotten around 
to remedying the issue.

368

I still have to finish cleaning up 
my blog. There was a signup for overtime 
that came through, but I missed it by two 
hours. This has happened a few times, but, 
I guess it's not as important as it used to 
be. I mean, I guess I don't need the overtime 
money as much as I used to. Well, that's not 
really true. I always need the overtime 
money as long as I have bills to pay.

369

I haven't had a phone break in a while, 
but a few hours ago I dropped my phone 
and the screen cracked. This is a headache.

and cleaning things out

i want to upload some pictures
and upload some old text files
too

i think the bulk of what i
have there on my Google Drive
are music files i saved
when deleting everything
on my computer

i uploaded all of my
stuff and wiped my drive
clean

I got a minimum amount of 
stuff done during the week. 
I almost want to say I got 
nothing done during the week. 
I don't know. I just didn't get 
much done. I played on the computer. 
I dealt with some money orders that 
I've had sitting around, and I did a 
few things with my investments. Well,
my retirement investments anyway. I don't 
have any non-retirement money right now. I 
have to get started on my taxes, and I have 
to go donate things to the thrift store. 
I'll do that next week. 

375

right now I am very tired and I don't 
think that anything will get any better 
and things will only get more amazing. 
things will turn around for me in a major 
way and things will get better and everything 
will work out and I will thrive and I will do well. 
and I will be happy with myself. and I will be pleased 
by what I accomplished.

376

Something interesting came in the mail today; it was 
marketing mail for business checking accounts from 
Citibank and US Bank, and they were addressed to Chestnut & Hazel. 
I wouldn't mind setting up business checking accounts for Chestnut + Hazel, 
but I really don't have any steady income from Chestnut + Hazel yet.

377

I have to tell you this because
it may be
relevant to
the question

You seek to answer and it may
be what you
need to know
to satiate the
obsessions that

are eating away at your mind and
every thought
you have:
GUESS WHAT! 
BUTTER! IS!
NOT THE!
ANSWER!!!

when there is mail in the mailbox and 
there is new mail in the mailbox and there 
are letters that can be read and there are notices 
from where you are and where you are not. 
and you were happy with what you've done and 
how you did it and where you did it and.

379

I made an effort set up an account to self publish a book. 
It would be the Chestnut Street series. I have to take a 
look at it and see what changes I would make to the text.

It's midnight. I'm hungry, and I don't know where to go to eat.

I went to the Cannery Casino to eat at the Victory Cafe, 
but it wasn't open. Google Maps said it was open 24 Hrs, 
but I guess that wasn't accurate, so I ended up at Bourbon 
Street Bar and Grill. I had wings, but I wasn't too excited 
about them, they just seemed excessively battered, but I was 
really hungry and I'm really not sure what other options I had.

380

These are the things I think
about when I think about 
butter: well, first and foremost
butter is not what makes the
world go round. Something.
some kind of force makes
the world go round, and I 
think that the force in question
would be called momentum,
or maybe it would be called 
inertia, but whatever the force
is called, I doubt that it
is called butter, and therefore!
when people ask what force
makes the world go round
just be aware that butter is 
not the answer to that question!

Sometimes when I go out to eat I get the feeling 
that the food was microwaved after being pulled 
out of a bag from something I could have purchased 
from the frozen food section of the grocery store.

I went and got an oil change, which was something 
I've been meaning to do for a while, and when I was 
getting the oil change, the technician recommended 
that I get my transmission fluid changed, so I did 
that as well. I really don't want to spend more than 
I need to right now, but I know that I've put a hell 
of a lot of miles on my car over the last few months, 
so I need to weigh being cautious with my spending 
against the risks of unexpected car problems from 
skipping on maintenance now.

382

I have to think. I was thinking about pursuing a graduate 
certificate in Spanish Translation at UNLV. One issue is 
that out-of-state tuition would make this cost prohibitive, 
but it's possible that my time in Nevada during 2018 would 
count toward my status as a Nevada resident, this is something 
I have to look into, and I'd probably have to request records 
from the Nevada DMV.

That UTA thing was a total disaster. I'm trying to squeeze 
as much out of the experience as I can by going through the 
course material, but. Yeah, that was a real interesting way 
to flush $3,500 down the toilet.

I need to explore as many programs at as many universities as 
I can. I really would prefer an in-person program rather than 
something remote, or online. I'm still kind of hesitant to look 
at anything. I'm hesitant to pursue a different graduate program 
unless I know that it will be the right fit for me. I don't know 
if there is any possibility of heading back to Texas for one semester, 
and just taking two classes or whatever, but, who knows.

I really want to buy new pants, and 
a new belt, but I also really want to 
hold off on doing either, and yet, 
even though I really want to keep my 
spending as low as possible, I went out 
to eat earlier today and I went out for 
drinks the other day. I went out for 
drinks the other night, and it was supposed 
to be a kind of date, but, we didn't end up 
meeting up. I went to the place she wanted 
to meet up at, but she wasn't there. I waited 
for about an hour, and then went home, and 
like five minutes after I was on my way home, 
she said she was there, and that I should turn 
around and come back.

386

That was discouraging, so I'm going to take a break from online dating. 
This is the second time I deleted, second or maybe third time I've deleted 
a dating profile in the last month. I switched accounts for some of my 
autopay expenses, and I'm kind of just waiting until the switch over becomes active.

Queen of the Goths

she's cute, 
and. 
she's kind of talking to herself, 
and. 
it seems like a very 
engaging conversation,
but 
maybe she's singing,
and
she doesn't have a headset on,
so
she's either singing
from memory
or
talking to herself.

388

what a nightmare. it's night time right now. 
I think that I've been putting 
this together for the past 4 hours or so.

389

I settled the account with UTA. That was a fucking pain in the ass. 
I don't know how many times I've gone over this situation on my blog, 
but I'll go over it again. I was originally awarded 10500 in student 
loans, but after withdrawing from the MSQF program, that amount was 
reduced to about 8500, these are all rough numbers but they're close 
enough, anyway, I was asked to return 2000 dollars to the University, UTA, 
and I just remitted the payment of 2000 bucks a few minutes ago. Headache. 
I really wasn't prepared for this. Anyway. I was really going to put this 
whole ordeal off for a while, but when I looked into my student loan account, 
or the account that services my student loans, I noticed that they adjusted 
the student loan amount from 10500 to 8500, so I figured since the issue that 
I was worried about most has been fixed, then I guess I'm comfortable settling 
the balance with UTA. The issue that I was afraid of was paying twice, so to 
speak, but if the loan servicer adjusted the amount due, then there is no need 
to worry about paying twice, and that's why I figured I'd settle the tab at UTA.

390

One of the issues I'm dealing with right now 
is that I have a balance due on my student 
account at the University of Texas at Arlington. 
This is because I dropped all of my classes and 
withdrew from the MSQF program. My student loan 
allocation for the Fall 2022 semester was reduced 
retroactively, and now I have to pay back one-thousand 
eight-hundred and sixty-five dollars. I was originally 
awarded about ten-thousand in student loans, but that 
award has been reduced retroactively to around eight-thousand 
three-hundred. This is a fucking nightmare.

I'm making quite a few changes to my blog. It is just 
going to be text, mostly. and pictures I'll put somewhere 
else, or I'll create a new page for photographs that I've 
accumulated over time.

391

I went to the gas station 
to get a fountain drink, 
and by the time
I get home, my soda is
gone? Where did it go?
I think I drank it all!

I went to the buffet at the Wynn and even though 
I thought that the buffet was really nice, I don't 
think that I got my money's worth, I just didn't eat 
enough. I went in the morning, around 10 AM, and it 
was really crowded, and then afterward I went driving 
around town looking for something interesting. I tend 
to take this blog in different directions and revise 
things here or there depending on my mood, and as a 
result it's changing constantly, and it keeps changing 
and it will continue to change and I'm not sure how to 
feel about that. things were going well and things were 
all about to go even better but they did not and when I 
think about where everything went they went worse than anything.

392

I'm pretty light now in terms of personal possessions. 
I'm wondering what else is sellable on Facebook Marketplace. 
I kept two hammers that I really like, they're really new, 
and they are both really well made. Well, I think that it's a 
total of three hammers that I kept, one is a jeweler's hammer. 
I'm worried about the next few months. I could potentially have 
a huge tax bill, and I have a limited number of options to reduce 
my tax liabilities before the end of the year. Maybe this is one 
of those years where I just have to eat it.

remember the citrus (2022)

This is where the things 
that you think that you 
remember turn out to be 
memories that you yourself invented

You enjoyed the taste of
the lemonade but really
what you drank was orange 
juice and you think that you
tasted citrus but you really enjoyed 
the taste of oranges and not 
lemons

She told you to drink from the tap
like a man, but you just really weren't 
into that, you really didn't want to drink
from the tap, you are okay drinking from
the fountain you are okay when you drink
fountain drinks but you are not okay
drinking from the tap

Lemonade does not come from
the tap, even when the tap is loaded
with lemonade,

lemonade only comes from the soda
fountain, even though lemonade is not
soda

we can be friends
actually we can't even
be friends 
you're just too fucking weird

you do weird shit and i 
don't want to be associated
with you in 
anyway

These wilted flowers shedding 
petals blissfully in the sad faced sun.

sure it was totally harmless and

There was a minor disappointment the other day. I asked someone 
for a letter of recommendation, and she didn't want to do it. We 
met at some bar in Kentucky back in June, and we chatted, and I 
asked for her phone number and email address, stating that I might 
need a letter of recommendation at some point in the future. I sent 
her a message on LinkedIn the other day, asking for the letter of 
recommendation and she basically isn't familiar enough with me to 
really make any kind of recommendation one way or another. She also 
asked me not to ask her again.

395

I did get a letter showing that my registration for an 
Assumed Name has been recorded with the Tarrant County Clerk. 
The Registration for my copyrights for some of my Letters from 
Sanford Street haven't been dealt with by the U.S. Copyright Office, 
and my Assumed Name registrations haven't been recorded with the 
Secretary of State of Texas, and, other government related bullshit, 
well, the Town of Panama Called me about a speeding ticket that was 
issued several months back, they weren't aggressive or anything, but 
they just told me that I can pay the ticket over the phone, so I did 
that. I tried paying it online, but I received an error message, and 
I wasn't able to pay it online, so I sent the Town of Panama, or maybe 
I sent it to the County of LeFlore, but I sent a letter with screenshots 
of the issue, or a printout of screenshots of the issue.

396

I did something interesting the other day, well, a few things actually, 
I sold additional stuff on Facebook, the previous day I sold a sledgehammer, 
axe, and pickaxe, I'm really not sure why I bought those things, but yesterday 
I sold eight hammers, smaller ones than the ones I sold on Facebook a few days 
before. Another thing that I did that I would say is interesting is that I bought 
US Treasury bonds. Well, US Treasury Bills actually. There are a number of 
different securities that you can buy from the US Treasury, there are savings 
bonds, and those are why I was setting up the TreasuryDirect account, it seems 
that I can only buy US Treasury Savings Bonds through the TreasuryDirect account, 
but anyway, the other day I bought US Treasury Bills through my Fidelity account.

I went to the DMV, and they don't take walk-ins anymore, 
everything is by appointment only, and this works, because 
I set up my appointment already, and it's for next month, and 
I have everything I need, the emissions inspection, my insurance 
has been changed to Nevada, I have documents with my new address 
on it, and, I had the VIN inspection performed. Is there anything 
else that I need to get done? I don't think so. I did set up a 
TreasuryDirect account, or, I mean, I got the process started. It 
isn't as simple as setting up an online account, setting up the online 
account is only part of the process, the other part of the process is 
mailing in another form that needs to be reviewed by your bank. I went 
to Citibank on Aliante Parkway. One of the strange things about the 
Dallas / Fort Work area is that I don't remember any Citibank branches 
in the area.

My schedule for tomorrow, Monday morning, is to 
head to the DMV to get my Driver's License, and 
Vehicle Registration complete, and I was also 
informed that I need a VIN inspection to be performed, 
which is something that I was told while getting my 
Emissions inspection performed. The guy at the Emissions 
inspection place informed me that the number of times a 
vehicle has been registered refers to when a vehicle is 
purchased, and when the vehicles registration is renewed, 
so if a person owns a car for 3 years or whatever, there's 
the original registration, as well as two subsequent renewal 
registrations, which would count for a total of 3 registrations. 
Anyway, after I get that done, there is some paperwork that I 
need taken care of at the bank to open an account with the U.S. 
Treasury to buy savings bonds. I'm not sure how useful setting 
up this account will be, but I think that I'll go ahead and do it.

401

I went to the buffet with my mom earlier, and we just got back. 
The fortune cookie said: Opportunity always knocks at the least 
opportune time, and I thought to myself: that's almost always true, 
but how do I overcome that tendency for things, for opportunities 
to be available when I really can't capitalize on them? and what 
opportunities should I be on the lookout for, and be prepared for?

I'm reading spam messages from one of these bogus dating websites 
I signed up for. It's one of those dating sites where you have to 
pay per message. The obvious thing is that I'm getting tons of 
incoming messages, and I doubt that these women are really paying 
a dollar a message to reach out to my incomplete profile. If they 
were, then I'm making that website a whole bunch of money with my 
incomplete profile.

Valentine's Day in October (2022)

but what
is there
to do now
that you are bored
and what
can you tell me
now that you
have nothing
else to say

and try sending
me a candy bar
and try sending me
a chocolate
bar and
try sending me a greeting
card and try sending
me something romantic
and try sending me something
that I might like
and try sending me
something that might have
meaning to you
and try telling me
something

try telling my something
that I didn't know before
and try saying
something to me
that would

flatter me
and try flattering me
try getting me to
get interested in you

and try getting me to
want to see what
you are having
for a snack
and what fruits are out
of season.

you know what my favorite color is!
and you know what color
your favorite color is
and you know who my favorite person
is and you know who 
your favorite person is!

and this is what I've been wanting
you to say to me this
entire time and you
just haven't come around to
saying it to me.

you really
can't tell me
that everything
is bad right now
because I know
that you're happy

you can't tell me that you
are unhappy because
I know what you like
and I know what 

makes
you 

happy and
I know what pleases
you and I am aware
of your likes and
dislikes.

Some
of the things
that you like are
kind of odd
and
some of the things
you like
are kind of strange
and some of the things
you like are
acquired tastes

and some of the
problems that
you get yourself
into over and
over are things
that you could
refrain from
getting yourself
into.

i had no idea
that someone had
a crush
on you
and i had no idea
someone was somewhat
obsessed
with you and i had
no idea that the feelings
were true and genuine
and i had no idea
that someone would
ever be attracted
to you and i had
no idea that jealousy
was an issue
that you would
have to deal with

she really liked you
and
you didn't realize it
and
you seemed to think
that
everything was not
what
it seemed and you seemed
to
imagine that you were
in 
control when really you
were
something of a puppet

do you like being
back there do you
like being back where
you were and did
you like visiting other
parts of the country
and did you like seeing
places that you've never
seen before and do you
remember what it was
like to be here and do
you think that you'll
ever do that again
and do you think that
you will ever do that

again 

and do you feel
that the rest is more
interesting and do you
think that the rest
of the world is rounder

but I'm not sure if I ran into
you at the Pizza Parlor and
you pointed out to me that the
toppings are beneath the cheese
or if the cheese is placed on top
of the toppings the bartender
asked me to leave and I'm 
really not sure why

i don't know if it's because i missed
you when i most definitely should have
noticed you and 
i don't know if i missed you when
i kind of set myself on a different path
and i don't know what the hell was
going on there
and i don't know if I forgot to
wash my hands before eating
and the
pizza seemed to arrive sooner
than i expected.

she actually really liked
you and it's obvious
that you really cared about
her even though she was
obviously a trouble maker
and she clearly would 
make life difficult for you
if she didn't get what she
wanted from you and now
you are out of college and
now you are lonely and now
you have to start all over again

an update to how things
are going right now. again
it seems I'm being demonetized
for something on my blog. I'm
getting rid of the suspected content
but there really wasn't anything
specific pointed out. and so
I'm going around deleting what
could be offensive.

it was weird. before i left she
came over and asked me to
take her out for dinner, and
i had been wanting to take her
out for dinner for a while. we
went out a few times. i don't 
think that she really liked me.
maybe she did, but i always
felt that she felt that she had
a better option, or that she liked
someone else more. sometimes
i'd be somewhere in the neighborhood
and then BANG she was there too.

we went to dinner. she came over
and asked me to take her out
to dinner, and we got into kind of
an argument when we were there.

and now the Nevada DMV website
is down, it's actually down and the
whole department is actually taking
time off until the issue is resolved.
so, even if I new what documents to
bring to a walk-in, i couldn't even
go if i wanted to because the offices
are closed.

i'm spending additional time cleaning up things here and
it just never seems to end there are so many
dirty things here that are not appropriate for the rules. the
rules
say that this stuff is not
okay
it is not okay to have yourself saying
and writing what you are saying and writing about

i went all the way across
town to go to a buffet called
imperial sushi and seafood.
it was a long drive. the food
was really nice, and, for 36
bucks it was worth the money,
but the drive was a nightmare.
maybe i just haven't ever been 
used to rush hour traffic. I don't
know why.

403

What the hell opportunity should I be on 
the lookout for? I'm thinking that I really 
want as much overtime as I can get these next 
few months, and I really think that overtime 
opportunities are the opportunities that I 
should be looking out for. When I think about 
other opportunities that just didn't happen at the 
right time, graduate school was one of those 
opportunities that just didn't coincide with the 
optimal time period in my life to be going to graduate 
school. I did just get out of the mental health institution, 
and things were just difficult all around. Then there was the 
opportunity to get into the software developer program at Amazon, 
and for some reason there was just always something else that 
popped up, usually just overtime opportunities.

There is something that I found that I might actually be 
interested in using some of the software development skills 
for, I might be interested in using some of my software development 
skills to convert my blog entries into integer sequences that I can 
post on OeisWiki or the OEIS Wiki. I vaguely remember how to do this, 
but it's something like, when the code comes across a certain letter, 
or character, it returns a specific integer, but there were other 
things that I remember that I think I can do, like, I think I'm able 
to turn images into integer sequences.

I'm trying to think. I did look up the subject of DanishCookieUXorious 
while I was clearing out my old bookmarks, and this was interesting 
because I really remember her being blonde, and for a minute I wanted 
to look up that poem I wrote about the bartender on Collins. I could 
have sworn. It happens over and over again. I could have sworn that 
person was blonde.

This free time that I'm having is an opportunity, free time is always 
an opportunity that's. It's the kind of opportunity that I'm unfamiliar 
with capitalizing on. What do I do?

you like are
acquired tastes

and some of the
problems that
you get yourself
into over and
over are things
that you could
refrain from
getting yourself
into.

i had no idea
that someone had
a crush
on you
and i had no idea
someone was somewhat
obsessed
with you and i had
no idea that the feelings
were true and genuine
and i had no idea
that someone would
ever be attracted
to you and i had
no idea that jealousy
was an issue
that you would
have to deal with

she really liked you
and
you didn't realize it
and
you seemed to think
that
everything was not
what
it seemed and you seemed
to
imagine that you were
in 
control when really you
were
something of a puppet

do you like being
back there do you
like being back where
you were and did
you like visiting other
parts of the country
and did you like seeing
places that you've never
seen before and do you
remember what it was
like to be here and do
you think that you'll
ever do that again
and do you think that
you will ever do that

again 

and do you feel
that the rest is more
interesting and do you
think that the rest
of the world is rounder

but I'm not sure if I ran into
you at the Pizza Parlor and
you pointed out to me that the
toppings are beneath the cheese
or if the cheese is placed on top
of the toppings the bartender
asked me to leave and I'm 
really not sure why

i don't know if it's because i missed
you when i most definitely should have
noticed you and 
i don't know if i missed you when
i kind of set myself on a different path
and i don't know what the hell was
going on there
and i don't know if I forgot to
wash my hands before eating
and the
pizza seemed to arrive sooner
than i expected.

she actually really liked
you and it's obvious
that you really cared about
her even though she was
obviously a trouble maker
and she clearly would 
make life difficult for you
if she didn't get what she
wanted from you and now
you are out of college and
now you are lonely and now
you have to start all over again

an update to how things
are going right now. again
it seems I'm being demonetized
for something on my blog. I'm
getting rid of the suspected content
but there really wasn't anything
specific pointed out. and so
I'm going around deleting what
could be offensive.

it was weird. before i left she
came over and asked me to
take her out for dinner, and
i had been wanting to take her
out for dinner for a while. we
went out a few times. i don't 
think that she really liked me.
maybe she did, but i always
felt that she felt that she had
a better option, or that she liked
someone else more. sometimes
i'd be somewhere in the neighborhood
and then BANG she was there too.

we went to dinner. she came over
and asked me to take her out
to dinner, and we got into kind of
an argument when we were there.

and now the Nevada DMV website
is down, it's actually down and the
whole department is actually taking
time off until the issue is resolved.
so, even if I new what documents to
bring to a walk-in, i couldn't even
go if i wanted to because the offices
are closed.

i'm spending additional time cleaning up things here and
it just never seems to end there are so many
dirty things here that are not appropriate for the rules. the
rules
say that this stuff is not
okay
it is not okay to have yourself saying
and writing what you are saying and writing about

i went all the way across
town to go to a buffet called
imperial sushi and seafood.
it was a long drive. the food
was really nice, and, for 36
bucks it was worth the money,
but the drive was a nightmare.
maybe i just haven't ever been 
used to rush hour traffic. I don't
know why.

405

I think that I have everything I need to get set 
up with a driver's license and vehicle registration 
in Nevada. I needed statements from a bank or credit 
card, and I have that now, I had to print them up, so 
I went to the UPS store, but they wanted quite a bit 
of money to print them. Like five bucks, so I went to 
the library instead. It was still more than I wanted 
to pay, but it was two dollars total, one to renew my 
library card, and another dollar to print the documents 
I needed.

I feel funny, that I pinch pennies with certain things, 
but I spend money on some of my bad habits. I got a letter 
from Coppell, Texas. It wasn't anything Texas related. 
Strange. I don't know what was going on those last few months 
in Texas, but I swear, everything was spiraling down the 
shitter. It really was. Everything was really spiraling 
down the shitter. Nearly everyone I came across, or, 95 
percent, seemed to be in a mood to start some kind of an argument.

406

what could I be doing right now? i can't really 
think of anything, and I don't really want to rush 
into anything. I have time, and I should be using 
it for something, but what?

407

I have most of everything that I need to complete 
my change of residence from Texas to Nevada, and 
to request a Nevada Driver's License and to register 
my vehicle in Nevada. The main thing that helped me 
was an account that I set up with Bank of America 
on a whim, just a savings account. Like I said, I 
set it up on a whim, and I'm not sure why I set 
it up, but the statement cycle just finished, most 
of my other accounts have statement cycles that 
would end later in the month, and so, if I were 
to have waited for any of the other accounts 
to issue a new statement with my updated address, 
it would probably be another week. The issue that 
I'm having, right now, however, is that the Nevada 
DMV website is not working. It's down or something. 
It's not loading.

408

that was a garbage kind of a thing a 
kind of disaster kind of a nightmare 
a kind of worst than anything a kind of 
thing that didn't go well a kind of horse 
that cannot be ridden. a kind of donkey.

409

What was the first issue that I was facing when 
it came to graduate school? Group work, and group 
projects. I just really hate doing them, and they're 
rarely ever a collaborative effort. Most of the time 
there's this dynamic of establishing a pecking order. 
I don't want to make a contribution if I'm just going 
to be discredited for any work that I do. In this case, 
the person that I was originally assigned to work with. 
She was positioning herself in a way where, I would basically 
work on something, and I would have to run it by her first, 
and she would either say yes or no on it, and I thought that 
was shitty, like, fuck that, why doesn't she just do all the 
work, and I have the final say on it.

410

This was back from UTA. 
I still really do not 
like doing group work.

There was a group project for MIS 764
and. well. there is a group project for MIS 764 
and you know. it's something that's going on right now.
but I still really wish that I could be working 
independently.

Valentine's Day in October (2022)

but what
is there
to do now
that you are bored
and what
can you tell me
now that you
have nothing
else to say

and try sending
me a candy bar
and try sending me
a chocolate
bar and
try sending me a greeting
card and try sending
me something romantic
and try sending me something
that I might like
and try sending me
something that might have
meaning to you
and try telling me
something

try telling my something
that I didn't know before
and try saying
something to me
that would

flatter me
and try flattering me
try getting me to
get interested in you

and try getting me to
want to see what
you are having
for a snack
and what fruits are out
of season.

you know what my favorite color is!
and you know what color
your favorite color is
and you know who my favorite person
is and you know who 
your favorite person is!

and this is what I've been wanting
you to say to me this
entire time and you
just haven't come around to
saying it to me.

you really
can't tell me
that everything
is bad right now
because I know
that you're happy

you can't tell me that you
are unhappy because
I know what you like
and I know what 

makes
you 

happy and
I know what pleases
you and I am aware
of your likes and
dislikes.

Some
of the things
that you like are
kind of odd
and
some of the things
you like
are kind of strange
and some of the things
you like are

I should probably just forget about graduate 
school altogether. I don't want to be in a 
position where, the only thing I do is spend 
all of my time working for someone else, or 
doing someone else's work, pay tuition and 
shit for doing so, and in the process get 
discredited for any work that I do.

413

These things have not been here 
the whole time, and they have 
not been the best of the best, and 
they have not been the sticks of the butter.

She asked me to send a photograph
of me, stroking a stick of butter, and
I had to tell the girl that it wasn't
really what she was after, and she
really did not want me to send her
a photograph
of me stroking a stick of butter.

What she really wanted was a video
of me making a duck bill with my hand
and sticking my duck bill hand into
a bowl of butter, sticks of butter
are not the answer!

Places that I think about. 
I might not see them again, 
but places that I've been to, 
that I might not see again, that 
I think about. Gallup, New Mexico, 
Somerville, Tennessee, and 
La Vergne, Tennessee.

and while some people wish upon a 
star, it's totally possible that I would
have to wish upon a stick of butter
and tell people that the butter, that
praying to a stick of butter, that
wishing upon a stick of butter is 
not the solution to the
it's not the solution to whatever issue
you are having.

414

I bought a carton of eggnog and drank it all. 
I'm kind of just hanging out in my car and I'm 
probably going to go back in and get something else. 
There's nothing to do at home, but I'm not bored to the 
point that I really want to go prowl the streets. I think 
that I've taken care of most of the stuff, the preliminary 
stuff related to relocating, I have to change my addresses 
in my accounts first, then once I have statements, then I 
can go to the Nevada DMV to request a Nevada Driver's 
License, and then I can request Nevada Vehicle Registration.

415

Yeah, I really don't know what to do. 
I don't have any specific plans for the 
future, and maybe I should just leave it 
that way. Maybe I should just go with the 
flow until something comes up, or an 
opportunity comes up. 

These are basically the things I need in Life to Eat the
butter, but I already established that 
Butter is not the answer, and
yet you did not listen to me.

Stay where the people are rather than
going to that place where the invisible
people are. That's where the nest is and
where the birds go.

416

Yeah, I really don't know what to do. I don't have 
any specific plans for the future, and maybe I should 
just leave it that way. Maybe I should just go with the 
flow until something comes up, or an opportunity comes up.

417

Well, I guess I can think of today as the 
date that I've moved to Las Vegas. Today is October 8th, 2022

from the Chestnut + Hazel archive, and I honestly found it very funny, but, also very sad and depressing as well. I don't know what I was thinking about when I wrote this poem. I really don't. I really think that it's funny. Right now I'm working on just cleaning up my blog and that's pretty much it.

Porn Videos

I'm thinking about creating a new genre of adult films.
Basically they will involve normeenas and gorblanas
engaging in shorblanification of their adamantios moogies.

It will be so nasty, that search engines will not run ads
involving normeenas and gorblanas doing anything at
all, even regular stuff like fishing and flying kites because

The association that people will have with normeenas and
gorblanas will be inherently pornographic, and the acts that
they engage in will be so disgusting that there will even be

Congressional hearings, all on C-Span, discussing the prospect
of regulating the acts that normeenas and gorblanas engage
in. Senators will run on platforms to regulate the normeenas

and gorblanas. Judges will be appointed who are strictly
opposed to sexual relationships between normeenas and
gorlanas. Anti-miscegenation legislation will be on the dockets

of every legislative body to restrict how normeenas and
gorblanas interact. Adoption agencies will be prohibited
from facilitating the adoption of progeny from these unions.

No one will be able to adopt a normeena-gorblana child.
Normeena-gorblana children who are not adopted will grow
up on the streets, selling teleomarkinites and shamdoobies

to make ends meet. They will steal mammyonography from
the adult bookshops and resell them at the swap meet and
flea market and on amazon and ebay and craigslist and letgo.

The normeena-gorblana rights commission will fight the 
oppression of the people, but the commission's funding will
come primarily from the adult film industry, and they will

not be taken seriously, or they will be seen as perpetuation
the perversions of the normeena-gorblana fetishists. A new
political party will emerge to protect the normeenas, and a

separate party will emerge to protect the gorblanas, and new
adult films will feature dirty talk between the two parties and
hardcore magazine will be sold, but buyers will need a permit

from the decency agency in order to buy them. A test will be
administered to see whether or not a person qualifies, only the
most sane and normal people will be allowed to but these books.

430

It's hot, and I'm fucking tired. 
I went out to eat, just fish and 
chips like I usually eat when I go 
out to eat. What the hell was I 
thinking about? I have to drop off 
my mail at the post office.

431

there was a woman at the post office 
and she said to me 
she asked me if 

i knew how to lick stamps.
if i was good.
at 
licking stamps?

how would I know that?
how would I know if I'm good at licking  
stamps?

What the hell do I have to do right now?

I'm glad the weekend is 
just a few hours away. 
it's hot.

the world burns the world 
the atmosphere is starting 
to turn into a kind of oven 
and we will all be cooked!

436

It was fried and that is just 
the way it is when things are cooked 
they are turned into food and have they 
been cooked or not have they 
been turned into a kind of food or have 
they not been cooked?

437

I think about times in my life where 
I'm going through the kinds of things I'm 
going through right now. I don't know how to 
describe how it's different this time, but it 
is different. It's different because things are 
confusing; I'm confused about how to deal with; 
I'm confused about how to move forward, and I'm 
confused about what to do next, but things aren't 
really all that bleak right now, things really aren't 
all that hopeless. Things are just confusing. I just 
really don't know what to do next.

438

maybe there is something else out there 
for you. something that you can do 
you are too dumb for this!

439

do you really think 
that I am too dumb for this?

440

no, i do not think you are too 
dumb for this.

441

I think that I'm just going to operate 
under the assumption that Nevada is where 
I'm going to be for now, and I'll just go 
through with getting a Nevada Driver's 
License, and Nevada Plates.

fabio was 
at the grocery store
his hair flowing
and his tits were
perkier than ever
he reached for a
stick of land o' lakes
and i told him
straight up
fabio
butter
is not the answer
and he said to me
a suave as ever
that he couldn't believe 
that butter is not the answer.

443

I keep coming across this 
poem called valentines day in october.

444

fabio was 
at the grocery store
his hair flowing
and his tits were
perkier than ever
he reached for a
stick of land o' lakes
and i told him
straight up
fabio
butter
is not the answer
and he said to me
a suave as ever
that he couldn't believe 
that butter is not the answer.

445

i did get back on the dating
apps today
and i'm actually not even telling
the truth in this case
but i've already had tons of
flirtation bots 
hitting me up
believe me
i know what this
woman is up to
she's the kind of woman
who puts butter on
her pancakes
but a woman who
puts butter on her
pancakes is not the
answer
and butter
is still never the
fucking answer.

446

is there anything 
else you would 
like to tell me?

447

no, you will find out 
the hard way!

448

what do you mean by that?

449

you can search the whole world
for the fucking answer
but
butter
is not the fucking answer.

there are so many questions in life,
and one of those
questions might be
whether or not
butter is the answer.
butter is not the answer.

450

You can see what the
majority of us see and 
you can tell me what you
are looking for, but most 
of the things that we are 
looking for are irrelevant to
the objective we are
trying to accomplish,
and these are not what
the people want, and these
are not what the people
are thinking of.

451

what people really want
and what people are really 
thinking about
is that butter. is. the answer to
all of the problems of
the human condition,
but really,
butter,
is never the answer.

452

I don't want you 
to tell anyone
this because it gives 
us a competitive advantage
over the competition, and we
want to have an advantage 
over the competition
because they
are incompetent, and do

not deserve to defeat us
in this highly competitive
environment.
Well? What it
it that I want to tell you
that I don't want 
the competition
to be aware of?
It's this, and this alone:
BUTTER IS NOT THE ANSWER!

453

I'm thinking. I have no idea 
what I should be doing right now.

454

but what
is there
to do now
that you are bored
and what
can you tell me
now that you
have nothing
else to say

455

and try sending

try getting me to
get interested in you

and try getting me to

458

you know what my favorite color is!
and you know what color
your favorite color is
and you know who my favorite person
is and you know who 
your favorite person is!

and this is what I've been wanting
you to say to me this
entire time and you
just haven't come around to
saying it to me.

459

you really
can't tell me
that everything
is bad right now
because I know
that you're happy

you can't tell me that you
are unhappy because
I know what you like
and I know what 

makes
you 

happy and
I know what pleases
you and I am aware
of your likes and
dislikes.

460

Some
of the things
that you like are
kind of odd
and
some of the things
you like
are kind of strange
and some of the things
you like are

i had no idea
that someone had
a crush
on you
and i had no idea
someone was somewhat
obsessed
with you and i had
no idea that the feelings
were true and genuine
and i had no idea
that someone would
ever be attracted
to you and i had
no idea that jealousy
was an issue
that you would
have to deal with

she really liked you
and
you didn't realize it
and
you seemed to think
that
everything was not
what
it seemed and you seemed
to
imagine that you were
in 
control when really you
were
something of a puppet

462

do you like being
back there do you
like being back where
you were and did
you like visiting other
parts of the country
and did you like seeing
places that you've never
seen before and do you
remember what it was
like to be here and do
you think that you'll
ever do that again
and do you think that
you will ever do that

again 

and do you feel
that the rest is more
interesting and do you
think that the rest
of the world is rounder

but I'm not sure if I ran into
you at the Pizza Parlor and
you pointed out to me that the
toppings are beneath the cheese
or if the cheese is placed on top
of the toppings the bartender
asked me to leave and I'm 
really not sure why

i don't know if it's because i missed
you when i most definitely should have
noticed you and 
i don't know if i missed you when
i kind of set myself on a different path
and i don't know what the hell was
going on there
and i don't know if I forgot to
wash my hands before eating
and the
pizza seemed to arrive sooner
than i expected.

I just applied for a position here in Las Vegas, and, 
I'll continue to look for work. I don't think that I'll 
be heading back to Arlington, it just seems like it's really 
not going to happen. I'm putting a few other things on the 
back burner for now. Like continuing to work on Chestnut + Hazel, 
more specifically, business registration aspects of it. I tried 
looking for positions at Amazon, but there was nothing available 
in the area. I was thinking that, since it's somewhat easy to 
transfer between locations with Amazon, that maybe I'd get in 
at a location here, and then, if something were to bring me back 
to Dallas / Fort Worth, that maybe I'd transfer back there. There's 
just nothing really in Dallas / Fort Worth, though, other than college, 
and even that was kind of falling apart. 

I did file a copyright for a few of my posts from the Letters from 
Sanford Street series, I used the "Online Literary Works" form, and 
it was somewhat more involved than using the Standard Registration 
process, but it does allow me to have claims on each individual post, 
rather than having a single claim one gigantic series. In this specific 
case, even though there is a single application for the 14 posts that 
I registered, each post is registered as part of a larger registration, 
using the previous method that I used, I would have to compile all the 
posts into a single post, and then register that single post as 
a "Collective Work" that I'd have a claim on. 

This distinction probably 
isn't obvious to someone who doesn't 
register copyrights, but an analogy 
that might make this easier to understand, 
is that it's like having 14 
different deeds to 14 different 1 acre plots of 
land, rather than having 
1 deed to a single 14 acre plot of land.

465

another issue when registering copyright
that I'm kind of coming into right now is 
the issue of a work that has multiple authors.

I want to register some of the things that I worked
on for MIS 764, but, technically everything was a group 
assignment, so technically everything has three authors.
and technically, everything has three owners, since I think 
in this case authorship and ownership would be the same.

similar to the analogy above, if a 10 acre plot of land has 
three owners, each owner has a 33.3% interest in that 10 acre 
plot of land, they don't have 3.33 acres each.

466

I also set up a mailbox at the UPS Store for my business, 
Chestnut + Hazel, and, even though I'm putting off registering 
the business in Clark County for the time being, I'm sure that 
I'll come around to it at some point.

467

What I'm I dealing with right now? 
I tried withdrawing from the MSQF 
program at UTA, but it's not as simple 
as clicking a button and withdrawing, 
and dropping out, if it was that easy, 
that's probably what I would have done; 
on the one hand, I don't really want to 
drop out, and on the other hand, I don't 
really see myself going back to the 
Dallas / Fort Worth area.

468

I really don't see myself ever going back to the 
Dallas/ Fort Worth area, but it's possible that one circumstance 
or another might lead me right back there. It was one circumstance 
or another that brought me to the Dallas / Fort Worth area in the 
first place, maybe one circumstance or another might bring me back 
there, but I really don't see that happening.

469

Who knows what could happen between now and December? 
Anything in the universe could happen between now and December, 
and so it might make sense for me to keep my options open, and 
that's kind of why I'm seeking "incompletes" for my courses, 
rather than withdrawing from the courses completely and 
dropping out of the MSQF program. 

While I'm here in Las Vegas I should probably find 
work. One of the issues about finding work here in 
Las Vegas is that once I start looking for work and 
once I start really setting myself up here in Las Vegas, 
it becomes less and less likely that I'll return to 
Dallas / Fort Worth. I didn't really have anything 
going on for me, other than graduate school, that was 
really keeping me in Dallas / Fort Work, and I was 
facing a number of issues in addition to not really 
being able to get anything done in terms of course 
work and in terms of studying, I had a number of 
problems going on that I really would rather not mention.

It feels strange being back in Las Vegas, 
passing by the city skyline it just seems small 
in comparison to the DFW area. I really only saw 
the Dallas skyline a hand full of times, a few 
times when I moved to Dallas in 2020, and then, 
usually each time I left the area on a road trip. 
I feel funny. This feels really weird. Being back here. 
It feels different, it feels really different this time. 
Being here. Well, guess what is on my mind? it isn't 
popcorn, and it isn't corn on the cob! the only thing 
that I'm thinking about right now is how butter is simply

if I would have started a life out there. It wouldn't have been clear to me what I would 
have done for work, or if there really was any work out there for me to do. I'm still so 
unsure about this whole thing about being back in Nevada.

I'm not sure what I would have done for work, or where

interesting at the hotel I stayed at. The hotel was 
actually somewhat fancy, and some of the other hotels 
in the area, the ones that seemed abandoned, or worn 
down, or otherwise kind of lousy, were the ones I really 
wanted to stay at. I wanted to stay at a cheaper motel, 
or cheaper hotel or something that was cheap, and also 
looked cheap. The desk agent was actually a person who was telecommuting.

I'm leaving Texas and heading back to Las Vegas. I'm taking the time to sit down and write something. 
I remember 
coming down here. I mean, to Texas, years ago when I first moved here, and I almost headed back to 
Las Vegas 
after the first few nights here. I remember just driving around the state for a while, and then 
staying in 
the DFW area, and then tried to head to Vegas, but for some reason I ended up staying here. 

I completed 
the dba stuff at the UPS store when I got back here, it's the same place I set up an address at when 
I first 
came to Texas. Well, there are two separate governing bodies that dba registration have to be filed 
with, Tarrant 
County, and the Texas Secretary of State, I did the registration with the Secretary of State when I 
was 
in Little Rock, Arkansas because it didn't require being notarized by a notary in Tarrant County.

and so, now I backtrack. 
I head all the way back to Tarrant County, 
and then I head to Vegas. I feel like my life 
is nothing but a series of going in one 
fucking direction, and then back-tracking. 
Let's just figure out this dba bullshit first.

i have 2 
fucking days.

I have to head all the way back to 
Tarrant County, and then figure out 
where to go from there. I mean. I 
guess I'll head over to Vegas. I mean, 
I have to figure out the whole school 
thing, and I really think it might be 
easier to just go to UTA, and somehow, 
you know, express the extraordinary 
challenges that I've faced these last few weeks.

butter is something that comes from a cow 
when you squeeze the cow in a very specific 
way and when you have an olive and you squeeze 
the olive in a very specific way you get olive oil 
and when you find yourself eating breadsticks and you 
find youself asking if the breadsticks were coated 
in butter, it is possible that butter is not the answer.

probably what I would have done; on the one hand, I don't really 
want to drop out, and on the other hand, I don't really see myself 
going back to the Dallas / Fort Worth area.

504

there were things 
that I discovered 
out there in the wilderness.
and there were things 
that I saw that I 
didn't want to see.

505

Butter is not the Answer # 1
nor is butter made of oil 
nor are there alternatives
to vegetable oil 
nor are there things that are

remember what set me 
off on that First road 
trip in June, or the one 
in February, or any of these. 
Maybe I was thinking about 
relocating. I don't remember. 
I think that I'm going to 
relocate this time, but what 
the hell am I going to do 
for work? How the hell do 
I get set up in a new town?

507

things that were there were 
things that were always new 
and were things that were doable and 
we cannot have a meeting because 
you are not available to meet with me 
during a time that would work 
for us both but when there 
are times that work for 
you there are times 
that may or may not work
for me.

508

one thing that I often face that 
impedes my ability to get anything 
done is the avalanche of emails that 
I have to deal with, or that fall into 
my mail box. I obviously don't read them 
all, but I usually scan them to see if they 
contain anything important. or are just useless.

509

most of the time they are just useless 
and they just ask me millions 
of various questions.

510

you are not allowed 
to be a mean person.

511

Thinking. I'm going to hold off on 
looking for work right 
now. or looking 
for an internship or anything like that.

I really should just be 
focusing on school right now.

512

there were a bunch of things that I 
saw the other day that really scared me.
Class Notes Starting September 14th, 2022 

there was an orange on the table 
and there was a man squeezing the orange 
and putting all the juice inside 
of a cup.

itself into a bottle of orange juice.

i dont know what happened the other day. 
but i seemed to have irritated the 
bartender at this pizza place i went to. 
I really didn't understand what happened.

she seemed upset about something. she said that she wanted me to leave. so i paid and left.
a guy chased after me, and said: "No one here thinks that's funny."
and i still have no idea what i did, or what offense i committed.

i remember, i asked where the basil was, and a woman behind me said:
"the toppings are placed underneath the cheese here."
and i responded: "you're right about that, i've eaten here before."

and then i just sort of went at it with my pizza,
and then the bartender became upset.
my nails were dirty, really dirty, and i was eating two slices of pizza at a time. like a pig.
and maybe that was the thing, she was irritated that i was eating like a pig.

but.
i think that i was eating with a fork and knife first, and then
i started eating with my hands.
maybe i should just change my major or something.
i really fucking wanted to go to school, but, i don't really know what the hell to do.

516

there was something 
funny at a restaurant the 
other day. I ate 
tacos with chorizo as meat 
for the first time ever and the 
guy asked me 

what do you 
normally eat chorizo with
or he asked 
how do you normally eat chorizo 

and i said that I normally eat 
chorizo with rice. 
i really do.

I try to buy stamps, twenty is too much for
one stamp, and she can't break bills, and
I can't have them all, I ask to trade stamps,
one for one, she's not sure that's okay,
so she phones a friend. she asks
if I have exact change and I say:
yes! I do.

520

I would later tell her that I need 
way more than stamps.
way more than just stamps I need 
way more than what you have to send
letters with.

i told her that i needed it all 
that I needed everything. 
i need it all I need everything.

but she didn't hear me she was already in 
the other neighborhood and she was delivering 
parcels and letters and she 
couldn't hear me because i was really just talking 
to myself.

you are frozen in

One of the companies that I looked at for 
internships has internships that I'm interested 
in, but it also has open positions that I'm 
interested in and that I think I'd be a good 
fit for. Several years ago I was considered a 
strong candidate for and received an offer for 
a position at a similar company when I was in 
Missouri, but I didn't take it, and the decision 
for not taking it is kind of complex.

I ran into you at the bar and we
had drinks and we ate bar food

to make friends, or catch up 
with family, or shoot the shit 
with random strangers. There's 
really just too much shit to do. 
There's really just too much fucking 
shit to do. People get made if you don't 
waste time, but there really isn't a 
hell of a lot of time to waste. Why 
don't we watch TV all day? Why don't 
we play computer games all day? Why 
don't we chat about politics and 
all this other shit? All fucking 
day? Well, for one thing: I have 
all kind of other shit that I need 
to do all fucking day. and if I'm 
going to waste time, I'm going to 
waste it the way I want to waste it.

I'm trying to fix my contact 
gadget for my blog. Jesus. 
Nightmare. I forgot how to do this.

604

I think. and I want to go over this again. I wanted
to take the programming class to work on my intellectual 
property catalog.
I really want to register a patent.

605

This is a notepad.

606

Nightmare.

here is where the wild things get wilder where 
they are stranger than they were where 
they get to be the best of all things.
and how they are nicer than they would have been.
Okay, so I fixed part of the problem

I haven't had a lot of time to do 
anything lately. maybe. maybe this 
is my opportunity to do something different.

608

I remember something funny. I remember, when 
I was working at Amazon, I applied for a position 
that one of the managers though I was underqualified 
for, so he gave me a hard time about it. I went to. 
I guess. The manager of all the managers at the site, 
and tried to clarify that I was just kind of. I guess. 
Trying to amuse myself by applying for one of the most 
awesome positions in the company that I could think of, 
and that I usually do this sort of thing when I'm unemployed, 
but I haven't been unemployed for the longest time, so I 
figured I would just do it anyway.

609

I didn't know that there was an election 
on 05/07/2022. I was asleep, and I didn't 
find out about it until the day after.

610

So. What am I going to do?

I'm going to file for unemployment. 
I doubt that I will have my claim approved, 
but it's. I think that it's important to file 
for unemployment, considering that I'm unemployed, 
um, because I think it's important to be part of 
the headcount of people who are not working, but 
looking for work. This is a nightmare, because, 
it feels like it just adds hassle to my day. I 
think of filing unemployment as similar to 
participating in the census. I guess. Maybe, 
filing for unemployment is kind of a waste of time, 
considering that I'm unlikely to get benefits, but, 
the maybe the same could be said about the census.

611

When it comes to dating. it seems 
that there is a kind of testing 
stage, with a subsequent authentication stage.

612

I don't know what to do. 
as far as work goes. I really don't.

orange juice was made with
all of the best sauces and all of the best
things that were all of the best 
things and all of the best fruits and 
all of the best things that were 
all of the best waters.

Do you have a minimum of two (2) when you told them.
I don't I really don't have what you need.
years of e-Commerce Global Data Synchronization 
when you ask me a question do not already be ready
Network or similar product do not tell me how these 
are the worst things that you can think of how these are the best 
things that you can do that these are the test that these are the 
limits of the toast. content platform experience in a private, 
public, government or military environment?
can you? eat everything that there was when you did.

613

Gibberish. pure gibberish is the answer 
to your question and it is how I will deal 
with this question that you are answering to me that you are telling
me that you are asking me that you were wondering about.

614

So today is my first day of 
the work search. I applied for 
the position ANLY DIGITAL ASSET 
PRODUCTION at 3M. do you want to be
where you are and how you have been doing it. 

and true that I don't have the qualifications 
that you are looking for but what's so amazing 
about really great qualifications.

615

I'm sure that I have the qualifications 
for this role, in fact, I'm sure that 
I can add more value to the company in 
this role than 15 asteroids of pure gold.

anyway.
I have to think.
I kind of like looking for work. 
I kind of like work prospecting.

I have to start looking for work.
What are my thoughts? Well, I put in my 
resignation at Amazon. My figuring is that: 
the company will probably return staffing 
levels, or head-counts, to pre-pandemic levels, 
like the newspaper says, so, in a way I'm saving 
someone else's position in the process. I think 
that if I hadn't resigned, I probably would have 
continued exploring the company.

616

I haven't been on a job hunt in a while.
Tired. Quite. Tired. I remember reading a while ago.
Never mind.
I'm fucking tired. I tried to 
delete my Plenty of Fish account, 
but it doesn't appear to be a possibility.

617

I left work about an hour and a half early.
I might be stuck in town.
I thought about. Someone. the other 
day. during one of these restless 
nights. and I just couldn't sleep.
I filed a copyright for my #putinpullout! series on Twitter

I wonder where the hell this came 
from and how it ended up in my current document.

Spam Stanzas

619

Asian beauties, Russian Beauties, and pills
   to enlarge your penis, a lottery
   check is waiting for you, and unpaid bills,
   and deals on ancient Chinese pottery.

A handful of rice and a slice of spam
   and a sheet of nori: wrap it around
   and you have spam musubi, then you cram
   it into your throat and swallow it down.

Spam is something that en masse you delete
   because everything caught by the filter
   is useless. Spam is something that you eat
   unless your stomach feels out of kilter.

Spam is a nuisance, and also a food
one is deleted, the other is stewed.

Every day there's a new barrage of text
   messages queued inside my SMS
   box telling me of all the greatest shit
that I need to know: Tesla's not indexed
   to the S&P 500, new sets
   of rockets where shot into space with kits

of Chinese terrariums filled with plants
   in an attempt to colonize the moon:
rice so good that caterpillars and ants
   have reallocated all their doubloons into

a new space rice rocket landing mobile
   and lunar rice paddy REIT's, while roaches 
   have a position on rice terraces
on Martian mountains and hope to double
   rice shipments with interstellar coaches
   powered by Lockheed and L3 Harris.

621

And then there are notifications from 
the webcam ladies on Pornhub asking
for another round of seed funding, some
kind of boob photograph monetizing

algorithm that basically turns boob
photographs into cryptocurrency
called titty coins that every single N00B
playing Call of Boobies can use to see

the exact location of the knocker
exposure device, which will debrassier
all the dudes and chicks with great boobs faster
than a mechanical hand. Yet, we fear

a high degree of illiquidity
for any cryptocoin based on titties.

622

The calls that come in from some random chick
from some far away place where call centers
dot the landscape and everyone is sick
from the COVID lockdown that our betters

have forced upon us. She keeps asking me
for donations for the starving lions
of the Kalahari Jungle, and pleads
for donations in cryptocoins, tying

the success of her crypto nonprofit
to the results of the latest death stats
issued by the local health department

my GMAT book arrived.

624

it turns out that I never 
retook the GMAT again. never.
I never got around to it. I never
did get around to doing it.

I wonder what would have happened if I 
retook the GMAT.

a house becomes a new thing that makes people

when people see what they did when people

How many people are dying this week?
   Fuck You! and pay me you dumb fucking mink!

632

I thoguht that you 
were resting but you 
were not resting and you were 
not sleeping or anything like that.
and you were doing all the things that 
were the worse of both world that were
the best of every world.

and tell me how you 
came to the conclusion that the best of all these are
not the best of everyone.

633

Countless messages from random ladies 
   on Instagram, most of them telling me
   how naughty their webcam streams on OnlyFans
are, the best positions and poses, these
   days, with modern cosmetic surgery,
   all the chicks are hella fine, pale or tan,

it doesn't matter, spray one on, or bleach 
   one off, there are coupons in your spam box
that you can economize with, and each
  tanning solon has TikTok whores galore,
     each and every one a big titty fox
  that I really want to make nice and sore.

I don't need tanning, I'm already bronze,
except for my Johnson and his bon-bons.

634

There were a few things 
that I was looking for.

635

What am I working on.
Yeah. I think that I'm done with the #putinpullout! series
especially considering that
i filed a copyright for it.
a best of all worlds.

636

and I don't want to 
work on it right now.

637

Is it true?
You are the aribol for the shorganda leebo?
no
I am not the shorganda Leebo? or the aribol for
the shorganda leebo, please do not
ask me that again, because

yesterday i was naked 
and I ate an entire bowl of the
frutiest peebbles in the
jornebromarri tola

638

here we go again. I told 
you over a thousand times
not to eat my punani, and yet 
you ate it anyway!

639

What. exactly. is  a  queef
and bean burrito?

well, it's kind of a dual fart. where
one fart exits the front door, and another
fart exits the rear door.

when i was in moscow the other 
mellenium. i went to st petersberg
square, and there
at the center of the square

was vladimeer purtin!

640

but the best of how
things go wrong 
is where it all goes crazy 
I figured it out. Figure out .
Think about what you wanny. 
Think about what you want. 
And that's what youll get.
Okay
Go take a nap!
Happy mother's day mom. I've been busy, so, I'm writing this a few days ahead.
Try to understand that I have time to do this now, and, I might have to work, 
at somepoint, in the future. So.
Alright mom. Since you won't stop nagging. I faked my death. I'm still alive. 
I didn't die on August 15th, 1987. I'm writing this to you on May 6th, 2022. 

641

Why did I fake my death? What was 
I supposed to do? Let you nag me to 
death? That kind of environment would 
have killed me. I probably would have 
died as a result.

I'm still having nightmares
I cant sleep.
This is a nightmare. A real nightmare.

Should.
how were they and how were 
things going? when they were good and when 
they got better.
What should I do?

Kenneth.
Thats just the air conditioner.
It's not the aliens!

Dont worry!

642

I cant sleep.
This is what I imagine
him saying is:
Lets play a game
Where i lose once,
And you lose once.

I'm actually kind of. Really doing well for myself.
And. I'm going to create intellectual property. Called. Poems.

You don't need to go to the hospital. This isn't a real problem.
Okay, it really isn't.
You just need a guidance consuler.

You don't need to go to the hospital. This isn't a real problem.

you are very rotten. I wouldn't.
I would not do that.

Some ideas for a working title?

These are a few of my idea. right now. i'm really tired..
my idea. don't worry too much about the imperfections
in your writing, like. let it come out however it comes it
and let someone else fight over the meaning, and
create.

that other stuff you are worrying about.

so here was the experience I had tonight. 
i realized, that. sometimes i'm such a loner, 
that. i feel like sometimes people want to help me, 
but i always want to be able to stand on my own two 
feet, to provide for myself.

and maybe that's not always the easiest thing to do.

it really is hard.

Kenneth.
So here is one thing

I took a nap
I took time off of work to nap during may the fourth, and cinco de mayo
althou

although the precision of that statement isn;'t entirely correct.
Here is my idea;
I would like to take a nap.
I'm at work early. I left work early the other day. I'm tired. 
I'm a monster. Or. I was. In many ways... I just need to get some rest. I'm so tired.
This is a nightmare.

669

S9 here.
So here is what I've concluded about Marxism.
I'm decic8ng.
I'm decieving myself.

I'm not part of the proletariat.
I'm actually kind of. Really doing well for myself.
And. im going to create intellectual property. Called. Poems. They're already called. That. Of course.

There is one other possible way to deal with this email thing. and. it's an approach that I really don't want to take. 
I want to do this the right way. You know. the way that is the longest and hardest way possible.

the easiest thing to do would be to have submissions@chestnutandhazel redirect to info@chestnutandhazel, rather 
than set up submissions@chestnutandhazel as a stand alone email. or i mean, setting up submissions@chestnutandhazel all on it's own.
alright let's see. I think that I did it.

670

There you do. I think that I did it.
So I guess at some point I'll have to upgrade the services I use for my pet project, known as Chestnut + Hazel.  
theres Google Workspace, AWS, and Microsoft 365 or Azure or something.
I haven't figured out what to do about this. I don't want to spend any more money on this than I'm currently spending.
and.

my domain doesn't expire for a while, so. I might not be in the market for an upgrade for about 10 years.
anyway. I have the submissions@chestnutandhazel.com email set up. so that's done. I guess I can go back to whatever I was doing.
What else? nothing else for right now. I'm at my apartment, enjoying Bushmills, the rest of the bottle. I kind of want to play a computer game.

I think that everything that I need to get done, is done. so. I'll goof off for what's left of the day.
I'm getting together my college application. This is the third fucking time I've done this. UNLV, UMKC, and now UTA. I have to go.
What's one challenge that I'm facing? Well, I hardly know anyone out here. I don't want to get in contact with anyone from before Arlington.
Maybe I can ask the land lady for a letter of recommendation.

I just don't know. This is a nightmare. I don't know anyone.
I'm sure that I'll need a letter of recommendation. 
I don't. fucking. know anyone. I haven't made any friends or connections. maybe my land lady can write one.
One problem. Is. Running out of money before I get this started, or before I can get student loans. The general consensus is that going to 
graduate school is less prudent than going to a trade school or vocational school, but I definitely can't seem to get into a vocational school. 
I tried 3 times and I just couldn't do it. I have no idea what the fuck to do. This is a nightmare. A real nightmare.

Thinking about the issues that I've faced in the past. I think. I had an opportunity to go to UMKC, there was a position at the Post Office in 
Kansas City, that I declined, because it would have been less, in total, than what I was making working at the Tractor Warehouse and the Hotel.
but I remember thinking, that, maybe not going to UNLV or UMKC worked out for the best. The COVID-19 Pandemic hit, and, had I attended either 
UMKC or UNLV, it just wouldn't have worked out, or, it would have been disrupted in a major way.
With expectations of a recession, it might make sense for me to go to college now, this might be the. I don't want to think that this will be the 
last time that I do this. Running out of money is the biggest concern, right now.

671

but I have enough, don't I?
there are tests that you can 
take to find out what an idiot you are

there are tests that you can take
to determine how idiotic you are 
and what an idiot you are and how 
silly you are so silly!

revanchist
similar
to vindictive or vengeful.
déclassé is similar to vulgar

Norfolk is pronounced like Knorr, the soy sauce, and fuck, like the sexual act.
Knorr-Fuck is sex. using soy sauce as a lubricant.
Ennui is listlessness? or boredom.

I'm tired. I hardly got anything done today. 
I went to the post office, and ended up goofing 
around in Downtown Arlington, Texas. It's already the 
morning, the day after. and I'm still kind of tired.

So this position would require relocation, but I already 
renewed my lease for 1 year, so, I don't know how this 
position would be feasible. I applied anyway since it 
was on my list of places to apply at.

For a building company, however, I would actually be 
interested in a sales role. Or. I think that this is a 
building materials company.

What am I thinking. I still have to figure out the whole school 
thing. Mainly just getting my transcripts. I don't know why I 
don't have copies of these already saved. nightmare.
I think that I may have had them on my previous laptop, or the 
laptop I had before my previous laptop.
Fucking tired. Heat fatigue. When it's hot, you'll fell tired. that's just how it goes.

I was reading, in a Thomson Reuters newsletter, about a desalination plant in 
California that was blocked by environmentalists, and one things that the 
environmental group pointed out is that, water recycling is much less expensive, 
less energy intensive, and less destructive to marine life. and, even if the 
desalination plant is stopped, i'm sure that it can be retooled as a water 
purification plant anyway. or something. i don't think of myself as an environmentalist, 
I just happen to find the argument that they made compelling.

673

I haven't used ebay 
since I was last in Las Vegas, 
meaning. Back in 2019.

674

and I only used it for one thing. to buy 
a console. a gaming console. and it was 
kind of a bad purchase.

I'm coming across a large number of tasks 
that are incredibly time consuming. It isn't 
always really easy to make friends, or catch up with 
family, or shoot the shit with random strangers. 
There's really just too much shit to do. There's 
really just too much fucking shit to do. People 
get made if you don't waste time, but there really 
isn't a hell of a lot of time to waste. Why don't we 
watch TV all day? Why don't we play computer games all 
day? Why don't we chat about politics and all this other 
shit? All fucking day? Well, for one thing: I have all kind 
of other shit that I need to do all fucking day. and if 
I'm going to waste time, I'm going to waste it the way I want to waste it.

675

It always annoys me when someone tells me that I look tired. I am 
tired. In fact: I'm really fucking tired. Those people who don't 
look tired, they have privilege: Round Eye Privilege. Privileged Round Eye Individuals.

I'm usually really fucking tired. Those people who don't look tired, 
they have privilege. Round Eye Privilege. Privileged Round Eye Individuals.

I remember not really using Twitter until recently. I used 
Facebook for the longest time. Switching over from platform 
to platform isn't really all that easy. and signing up for 
new ones is usually a nightmare. I just don't want to sign 
up for any more of these. where they have been and the tree.

676

Okay. All of my bills are paid up through the end of 
June. I start work at the end of May. I think I might 
be okay, even if I don't get anything from Unemployment. 
I just need to make sure that I start working. Okay, what 
else? Let's see. I really don't want to tap my investment 
accounts more than I really need to.

team into a verloren hoop charge at the Wehrmacht's

678

I remember some of these twitter posts
I don't know why I was using twitter or 
why I started using twitter back when I wrote these. 
I guess. Maybe I was excited about it about twitter.

679

I fought for the Allies at Stalingrad as part of the 
Fried Rice Auxiliaries of the Red Army, Ho Chi Minh 
and Emiliano Zapata were my Comrades in Arms, but the 
Soviets had logistical problems then, as now, and we 
were given only one rifle for the three of us.

The reason I'm not entirely in favor of student loan 
forgiveness is this: education expenses receive a tax credit, 
a portion of student loan payments are tax deductible, so anyone 
receiving student loan forgiveness is triple dipping at the tax-payer's expense.

681

well, now that I have student loans.
you can guess what side of the discussion 
I am now on.

682

One of the reasons I'm not entirely in favor of student 
loan forgiveness is that: qualified education expenses 
receive a tax credit, a portion of student loan payments 
are tax deductible, so anyone receiving student loan 
forgiveness is triple dipping at the tax-payer's expense.

If Vladimir Putin thinks he's going to win: he's got another thing coming! Anglozilla and Danezilla are coming for Sovietzilla!
Another reason is that many employers offer tuition and education reimbursement incentives. It's not really a huge indignity to 
bag groceries, or pour coffee, or pack boxes, or count cash.

Spam emails. Some of this stuff I probably would buy, but right now. 
I kind of have to relax on any additional spending. when I think about 
what could possibly go wrong over the next few months: it just kind of 
makes me want to be cautious. and then there are the pictures. of the
ladies not wearing clothes. Clothes are not fun. take them all off. remove.

Project Proposal:		To create a program that automatically creates
                                trading tickets for a security, for example, buy 
                                and sell orders for shares of an exchange traded fund.
                                
                                A user would only manually enter the first order, either to 
                                buy or sell a security, the program would populate and submit 
                                a new ticket based on the fulfillment of the previous ticket, 
                                the chain of tickets would continue until the user decided to
                                cancel the chain.
                                
                                Another application of this program would be to serve as a

I just completed the codewars version, and I'm coming back here to my leet code version, and it just. the solution I came up with seems 
so alien to me. there's so much stuff going on outside of the function. the two versions are different. obviously. but one. in one case. the 
leet code case, it's more for numbers, there's even a follow - up challenge where, they suggest trying to solve the same problem using 
some kind of mathematical formula. that's not something that can be done with words.

but the word version, the codewars you have to deal with upper and lower case letters, which is something that isn't a problem or 
something to be concerned about when working with numbers. in fact, when i realized. well, it wasn't the only problem, but one 
problem I was having was the to lower case part of the function. Anyway. I'm really glad that's over.

on to the haccker rank palindrome problem.

I just completed the codewars version, and I'm coming back here to my leet code version, and it just. the solution I came up with seems 
so alien to me. there's so much stuff going on outside of the function. the two versions are different. obviously. but one. in one case. the

Good Lord. I can't believe it finally worked.

712

If the Druidic Council approves reimbursement for 
Marijuana, I want to submit medical expense reports 
for medicinal blowjobs. You wouldn't believe how 
therapeutic blowjobs can be.

713

So I have an interview for a position tomorrow, and I'm actually 
kind of excited about it. The pay is in line with what I was making 
at Amazon, and sometimes I think: I'm probably more useful as a 
customer, than as an employee, although, I'm certain that I'm the 
most amazing employee of every company that I've ever worked at.

714

function isPalindrome(x) {
let reverse= x.split('').reverse().join('')
if (reverse.toLowerCase()==x.toLowerCase()){
return true;
}
else{
return false;
}
}

this looks the most like something I would have done, or 
the approach I would have taken, but it isn't clear to me 
why this works, and mine didn't

715

I don't know how overtime would work. 
I am serious about going back to college.

i'm annoyed that I'm having trouble with something 
as basic as this. annoyed. really annoyed.

i'm looking for something that looks like something 
i would have done, because, even if these solutions work,
it's not clear to me how they work. or why they work.

716

still slogging along on this trivial problem. part 2 is a calculator problem, and I'm really just 
not there yet. my idea is to convert the 4 function calculator into an options pricing calculator,
and it feels like doing this is an eternity away.

I really would like to go back to work. actually. I wouldn't mind collecting 
unemployment, but so far it has been a nightmare. the whole process. and. it's 
easier just to go back to work. they might not approve me anyway.

717

and, I guess in that vein, I guess I should no longer refer to 
my 7.5 inch Johnson as a form of currency, even though it is surely a 7.5 inch money maker!

718

I'm really tired. I've only gotten this far. the second problem out of the three.
I've been goofing off, but even goofing off is exhausting. I'm attending class, but 
I'm still working on Project 13. I'm actually just trying to figure out basic stuff.
I remember the leetcode version being for numbers, and this palindrome problem 
in codewars is more like the version I had in class, it deal with letters rather 
than numbers, a text string rather than a string of numbers.

719

I received a marketing email from Viator earlier today. I read it, 
but later marked it as spam and tossed it. i think that. part of the 
reason that I liked her was that. meeting her and working for her 
coincided with kind of a turning point in my life. i was homeless 
during my last year in San Jose, and i was struggling, and spending 
all my money. i don't have all bad memories of San Jose, and not 
everything was bad in las vegas, and things weren't really all that 
terrible in Missouri.

these are the things
that make the world sputter.

that other github account just. really isn't working. so. I guess I'll wait. I deleted all the other repositories, then
deleted the main repository, the created a new main respository for that account. and I'll wait to see if it publishes
to GitHub Pages. I tried deleting that account, but, to no avail.

I still haven't started on the testimonial,
and I more or less haven't started on Project 13, and
I honestly haven't been able to fall asleep.

I want to get some rest first, and then start
on Project 13, but I'm having a really hard time
falling asleep. I spent mountains of time on project 12,

but honestly, I really think that what I came up 
with was worth every minute of the hella-ton of hours
that I spent on it. I really love the customized responses.

720

This whole thing of a respository within a repository did not work. Remember this.
this is actually pretty cool. i set up my other repository as a directory 
with in my main repository.

"I WANT TO BE A WRITER!" in 
re "I WANT TO BE A WRITER!" by Ashley Frangipane (2020)

okay, so. sometimes
my poems are
corny or trite or pompous.

sometimes your poems
are slutty and bitchy.
give me a break.

722

I've come back around to project 14 to update the map links to 
leaflet, to give all the pages a customized location. project 14 
hasn't been graded yet, so I figured I would spend a little 
more time on it, plus, it is my project, and I want it to be 
interesting. I also Kind of need to get myself into work mode, 
since I've just been playing computer games for so many days, and 
not really doing anything else.

I'm almost done with this, and it was somewhat quicker than I 
thought that it would be, I actually have to redo a Professional 
Development Project, the last one. and I also still have to get back 
to project 15. Alright, so all the maps are done and updated for 
project 14, I don't think that it was necessary to do 20 different 
leaflet pages, but, I think it looks nice, plus I have a few
leaflet pages for the hamburgers project I did a while ago.

but, getting back to project 15. I think that I'm going to start with a 
few simple things that just use the CDN before I start using all those 
packages I installed. That's all done, project 14 
is done in a way that I like it. DONE!

This was not too exciting, boring, a few stuff using the React CDN, 
and all of this stuff is stuff from the React Website itself. I'm 
going to test out a few more CDN React things, and then try something
else with react. This should be really useful, when I think about my 
most recent update to the Chestnut + Hazel Connections project, I had 
to create 20 seperate Jennifer Connelly Pages, and 20 different Meet 
Me at our Spot pages, that's 40 pages that I had to create, and 
supposedly I wouldnt have to do that if I could set up create for that 
project.

723

Even with as much time as I've spent on this, and seemingly no closer to getting a JSON file working, I seem to have
made a breakthrough with this carousel. The iframes look like they are interactive in a way that they were not interactive
in the original Project 10 version of the carousel.

I'm setting up links to see if the iframes in the carousel work, and if they do, then that means this should work. and I can
get project 14 completed, even though this seems like it was kind of a long digression from the requirements of project 14.


One possible nightmare is that it might not be necessary for to really target huge population centers to create a lot of havoc, 
key logistical infrastructure, telecommunications infrastructure, energy and electricity infrastructure, food infrastructure and 
transport infrastructure. He doesn't have to create very many casualties to create a lot of collateral damage.

724

there isnt anyting else other than getting through the day.
Life is so f****** boring. But then. What else is there?
dont know why. Bored as s***.
these past few day have been s***. Or felt like s***.
im feeling sad for some reason.

This folder is where I will put any notes and course material related to our earlier javascript lessons. 
I really have to start from the beginning because there are so many things I just, either forgot, or didn't 
fully understand.

I was having nightmares of people in SWAT or Special Forces gear.

Adventure # 6 - 10/12/2023 20:47
I am exhausted. I have a meeting tomorrow regarding admission to UNLV. I have to figure this out. It's not
clear to me what we will be discussing. I don't know how many times I've sent transcripts and submitted
applications to UNLV, and all that.

729

I don't know what's on my mind exactly. I'm tired. Going back to work for those two weeks or whatever. It made
me realize that. I don't know. Like. Working in a factory or a warehouse is going to be just another dead end.
It's never really gone anywhere, and, as far as I can tell, it's not really going to go anywhere.

730

I remember going into one interview recently and, there was this kind of weird moment where, the interviewer
seemed to. Well, she stated that she was looking for someone who was looking to stay with the organization for
the next 20 years or something. and I was thinking. I was thinking later, but. do I really plan 20 years ahead?
do I have a 20 year plan? because I already know that I don't have a 20 year plan, but if I did have a 20 year plan
or, something. I sure as hell wouldn't be interviewing for your company.

731

you know.
if I have to plan for the next 20 years, the most obvious thing to do is not to work for some company that I don't
see myself working at for 20 years. you know. like I don't really see myself working there for 20 years, or even 2 years.

You know. There isn't a single company that I've ever worked for, or that I've ever applied for, that I really saw myself
working at for 20 years.

I mean the most obvious thing to do, if I'm planning for the next 20 years. is. to go back to college. develop some
new skill or whatever.

732

Adventure # 5 - 10/12/2023 02:48
So what am I thinking about right now. I got sidetracked from putting down my thoughts for Adventure # 4. Well.
I don't know. I tend to be bombarded with stuff. Various stuffs. Various things. This or that. Whatever. I started
obsessing over the color of the buttons on my landing page. made a little bit of progress. realized I don't know
jack about javascript. figured I'd get around to it later. and then I started 
obsessing over my project carousel. so that's basically what happened. I'm tying to recollect about what happend 
yesterday, and the things I'm thinking about for the next couple days. The forseeable future, which as of right now.
can be measured only. in days.

733

I got sidetracked yet again. I don't know where I was.
Quam pulchra es sicut ibi stabat Qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet consectetur 
ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem Quae te dementia cepit Forsan et 
haec olim meminisse juvabit Militat omnis amans  omnia vincit amor  

734

I got sidetracked yet again. The above text should read something like 
How beautiful you are standing there! who gullibly believes you are everything? 
who seeks pain to derive some pleasure from pain? What madness
posesses you? We will remember this fondly: every lover is a fighter: Love conquers all.
This is basically just a collage of different latin quotes. Famous ones. including the most famous latin text of all: 

lorem ipsum.
This is supposed to be funny. The most famous latin quote should be omnia vincit amor, love conquers all, but I don't think that it is, i mean, more
well known than lorem ipsum. the other funny thing is that, delorem ipsum, is from, i guess, cicero, but his most famous line should actually be:

Carthago delenda est
and um, I guess I came across: Militat omnis amans, from Ovid
which translates to:

every lover
is
a fighter

Which is really funny because that's clearly a response to the phrase: "I'm a lover not a fighter." 
and he does this to omnia vincent amore as well, where he say something like:

Love conquers all? so too will I triumph over love!
but I couldn't find that quote online, or at least, I had a lot of trouble finding it because all searches for
Omnia vincent amore, ovid come up only with virgils original line.
anyway.

735

I got sidetracked again, I had an ititial version of project 8 that I was having a lot of trouble with, so, I stopped working on it and
started completely over. There is a screenshot of it in my media folder. I don't know what the issue was. or. I don't remember since project 8
feels like it was something I did such a long time ago, but whatever it was. I think it was that I was having trouble changing things. so I started with
a different templete or whatever it's called in wordpress, and deleted more or less everything but the color scheme, and re-did the entire
thing element by element. so. that's how it went. super easy and I really enjoyed it.

I feel like there was something I'm supposed to do today, but, whatever it is, it's clearly slipped my mind.

Adventure # 4 - 10/11/2023 23:04
There are a number of things on my mind, but I'm not sure what to write about first.
I might be able to get into UNLV. I have no idea how many times I've applied there, and for how many
different programs, but finally getting in would be nice. I feel so bad about dropping out of grad school
at UTA a year ago, and, if I ever get around to making it up to Yibing Du and Thomas Thompson, I'll reapply 
at somepoint in the future and get a degree at UTA.
anyway.

I'm glad it's still, only Wednesday, even if, at 23:13, it's pretty much already Thursday. I have a metting with,
I don't know exactly, the admissions person, or, well, it's critical that I meet with him in order to get into the program.
I'm glad it's still Wednesday.

One of the issues I have with what I post on chestnutandhazel.com is that It's hosted, or whatever, it's really just an account
on blogger.com, so since it's basically a social media account, I have to comply with the community guidles of blogger.com, and
since I have adsense active on that page, I also have to comply with any adsense advertiser standards, so I have my hands tied 
in many respects. chestnutandhazel.com continues to get flagged over and over and over, and in many cases I don't really want to 
deal with it right away.

the other issue is that I also have to post what I write somewhere, so that I can use the standard copyright registration form,
rather than the unpublished copyright registration form, so, that's another issue. so you know, it's kind of whatever.

This is a photograph of a mixed media composition. I took two paintings that I bought by a local artist, put a Zoloft pen 
on top of the painting of Jack Torrance, and then took pictures of my masterpiece, and then photo edited the result. 
The paintings are by Vanessa Callanta. what stood out to me about Callanta's Painting "All Work and No Play" was how 
calm Jack Torrance looked. i think it's the use of blue. Jack Torrance typically wore red shirts in The Shining.

I'm more tired than ever. More than

I consider this published, even if it's unlikley anyone will come across this
or read it. There are times when I want to write things, but, less and less I feel
the desire to write them on chestnutandhazel.com I don't know what it is, but, I'm
starting to feel more "On Stage" when I write and post things there.

745

Maybe a few years back it seemed, it 
felt like there wasn't anyone really, you know
reading it.

746

I'm really feeling unhappy.

I need to be working on Project 11, but for some reason I'm just not really getting anything done.
I've managed to figure out where my Contact Form is. It's something that I haven't really messed with
in a while, but Project 11 entails messing with it. So. That's what I'm up to.

There's a lot of cleaning up that needs to be done with the index page of my Github Repository,
and a lot of that cleaning up, with the code, cleaning up the appearance of my code wouldn't
really change the outward appearance of my page. It would just make it easier to change things around
but, considering that the course is almost over, I'm not really sure how much it makes sense to really
do anything about it.

I really have to get Project 11 done. I was reviewing the recording of the class session, and
it looks easy, and, I remember it being easy when I was doing it. I don't remember, but I 
think that I napped through part of the class, and came back around to it later.

One of the things about the class is that, I'm much more open to distance learning, or online coursework, or virtual classrooms,
or whatever, now that I've done it, back in 2018 or 2019 I think that I was really skeptical about it, and
I kind of brushed off a recruiter for an online degree program, but um, I think that I'm more open to it now.

I tried to get the favicon to work on GitHub, but, I can't seem to figure it out, and, since it's not an assignment,
I really didn't pursue the thing past the point of absolute frustration.

The favicon is more vanity than any kind of practical kind of a thing. Like I don't have a practical reason for setting 
up the favicon on GitHub other than the desire to have one.

I'm exhausted, and I really haven't done anything for project 11 yet.
I want to take a nap, but, that's a little bit of a risk considering that it's due today.
and, I really have to get to it because, in all probability, it's something that can be done in an hour or two, at most.
I'm so tired. I want to get a soda.

747

I don't know what to do about CodePen. Migrating things to github is a small nightmare.

<!-- 10102023 0423 form input validation project 11 -->

<!-- 10102023 1008 I got sidetracked with a number of other things and I'm still working on this. -->

I'm feeling incredibly scatter brained. I have a project due for my software and web development course today, and I haven't even started. 
This should be simple, so I'm not too worried about it, but, at the same time, I know from the past that these things could take quite 
a while if I hit a brick wall.

There are other issues that I'm facing, especially on the income front. The temp assignment was not a particularly good fit, and, I 
really get the feeling that I should avoid any kind of warehouse or factory work, even though, that's sort of what I've been doing 
for the past five years, but I don't have the slightest clue what to look for.

Life is such an unbelievable struggle. I don't really know what to do about money. Somewhere in the back of my mind there's 
this voice telling me that I should stop looking for a job or employment or whatever, and, that I should focus on trying to 
make money doing stock market shit.

Reflection # 714 by Chestnut and Hazel
I don't know exactly what I've been spending on buying lunch and soda at work, 
but I know that it is too damn much, I want to say it is around 15 dollars per day. 
Too fucking much. I have to cut down on that for sure.
By Chestnut + Hazel at June 11, 2019 
Notes written on 10/10/2023 @ 10:19 AM

I think that I wrote this post while I was working at Case New Holland. I'm surprised that I was really spending that much. I 
Wonder what I was buying? I don't really remember. I think that it was mostly energy drinks. I don't remember my exact hours. 
It was overnight is as much as I remember. In Cameron, MO there isn't really much to eat if you're up at odd hours.

I'm working on Project 11 for my Web and Software Development course. I'm not really getting much done. I'm getting sidetracked
with other things. I'm really amazed that I get so little done, especially considering that I've had few other obligations other
than class these past few months. I really wonder what I've been doing.

Earlier in the course I would have a lot of fun playing around with our daily assignments, but, I haven't really done that in a
while, even though there have been plenty of opportunities to do so.

"Clothes 28" by Kenneth Larot Yamat By Chestnut ﹠ Hazel 
at January 19, 2019 originally posted at chestnutandhazel.com
I watched two documentaries.
One on the Sino Japanese war.
The one that morphed into world
War 2. And one on the Japanese
Industrial revolution.

So. I wanted to think about why
Things ended at the OTA. It's been
A while. And I think. Deserves some
Reflection.

Lets say that all decisions can be
Simplified. That all decisions
Come to a fork. Bifurcate or
Whatever. Like. You are faced
With a decision. And your choices
Are always two. At first.

Think of this. In a standard road.
You have two choices when you
Reach an intersection. You can
Continue down the road. Or turn.
Two choices. If you choose to
Turn. You can choose left or right.
Two choices. And so on. Some
Might think of this as three choices.
You can travel straight. Left. Or right.
But you can also think of it the way
I did. Of two choices. One choice
Having two sub choices.

750

Which way of thinking is more
Simple? Which way of thinking is
Less convoluted? Which way of
Thinking is cleaner. I have no idea.
But I think. That bifurcation allows
Points in the decision making
Process to be more clearly marked.
And either way. You can still account
For all possible decisions.

So back to my former boss at the
OTA. She could have extended me.
Or she could have decided not to
Extend me. We already know what
Decision she made. But let's figure
Out what she was thinking.

Now. It didn't bother me that I wasn't
Formally employed by the OTA.
Who cares right? Some people do
Though. Some people do like to
Be official or whatever.

And I'm not being dismissive
About the desire to be official.
I wanted to be official with Ash.
But she didn't want to be official
Unless we were super fucking
Official.

751

In my thinking though. Even when a
Person is formally employed. Their
Continued employment is really
Just an extension. It just goes by
A different term. People think of
It differently. But I don't. People
Think of it differently because
Different words are used. But I'd say
The mechanics of being a contractor
On an extension basis. And being
A formal employee whose
Performance is measured at
Regular intervals. It's the same
Thing. If you aren't handed a pink
Slip when you show up for work.
You have been extended. Haha.

So she could have extended me.
Or not extended me. If she extended
Me. I don't know what would
Happen. Would she have to buy
My contract from the staffing
Agency? And pay some kind
Of a premium to do so? I have no
Idea.

752

I don't know what the extension
Decisions would be. If she would
Have been forced to decide whether
Or not to keep me on a contract
Basis indefinitely. Or decide to
Make me a formal employee of the
OTA. I have no idea. Really no idea.

And maybe that is where the issue
Arose. Maybe the issue was that
She had to decide whether or not
To formalize my employment or
Not. She may have wanted to
Extend. But could not formalize
My employment for whatever
Reason. And maybe formalizing
Was the only way to extend.

So basically. Maybe she wanted to
Extend. But not formalize. Since
She could not extend without
Formalizing. She therefore could
Not extend. So she decided not
To extend. And maybe that was it.

I think of the invention of

based on the most recent
thing that we came across we
decided that the best thing to do was to see where it all was.

I know what to do now, like going forward and stuff. I'm going to say this:

757

"Yeah, I know a whole bunch of stuff, all the craziest dirt and everything. Basically. 
I have all the information you need, even the things that other people don't know, and even the things that other people couldn't even imagine."

maybe you know the things that you haven't
already learned so you will learn them.

have you told anyone else how much I am your favorite

Like, Vladimir Putin might just target off-shore drilling sites 
and pipeline infrastructure, and he might not use armaments to do so. 
He might not use conventional weapons. Consider that his background 
before entering politics was working for the Russian intelligence 
agency. He might just send in saboteurs to wreak havoc.

760

Other nightmares. Well
I had this thought that Vladimir Putin 
was behind the violence in Buffalo, NY
and the reason being is that
he did mention Nukes over New York City,
and 
Vladimir Putin might just be using the word
Nukes
to mean 
Weapons of Mass Destruction
and
I was thinking that the violence in Buffalo, NY
could spiral into mass civil unrest
and I think that
mass civil unrest
is a kind of
Weapon of Mass Destruction.
fomenting unrest
and
inciting a revolt 
are tools that he might be attempting to use

indefinite hiatus day 1
sometimes it's real or isn't real. i think that for this series, 
i'm going to type in all lowercase letters. this is the first day of my indefinite hiatus.
i don't ever want to be reminded of this again and I have no idea why these posts.
are here. did I do that?

today was a kind of a normal day i guess. i'm tired. sometimes 
i need to smoke, and i go outside, and someone is always there. or 
arrives shortly after i arrive. what is the hiatus? i think that a 
hiatus is when something is delayed. // are where they think they are 
whatever i'm waiting for. i still seem to be waiting for it.
i also have to remember to buy sneakers. i already have shoes and boots, 
but i think that i have boots that would actually meet the specifications 
listed in the job description, so i may be able to wear those if my boots 
don't arrive. i might need to start shopping now actually.
or, to put it another way, i may need to actually start shopping now.

764

i'm super tired. what i think is. it's getting hot again. 
i think i need to just stay inside. i think it's the actual 
sun that is actually burning me right now. so tired.

765

I did think about her the other day. but. I didn't want to. I don't.
I really don't know what to think.
I don't know what to say.
Sometimes I wonder.
I don't know. I'm still unhappy about a lot of things.

766

The vape pen has been
smoking because I have been

I don't know. One thing about the Buffalo, New York incident is that 
this might spill over into something similar to the civil unrest during the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the riots and the insurrections.
This could end up being a nightmare. I'm afraid. I don't know. I was
hoping that things would get better, but who knows.

768

I'm stressed out. I feel like things
are more difficult than they should be.
as though. as though the universe 
is fucking with me, and i'm really 
fucking unhappy about it.

New sheet 
of paper.

There is a networking event 
on campus today, and I really 
don't want to go. It's not mandatory, 
but. I want to go, but I also really
don't want to go.

nothing is really going right for me 
right now and I'm really not.

I really don't enjoy interacting with 
other people unless I have something 
positive to say, and have good things 
or pleasant things to talk about.

779

I just finished reading I would leave me If I Could: a collection of poetry / Halsey, Ashley Frangipane (2020).
There were times when I wanted to throw that book against the wall, but, I didn't, and there were plenty of times where I really enjoyed her poems.
Some of the poems reminded me of. some of the def jam poetry sessions that i remember reading when i was in my early 20s.
i bought a hardcover copy because i don't remember there being a paperback version available.

780

college. unemployment. social security disability. and work. these. are the things that i kind of have to focus on 
right now. my head is killing me. i slept most of the other day. and. by the time i woke up. it was 400 PM or something. 
and there was really nothing much that i was able to get done.

781

I think that it would be nice if some of Halsey's lyrics were 
included in another book of poems, or her next book of poems or whatever.

I have not been 
looking for an employer

What else do I have to do? my head is pounding. 
I want to read violet bent backwards over the grass.

I added a few items to my wish list, but, then 
i realized that i was getting carried away. so . I'll leave it alone for now.

i know that you have been copying my shit
and not giving me a single attribution.
not that any attributions are required

that i will get over this for a while.

Greetings University of Texas at Arlington:

I’ve decided to pursue an education at the University of Texas at Arlington 
due to the location of the institution: it’s within walking distance of my 
current residence, and at the center of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Area. 
This is the third educational institution that I’ve attempted to pursue and obtain 
an advanced degree from, having previously applied to the University of Nevada at 
Las Vegas, and the University of Missouri at Kansas City. I was accepted to both 
institutions, however, due to distractions of one variety or another: financial, 
romantic, or professional, or even some infernal combination of all three; I found 
myself unable to attend either institution.

What I aspire to, from an educational and academic standpoint, is to be accepted 
into the Quantitative Finance, M.S. program at the University of Texas at Arlington, 
complete the program, get a master’s degree, write numerous profound academic treatises 
and scholarly articles, submit them to academic journals, and win the greatest awards 
and recognitions for everything that I do. I want the papers I write to be cited by 
all other academics in Finance and Economics and even by academics in Personal Finance 
and Home Economics.

There hasn’t been much reflection on my part as to what I intend to accomplish and achieve 
professionally after graduating from the Quantitative Finance, M.S. program offered by the 
University of Texas at Arlington. Pecuniary interests have never been the primary focus in 
my life or in my professional pursuits, however, I’m absolutely certain that all of the 
most amazing doors in the Universe will open as soon as I graduate from the program.

Sincerely,

Kenneth Larot Yamat

she has this fragrance of a mix between

these are where you
are and you
are here and when 
you went somewhere
else you took everything
I thought you 
were in possession of.

hear the sound
of when
you are
here and when
the sound of how you
spoke and how you 
smell when
you talk about how good
it is and how you
smell when you are
sweaty from activities

that are more 
interesting in the

I'm a little bit 
frustrated right now.

What I'm frustrated with right 
now, is that there is an 
application fee. and shit. 
there's just a bunch of stuff 
right now that's fucking irritating. 
nightmare.

what the hell do I need?
and i also took a photograph of my cigar. 
now. i didn't snort a single gram of the 
tobacco smoke, nor did I inhale. at 
least not in the last ten years or so.

I don't enjoy reading Hustler Magazine, 
I much rather peruse Hustler Magazine,

Larry Flynt.

I fact: I consider it a travesty and desecration to the sacred 
act of making facetious remarks, a power and privilege that all 
of us are endowed by our creator. or whatever. uh. not to codify 
the facetious remarks amendment to the constitution of the 
united north americans

When there are hard times, there continue to be hard times, and 
there will always be things that you don't need to do and there 
will be things that make you unhappy where you will be where things
that are not nice and when you are unhappy there are things needed.

806

so what do i do next?
i have to stay off twitter for a while. it's a major time and energy drain. 
i really. i really only spend time reading my own tweets over and over again.
that's really the only 
part of
twitter that I really enjoy.

807

I'll put in one application per day.
there's some issue where I have to contact 
the Texas Workforce Commission. or go to 
their office or something?

still tired. or kind of tired. 
This guy at the pizzeria was being 
a dick. so I left. but that's more 
or less all i did today.

think about micro-aggressions. micro-hostilities. 
small indignities. hate crimes. tribal wars. 
race wars. ethnic cleansings. and genocides.

I think that they are all part of the 
same spectrum of issues. they are all 
part of a failure to be polite, tactful, 
and diplomatic.

808

one issue in a multi-cultural. pluralistic. 
inclusive. and tolerant society is that it's 
hard to figure out what's polite. and what's 
offensive. there are always going to be mis-understandings.

the idea is to de-escalate. brinkmanship is a nightmare.
some people get a kick out of it. in this business community. the political community. on the global stage. whatever. you know.
the think about. a lot of the demagoguery that's going on in politics is that. i don't know. i just might end up in bad places.

anyway. it's just so fucking hot.
This is kind of cool, I found a kind of cool position.

One of the reasons that I only ever apply to positions 
on the S&P 500 list is that I've had trouble with 
companies and employers that aren't major companies.

809


The assembler position is close to were I live. So that's nice.
I guess. the next place that I'll apply is
I really feel bad when. There are calls for donations. or 
solicitations for donations, and I really don't have any money.
I have money, however. I just really can't spend any money.

810

I'm usually really fucking tired. 
Those people who don't look tired, 
they have privilege. Round Eye Privilege. 
Privileged Round Eye Individuals.

I remember not really using Twitter until 
recently. I used Facebook for the longest 
time. Switching over from platform to 
platform isn't really all that easy. and 
signing up for new ones is usually a nightmare. 
I just don't want to sign up for any more of these.

Okay. All of my bills are paid up through the 
end of June. I start work at the end of May. 
I think I might be okay, even if I don't get 
anything from Unemployment. I just need to 
make sure that I start working. Okay, what 
else? Let's see. I really don't want to tap 
my investment accounts more than I really need to.

team into a verloren hoop charge at the Wehrmacht's

I fought for the Allies at Stalingrad as part of 
the Fried Rice Auxiliaries of the Red Army, Ho Chi 
Minh and Emiliano Zapata were my Comrades in Arms, 
but the Soviets had logistical problems then, as 
now, and we were given only one rifle for the three of us.

The reason I'm not entirely in favor of student loan

Spam emails. Some of this stuff I probably would buy, 
but right now. I kind of have to relax on any 
additional spending. when I think about what could 
possibly go wrong over the next few months: it just 
kind of makes me want to be cautious.

I am not doing OKAY right now. I am not doing well 
right now. Things are not going right at the 
moment, and everything is not going right. this is

but then I would also have to donate to. I

Anyway. I think I've taken care of the stuff for my 
Unemployment Claim. I think that I went over this 
before. I'm not sure if my claim would be approved, 
since I resigned for personal reasons. Part of the 
reason I filed for unemployment is because I'm unemployed, 
and, I believe that it's important to be part of the tally 
of the unemployed. I think of filing an Unemployment Claim 
as similar to participating in the Census, or Voting, or 
filing a Tax Return. The Unemployment Numbers are an important 
metric that decision makers use when deciding where and how to 
employ capital, if they are investors, or where and how to employ 
economic stimulus, if they are politicians or bureaucrats, or 
where and how to employ philanthropic efforts, if they are philanthropists. 

where everyone sees what the end 
of the story is and what the thing 
is where the things goes into the best 
of the worst where the things are the
test and how you can see where the best 
where they are and how they do what they 
see and how they cannot be the worst of the
test of them all and how they can be where.

823

Anyway. What else do I have to do? Other 
college stuff, I think. I mean. College 
application stuff. I'm really fucking tired 
all the time. and I'm really. I really get 
distracted with other stuff too.

824

when the end of everything starts the 
beginning of everything and how these 
are the latest of where they are and 
they can be better than whatever they 
were before and newer and more novel.

Okay: Twitter Blue or Twitter for 
Professionals? Here's the thing: there

how is a factious remarks focused account

point have I crossed the line?

I'm really tired. I napped for a few hours, but I didn't get any actual sleep.
I have some unrelated good news. I don't have to enroll in. I don't have to
worry about enrolling in classes at UNLV until late november,

this means i can just focus on the stuff i already had going on
the software development class ends mid november. so i'll have some time to 
loaf around or something. well, even if. the spring semester at UNLV wouldn't start until 
next year. i think. so i would still have december to loaf around. 

assuming i'm still unemployed.
I'm tired and I really don't know where to start
Project 12 beat me to death, and Project 13 is already due tomorrow.

<p> I'm exhausted right now. I think I slept all of Sunday, and, most of Monday. Today is Monday, and I slept through most of it. I did watch a few 
movies: Donnie Darko (2001), Pi (1998), and Dances with Wolves (1990). I have a few class assignments to work on. Project 13 is done. It required 2-3 
problems to be worked on, and I did 2, LeetCode and CodeWars, I would like to work on a HackerRank problems, but, since it's not part of Project 
13's requirements, it's basically a personal project at this point, and it's the same sort of situation with converting the calculator project 
into an options pricing calculator, it's not required, so it's a personal project if I decide to pursue it. [were when you said that things were]
[great and nice and cold and heads will be] 0 [there was something] </p> [there were interesting things that were amazing that were neat that were]

[get more of the best things and more the thing] <p> [that were more and more] [ and never and never and when and never and how and never and this ]
I'm really tired. I haven't done much today, other than play on the computer. I need to get my assignments done, I don't think there is anything 
else I have to do for Project 13. I have to look into project 14. [ put off for now what you think is the wrong ] [ thing of the best ideas that can't]

This is still 
to me still 
it's still a work of poetry.

873

I would still say that this is 
primarily a work of poetry this is a poem.

[I would still say that this is a work of poetry] <p>...</p>
[I would classify this as a poem] <p class= "adventuretitle" >
Adventure # 34 - 10/29/2023 02:41 </p> [I would insist that this]

[is a work of poetry] <p> I don't know what to do right now. I'm really thirsty, 
and I want to go out and get a few sodas. but, [that this was the poem the latest]
I also don't want to go out right now, this early in [one that I was working on]

the morning. I kind of just want to stay home right now, but, I'm really thirsty. 
I was playing Rome Total War 2, and, I was attacked by another 
faction, and, at the time I just really didn't want to fight that particular battle, 
so I signed out and went back [I would still say that this is a work of poetry]
to working on class work. but, I'm also not really in the mood to do any classwork 
right now. Today is Sunday, but I still have [this was what i was working on]
things that I have to get done, even if the urgency is slightly less than it 
would otherwise be.

874

what do I have to do? [but it could potentially create huge problems later massive issues]
[what can you do where can you be] </p> [ this is where it was all going to be ] 
[ where everything is really unhappy ] [what they find is that making happiness]
<p>I did a little bit of work on chestnutandhazel.com trying to fix a few things here and there, but 
it takes a long time. trying to fix things. I had to deal with a small disaster. basically, i cloned a 
GitHub Repository to my main repository, creating a repository that is both a repository, and a directory 
within a repository. It created problems. Don't do it. I thought it would make things easier, but it didn't.

it's a mess. Anyway. that was a small disaster. My miscellaneous 
repository, the one where I have project 13, seems fine,  
but there were uncommitted  changes in my main repository that 
couldn't be committed  and pushed, so I have no idea if I lost anything 
or not. [ these were where they were all at where things went and broke them down]
[how do you make new things happier than they were] </p> [you can be happy and still new]

<p> but for reference, the way i solved the problem was this: i couldn't push the 
changes to GitHub because the file was too large, and 
took too long to upload, and it exceeded the allowable file size, so I basically 
had to delete the local files, restart my computer [poem]
because several of the files were in use by my computer, remove the repositories 
from GitHub Desktop and VS Code, and then pull and fetch the repositories from 
GitHub again. oh, and i also had to delete the offending file, the 
huge file that was too large to deal with, directly from GitHub. 

there seems to have been a way to remove the file from my committed  
changes, before pushing, but, i deleted the file locally before i could do 
that, so [were all talking to eachother about this still being an amazing]
for some reason i couldn't remove it from my list of committed  
changes to push. anyway. I think it's more or less resolved at this point.
[I would say yes!] </p> [and how they were all amazing where they were all amazing where they]

<p> Sometimes I wonder why I never seem to have enough time, or enough energy to do things, and 
well. part of the reason is that I spend a lot of time doing things that don't really accomplish anything.
    
I spent some time trying to fix an older GitHub account: KennethLarotYamat-as-chestnutandhazel <br> <br>and it just still doesn't 
seem to be working. I remember when I first set it up, and, i remember following the instructions over and over and nothing 
seemed to happen. <br><br> i thought that, now, since I have more experience with GitHub, I could come back around to it and fix it, but 
well, no such luck. as far as I can tell, it's still broken. <br><br> i'll worry about it later. I really can't believe it is already 
the 27th. I'm about to go on 4 months without any income.

<p> I spent some time napping, but not getting any actual sleep, the time is 05:44 AM</p>

876

there was an on-campus event today, it started earlier,
but I don't know. I wanted to go, but I also really did 
not want to go. I don't really have anything good to say.

what would I say? everything is a disaster? nothing is 
going right? I think. well. It's a disaster. nothing is
going right. nothing is working out. everything is falling
apart. noting is going right. nothing is going right.

<p>I need to see how this works. I set it up so that the triggering order is cancelled at the end of the day if it isn't filled. If the triggering order 

is cancelled, the untriggered order should also be cancelled, but, if the triggering order is filled, the triggered order should stay open until cancelled. 
I'm entering this order to make sure that this is how it works.
[but I think] </p>
<p>...</p><p class= "adventuretitle" >Adventure # 30 - 10/26/2023 07:50</p>
[that things often go wrong] <p>

880

I cancelled all open orders and put a new set of orders in. I have to start paying more attention to this again. I think I have, not a new approach, but an adjustment
in mind. I don't want to have too many orders open at any given time. So I'm thinking that I have to adjust and merge orders as I go along. One issue that
I'm facing right now is that I don't have very much cash to work with. With the T + 2 settlement restrictions that I'm facing, I can really only
trade a third of my cash on any given day, and I kind of tied up a lot of it writing that cash secured put option. The idea was that I could collect interest on
the cash collateral, in addition to collecting the premium for writing the put option as well as getting 100 shares into SPLG for less than 49.90. I'll see how this goes, 
the put option has a November 17 expiration date.

881

<p>...</p> [ they might be, more exciting than they were, more amazing than they were, more amazing than they were]
<P>I was thinking, what if instead of writing a put option, I bought a call option instead, well, doing that would only accomplish 1 out of the 3 targets I had in place 

sure, I could collect interest on the cash, but I would be paying a premium of 380 buying a 49 strike call, rather than collecting a premium of 
60 on a 50 strike put, I also wouldn't 
be getting into SPLG for less than 49.90. I would also currently be facing a much larger unrealized loss than the already somewhat large 
unrealized loss I'm currently facing.

I cancelled all of my outstanding orders, the ones that weren't

all the outstanding orders I have, or had. before I cancelled 
them, they were all sell orders. I don't really want to be dealing with what I was dealing with 
earlier, you know, only in the opposite direction: having, 
on any given day, a whole bunch of sell orders go through without any corresponding buy orders go through.

isn't video content, but audio content, documentaries audiobooks and podcasts, i've always kept the resoultion low, not wanting to waste the badwidth. </p> <p>...</p>
[you can't do things like eat more than will fit inside your stomach]
<p>My screen recording isn't working again. This usually happens when a video is being uploaded to YouTube and is being processed. Anyway. I haven't checked 
in a while, but the last time I checked into it, I remember that in order to monetize videos on YouTube, your channel has to reach a certain threshold in terms 
of views, viewers, and view time, before being able to monetize. I think that I'll eventually add narrations.
[it simply cannot be done! you cannot eat more than will fit inside]

but there were times 
when thing were worse than 
they are right now 
times when thigngs were
even more terrible!

[I don't want things to get] <p> I don't know. It still seems. Well, I don't see any reason to change it right now. anyway. 
what else do I need to do. I've essentially [any worse than they could already be they are as horrible as they could be!]
been doing nothing but gaming since. Saturday Morning. I feel like only doing as much as I absolutely need to, and then going back to my game.
Do I have any life updates? well. My vehicle registration renewal sticker came in the mail, and I put it on my license plate.
maybe when things were more terrible they were even going to get even better </p> but really: who knows! they could have gotten worse! 

<p> What am I thinking right now? I realized I made a few errors while calculating my estimates. I made a few really basic errors. 
Hella dumb. for my estimate for SPLG for 10/20, for example. [Seriously!]
[and there are nothing - there are no things that are worse than what the were suspected to be]
I took the midpoint and subtracted the range from the midpoint to estimate the low and added it to the midpoint to estimate the high. No wonder I didn't have
any sell orders for that day.
there was nothing else when there were nothing there was nothing that couldn't be done while it was even worse! </p> so much worse!

[frustrated right now really frustrated right now.] <p> Anyway: what's the minimum amount of stuff I need to get done today? </p>
<p> ... </p><p class= "adventuretitle" >Adventure # 24 - 10/22/2023 07:49 </p>
<p> This is funny. Right on the dot. I've been playing Rome Total War 2 since. Well, almost 12 hours straight. There are actually
a few other things that I need to be working on. but, this is interesting. I really don't play computer games anymore or. all that much 
anymore, but a few months ago I started playing again, and, it's really been eating up a lot of my time. I made a hell of a lot of videos these past 
few hours, in fact. I pushed out publish dates into late December, releasing 1 video every three days. My screen recorder isn't working right now. So I'm taking 
this time to get some writing done.

<p>[sometimes the meeting cannot take place!]
The other day. When I was completing paperwork for UNLV, one of the attestations for recieving in-state tuition rates was declaring that I intend to make Nevada
my permanent residence. It was a hard question for me because. Whether or not I intend to stay in Nevada is contingent upon whether or not I'm able to attend 
college here. To me this was one of those chicken and egg problems. The other issue that made it a difficult question to answer is that. I kind of have 
to stay here. Even if I could leave. I kind of have to stay here. I really don't have any other choice. I really don't know what to do. Not that there is 
really anything I can do. 
[it is true, you know it really is true!] </p>

[but where were they when they said what they said] <p>...</p> <p class= "adventuretitle" >Adventure # 21 - 10/20/2023 21:51</p>

<p>...</p><p class= "adventuretitle" >Adventure # 20 - 10/20/2023 18:44 </p>[all these other things that were west of the]

<p> Okay, so there's that. Um, so the day in review.  I realized I made a mistake here, on my "Estimate for 10/20" um, the low should be
an estimate of 49.72. I put in 1 trade for 10 shares. Sell at the estimated high and buy at the estimated low, but I didn't put in 
a reverse order as well, because at this point I have way many shares than I can comfortably function with. I don't know why I was targeting
400 shares. I think that I was carrying that figure forward from. you know. when I was employed. and had a paycheck.
</p> <p>I think as some point I came to the conclusion that I it would be best to keep my position at around 200 shares, but didn't really

adjust everything, like, my outstanding orders and all that. I sold 5 and bought 83, or, I had sell orders for 5 shares filled, 
and buy orders totaling 83 shares filled. this is in addition to writing a put option which, at this point, is basically like having
bought an additional 100 shares, for a total of 183.
[were they even where they needed to be] </p> [and did they say anything that we could discover?]
[did they say something interesting] <p> [something that was useful in some way]     

anyway. I don't know what to do about. Javascript. and my OHLC estimator. I think that I spent so much time 
just trying to make it draw. that. well. like. and the drawing part. the visual part of it. is probably the least useful aspect of the 
thing. I have a project due tomorrow. One issue that I'm having is that I really don't have all that much energy, except on those days 
where I'm consuming an elevated amount of caffeine.

[] things could have gone well, they could have been amazing they could have been nice <p> [but that was not the way they worked out]
The order that says: <i>Sell to Open ... Put</i>, is an attempt to enter SPLG, 100 shares at 49.90, but more specifically, it's the closing
transaction of an OTO pair where, I think I sold those shares at 50.20. I did it as a <i>sell to open 1 put option</i>, rather than a 
[] some of how they went was less than where they were [] <i>limit buy 100 shares </i> [] you told me that it was all my fault and that
because there is something I'm trying to see. I wouldn't ordinarily do it this way, but, like I said, there is something I'm trying to see. 
and there are a few reasons why I'm not too worried: <ul><li>I want those shares at 49.90 anyway because they're part of a closing transation</li>

[] I am responsible for the failures of everything, but it was not my fault. 
at least, not in my opinion. I think that [you are the one responsible, and you are the one]
[who did all the wrong things and that you are the one who made all the mistakes and you are the one who fucked everything up]
<li>The expiration date is 2 days out, so, I'm not locked in to the contract for a nightmarishly long time
<li>Plus, there is something I'm trying to see</li>
</li> [you fucked everything up, but primarly for your own self that's what it was] </ul>
[if it turned out that things were not so amazing then] </p> [maybe it was not the way we thought it would go]

[there was something useless in the water] <p>What else: I had 19 buy orders filled, and no sell orders filled.</p>

<p>I think that most of these buy orders are closing transactions to sell orders. In the grand scheme of things,
SPLG is a long term position for me, and I'm only day trading a handful of shares at any given time. [not amazing!]

[but there was an amazing thing] <p>Anyway, in all honestly, in some ways. I'd rather just be working right now, 
and mindlessly buying in with all the money from my [you could say that this was. well. it was not amazing it was]

and, well -- you know what else I saw?
I saw a number of other very interesting things.
things that would interest an interested person.

<p>so I used a table. I know that I should be using a flex box or something.</p>
<p>Anyway. I don't know how to describe this the correct terminology, but I'm going to stagger my orders outside of the range by 5 cents.

<br>so: <br><br>50.74 - 50.95
<br>50.69 - 51.00

[they would be interesting to someone who was interested]
[but potentially boring to someone who was indifferent, or even, disinterested]

[Everything is one-size-fits-all] [it seems to be]
<br><br>woah. I almost made a mistake there. 
[just the way it goes it's just the way it goes it is one size fits all]

<br>49.92 - 51.24
<br>49.87 - 51.29
[and everyone has all the same stuff and all the same stuff and all of the same]

917

[well that's the way it goes] 12 I'm failing MIS 768. as in. I'm getting an F. I will have to audit
the course. an F is something that could take years to recover from
GPA wise. and when I mean recover, I simply mean having a GPA at a 
minimum acceptable level. a B average.

I really have no choice. I have to audit the course.
I also. have to file a patent.
and. yet again.
I. really. have no choice in the matter.

I think. one of the things that got me the
most interested in filing patents was. when I read
an article about the vanguard patent for the VTI ETF
being close to expiring. This was back in Missouri
when I was working at the hotel. I guess I finally
came around, four years later, to taking a detailed
look at the patent.

when I looked at the Vanguard VTI ETF patent, one thing
that immediately caught my eye was the section about the
patent application itself being under copyright protection,
and, when looking at other patent application files, not all
of them have that.
so I think.

I think I would file a copyright for the application material in
the patent application before submitting the patent application

918

[but there was something else] 11 . [hidden inside the place] . [where the 
people were] . I don't know how that last assignment went. It worked, I wanted to
spend more time with the comments, but I was one minute away from
the due date, and I had to just turn in what I had. I didn't even
want to really mess around with the code. I don't think that there 
was anything else for me to do. There was something that I wanted to
do. Oh, it was to remove the resource leak warnings, I remember, they
weren't errors, just warnings from the IDE that I usually do something
about, but I figured I didn't want to risk messing anything up.

919

[it was something new] . something interesting 
[a kind of orange inside of a lemon] . [an egg inside
of another egg] . [it was something new where the old things became new] 

920

[how they were] 10 what a nightmare! i just finished my last class exercise 
of week 5 [well. I am failing MIS 768 and it seems that is the way it's going]
and it took me 8 hours to complete. and i still have an individual
assignment due, and usually these are more complex. I don't even
want to imagine how many millions of years this individual assignment
is going to take, and, I still think that I'm going to be behind.
I don't even want to think about how many millions of billions and
eternities this assignment is going to take.

921

When I first signed up for this class, I think that I wanted to
eventually convert some of whatever Java assignments I anticipated
completing into JavaScript files, and then displaying them here
on my landing page, but I just haven't come around to doing that.

from readme.md entry # 8
So today I learned that I actually can edit .md files in
Eclipse. I have to use a - there is something called a generic 
text editor. I'm writing this in eclipse.

922

So basically, I moved the location of my local GitHub repository. 
I moved it from my lap-top hard drive to my
external hard drive.

923

So this update is being written in Eclipse, I had to change
the readme file from a .md to a .txt. It might be possible
to edit a .md file in eclipse, but for whatever reason, it wasn't 
readily apparent to me how to do so.

924

For whatever reason I can't edit a .md file in eclipse.

925

I moved the location where I keep my local GitHub files. 
I'm going to commit this and see if this worked out.

926

I'm really tired right now.
[how many times have I told you]
[not to eat oranges without me > + ? ] [and yet how often do you do it anyway]

927

i have to use a different IDE
so workspace save interval in minutes. I think setting it from 5 to 1. 
from five minutes to 1 minutes is essentially the same as auto-save. right?

928

let's put it this way
i haven't even started
and i'm already lost

there was a reading that i kind of missed

Oracle. (1995). Documentation: The Java™ Tutorials - 
Object-Oriented Programming Concepts. Retrieved from 
[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/index.html]
[we are going to have a competition] [] [there will be winners]
and there will be losers. [we already know who the winners are]

929

i remember downloading a modding
program for empire total war
and it was hosted on github
it can actually  mod any total war game

what was it. well, i don't remember it
having a landing page
and all the details were
right there on the github repository
so i guess i don't really need a landing page
for every repository

but it was a convention established
in the first programming course i took
so i think i'll continue to do it.

930

I don't even know where to begin.
I'm setting up a landing page for this repository

yeah, i honestly don't even know where to begin
i think that i might get caught up
or
I might get tied down creating
this landing page.

it's kind of nice to type with a keyboard
again. i've been using speech to text
for a while.

<br><br>With that in mind I'm going to abandon formatting it in this new way.

<p> I think I'm going to switch to a single line display. I had 10 buy orders filled, and 19 sell orders filled. Once Again: The goal
is to have an equal number of buy and sell orders filled on any given day. Is there something that I should be doing right now?

well, obviosuly there is something that I need to be doing, there are several things that I need to be doing, and that I need to get done, 
but where do I start? Which one of these tasks do I start with?</p>
<p> Well, I don't exactly know what to do. I'll take the previous day's estimate and start There

<br><br>Estimate for 10/17/2023

935

</p> [it's an experimental writing style it's something. it's you know it's experimental]
<p>I'm honestly total lost on this. Like I really don't know what to do next, at this point. I'm thinking that something is going to happen
in either direction, but. I have really no idea what. When I look at the weekly chart, I'm thinking that the bars will head toward
the upper band, and when I look at the daily chart, I'm thinking that the bars will head toward the lower band. A red daily bar for tomorrow would
not turn the weekly bar red, because, well, it's only Wednesday. Right? Anyway, usually the Bollinger Bands widen after they've been narrow for a while
so, something has to happen, up or down, in order for them to widen, and statistically speaking, it's more likley that whatever it is, it's going to 
be within the bands, and in this case, that would mean a downward bar, or a red bar or whatever. Right? I'm going to revise my estimate:

[but there was something about] <br><br>Revised Estimate for 10/18/2023 
<br><br>Range: .66 [the discussion that wasn't really clear to me]
<br>Trend: None [there was something that wasn't really clear to me]

<br>O/C: Open Higher than Close. [how everything is such a nightmare]
[for me, it don't know, it's basically over] </p> [how everything is such a nightmare.]

<p>The other possibility is that it skids upward along the top band on the daily chart. I'm going to revise my estimate again.

<br><br>Revised Estimate for 10/18/2023 
<br><br>Range: .68

<br>O/C: Open Higher than Close.
[one of the things is that] </p> [there wasn't anything that I could do at that point.]
[ when the trade of goods increases on both sides]
<p> Well, I'm going to place my orders. Since I think that bands are going to widen, I'm going to move my orders outward, rather than inward. or away from  

the midpoint rather than toward the midpoint.

[to all of those beans!]
<p>So. What am I thinking right now? Well. I have no idea. The time is actually 21:35, two hours after creating the heading
for this post. I have a homework assignment that I really haven't even looked at. and I need to look at it, and, I actually 
need to turn it in. Tomorrow I think.</p> 
<p>Today is now already the 17th. It's really amazing how quickly time passes.</p>

<p> Okay, where to start? I didn't have a single dime of overlap. The day range for SPLG was 50.99 - 51.40, and my estimate was
50.20 to 50.83. So let's try again. Let's review how the day went. I had five buy orders filled and nine sell orders filled.
</p>

<p>the goal is to have an equal number of sell orders and buy orders filled. on any given day. Looking at Friday, I bought 7 more shares than I sold, 
today I sold 4 more shares than I bought.
[I think that even if you are failing in a major way] </p> [people still want to see you fail in a major way. again.]

<p>So, where to start? Well, and ADX of 17.50 suggests that there is no trend. So I'm estimating that tomorrow being a down day
is equally likely as tomorrow being an up day. I need to come up with something a little more precise, but, like how? Next, I'm estimating That
the day range will be .60 based on a 20 day ATR of, well, .60, so. HA! Next: I'm estimating that SPLG will open higher than it closes, this is 
because she shorter time lines, the 60 minute charts are  near the top of the upper Bollinger Band. So where am I at?

<br><br>Range: .60 
<br>Trend: None 
<br>Midpoint: 51.20
<br>Range: 50.90 - 51.50

<br>O/C: Open Higher than Close. [you have to hide - it's a dark forest out there - you have to hide - people want to see you fail]

</p> <p>Where did my vape go? Anway, I guess that's it for this post. I have to think if there is anything else I need to do today.</p>

<p class= "adventuretitle" >Adventure # 12 - 10/16/2023 12:53</p>

<p>What am I thinking about right now? well, I'm writing this at 0314, so, several hours after when I first started this post. It's Monday,
and I'm not sure what I really need to do. It's the middle of the month already. what a nightmare. The vehicle registration stuff is done,
but was that all I managed to do yestereday?</p> <p>How did the smog check stuff go? well, the first place I went to was not even really
a smog check location, i thought it was, but, it was actually a car wash. This is a gas station near the grocery store, I always thought that 
it had a smog check station attached to it, but it was just a car wash, not a smog check. so then i just decided that I would pick a place 
on Google Maps that's listed as a smog check location. I went there, and it was closed. so then I went to the next location listed on Google Maps.
and then I went home and renewed my vehicle registration.
</p><p>A lot of things can go wrong between now, and the Fall Semester of 2024, in fact, a lot of things can go wrong between now and the 
<i>Spring</i> Semester of 2024.</p>

<p>Okay. what was I expecting SPLG to be at today? because it looks like I'm already wrong. On Saturday I wrote: 
"My best guess is that SPLG will be between 50.20 and 50.83" Well, There's really not telling if I'm already wrong. Friday was my first
time estimating an OHLC bar, so, I have to see how today plays out. If the OHLC bar is something like 50.90 to 51.50, then, my estimate was way off, 
but an OHLC bar of 50.10 to 50.90 would be kind of in line with what I estimated.</p>
<p>...</p> [i don't really think it was ever really ideal to - you know - come out here - i don't think that it was the best idea]

[it's easy] <p> I need to get a smog check, and then I can renew my vehicle registration, my registration expired yesterday, so I had to pay
for a temporary moving permit. Headache. I was playing Rome Total War 2 earlier, but, the game froze so I had to force a restart, and 
at this point I'm no longer really in the mood to play that game.
[where maybe everything worked out well and maybe it was all amazing] </p>
<p>So I got all that vehicle registration stuff done. Smog Check and payment and all that. It was about 220 all together. 

It wasn't unexpected, but it was something I didn't really budget for. This is irritating because I don't really have
any money coming in. Getting paid out on my unemployment claim is almost hopeless at this point. What else do I need to do? Is there anything else
that I can do today? Is there anything else that needs to be done today?</p>

<p>I think about that scene in <i>The Fifth Element</i> where Zorg says:"Fire One-Million," and he's doing this in an effort to tame 
inflation, and firiing 
one-million is in contrast to firing five-hundred thousand. but. I think that if <i>The Fifth Element</i> were more "Space Odyssey" 
and Less "Star Wars"

Zorg would be increasing interest rates by one percent, in contrast to increasing interest rates by half a percent.
</p> <p>I also think that it's less likely that layoff notices would be sent out, and you know, instead it would be something like
Korben Dallas finding his 
workplace becoming a high-attrition environment.</p><p>I don't know how many times I've taken a job, only to find that the workplace is 
a high-attrition

environment. and then thinking: why did they hire me in the first place? they didn't really think I was going to tolerate this kind of
treatment, did they?
[but really it really is and it really is nice and easy] </p> [it's part of the thing that makes things easy]

941

<p>I'm trying to think about what to do about work, finding a job and all that. My expectation is that any kind of factory 
or warehouse work or any position at any company in a capital intensive business is going to be a high-attrition environment,
especially with interest rates as high as they are, a factory owner is better off firing everybody,

liquidating the factory, and investing that capital into bonds,
and will probably make more money doing so, especially with interest rates as high as they are.

and you wouldn't have to deal with the headache of running a business, just the headache of collecting interest payments.
</p> <p>Zorg: Fire one million, sell the cabs, shove the money into bonds, and collect the interest. Now that Korben Dallas
is no longer employed, he'll probably spend less money on Chinese Food, which should bring down the inflation rate on the Chinese food
portion of the consumer price index, which I don't think actually includes food.

</p> <p>I'm trying to figure out why it's always me that's the target of targeted attrition, like, do I really contribute all that much
to inflation? Like, increasing interest rates is supposed to motivate businesses to fire people, would you rather own a business, and collect 
profits, or would you rather own bonds,

and collect interest? the correct answer is: whatever pays more. so when bonds pay more than businesses, you shift money from businesses 
to bonds, firing people in the process,
and when people get fired, they have

less money to spend, and when they have less money to spend, prices increase at a slower rate, and that means inflation slows down. but, i don't 
spend that much money to begin with, so, me. being employed. doesn't really contribute to inflation. so don't target me for attrition, Zorg, other
people contribute more to inflation than I do. other people should get targeted for attrition. not me. 
</p> <p>but, um, yeah. things are kind of difficult right now, and, kind of a nightmare.</p>

<p>One of my classmates asked me for help on an older project that she was catching up on. I sent her a link to my GitHub link to that particularl
project, but realized that she might not be using GitHub yet. So I created a CodePen version of project 10 created specificially for Codepen. I created
a Project 10 for display on CodePen, but that was just the GitHub version iframed into CodePen, but for the new project 10 version in codepen, I cloned
the actual code from GitHub and put it into a CodePen Pen, it didn't work at first, so I had to change the iframe slider to reference my older Codepen Project Specifically.
angry. irritated - annoyed these things I really don't even know what to say about this </p>

<p>I'm not sure if that's really well explained, but, things are referenced differently in CodePen such that, it really doesn't 
work well unless I use absolute references, and in many cases, not all references work well.

<p>So, I just need to focus on getting through the course that I'm already taking. This turned out to be a really good
program and I'm really pleased that I decided to take it. So, for UNLV, I have to take a calculus class for the Spring 2024 Semester,
which I'm thinking is going to be the second semester calculus class, since I had taken the first semester of calculus several
years ago. I have to get a B in that class. I'm wanting, and I'm hoping that I can take this class online.

i didn't exactly state the obvious but I did state that things are not going well </p>
and yet, the store ran out of egg-nog anyway? <p>...</p> I do not understand what is wrong with their ERP SYSTEM!
<p class= "adventuretitle" >Adventure # 7 - 10/13/2023 12:28</p> [] WHERE THE FUCK IS THE EGG-NOG!

[] I decided to start a new life as a <p> petals on a - here we are
I found it again, i discovered what was already previously
known to the whole of the universe, but I found it again.

Alright, so what are we looking at here, um SPLG. it's almost 4:00 PM Eastern Time, 
so I guess this is basically what happened today. A total of 13 of my limit buys were 
excecuted, and a total of 4 of my limit sell orders were excecuted, so I ended up buying 7 more shares than I sold.
<br>
<p> This isn't a big deal or anything because SPLG is a long term position for me, and I'm always happy to have more
shares of SPLG, but that not really what I'm trying to accomplish here.</p>
<p>The goal is to end the day with the same number of shares bought as shares sold. so any time I have too many
extra shares bought or too many extra shares sold, then that means I didn't predict the trading range for that day correctly.
</p>
    
951    
    
[but there were things that were more interesting than the things that were amazing] </p>
<img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 123333.png" alt="Stock Charge of Ticker Symbol SPLG">
<br> [things that were really amazing. and were totally amazing.] <br>
<img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 123807.png" alt="Trades Place for Ticker Symbol SPLG">

<p>Okay, so let's try again for Monday. My best guess is that SPLG will be between 50.20 and 50.83, see chart below.</p> 
<img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 130204.png" alt="Stock Charge of Ticker Symbol SPLG">
<p>I'll place 2 orders, one in each direction.</p>
<img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 130723.png" alt="Trades Place for Ticker Symbol SPLG">

<p>So we will see how that goes. The goal for tomorrow is to have two shares bought, and two shares sold. Or, well, since I have so many 
outstanding orders at this point, to have the same number of buy orders excecuted as sell orders.</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason why I'm only doing 1 share at a time, usually I do 10, is because I really screwed up on 10/05/2023 and sold about 

70 more shares than I bought, which really threw everything off. In the following days I ended up selling 207 more shares than I wanted 
to, so I'm at the point of, you know, I basically gotta keep this at 1 share at a time until I'm back at my goal of getting those 207 
shares back, and, even though I accumulated 7 more shares than I wanted too today, that accumulation really doesn't count because I want 
those 207 shares back at 49.90, and not higher.</p>

<p>and 49.90 is still, you know, in the realm of possibility, in fact, I couldn't find a reason to buy back in at higher than 49.90, even
after 4 green days because, at no point did there seem to be confirmation of a trend change, or, at least I don't seem to see anything. 
Maybe if it hit above 51.66, but, I probably still would have waited out even if it did hit 51.66.
[i don't really know well, you know. i don't really know] </p> [there was something there - well it was not really there]

<img src=".\media\Screenshot 2023-10-13 133205.png" alt="Stock Charge of Ticker Symbol SPLG">
<p>Anyway, that last chart was a lot to look at. I went to UNLV today to have the meeting with the MSQF Program Director. 
From the conversation it seems clear that I won't be admitted to the program for the Spring Semester of 2024, I could 
go to UNLV for Spring 2024, but, only to take a prerequisite course. and then I can get into the program for Fall 2024. 
This is one of those times where I really hope that I can take this course online. </p> [] I don't know what the hell to do about that []

<p>Otherwise than that, I'm really tired. I'm worried though. The reason I was shooting for a Spring 2024 admission is because
there are so many things can go wrong between now and January, and, there are even more things that can go wrong between now and August 2024.
you know, and, this is just another nightmare.

952

[well, and, there was something going on there there was really something interesting] </p> [i don't]
<div> [one of those things was. well. you know. it wasn't what i anticipated it would be] <p> these []

[there were things out there that were interesting] <p>...</p> [] it might be something somewhere []
<p class= "adventuretitle" >Adventure # 6 - 10/12/2023 20:47</p><p> in [] in the future something that goes on

I am exhausted. I have a meeting tomorrow regarding admission to UNLV. I have to figure this out. It's not
clear to me what we will be discussing. I don't know how many times I've sent transcripts and submitted
applications to UNLV, and all that. [] later but who really know who really thinks about that [] well

I don't know what's on my mind exactly. I'm tired. Going back to work for those two weeks or whatever. It made
me realize that. I don't know. Like. Working in a factory or a warehouse is going to be just another dead end.
It's never really gone anywhere, and, as far as I can tell, it's not really going to go anywhere.

I remember going into one interview recently and, there was this kind of weird moment where, the interviewer
seemed to. Well, she stated that she was looking for someone who was looking to stay with the organization for
the next 20 years or something. and I was thinking. I was thinking later, but. do I really plan 20 years ahead?
do I have a 20 year plan? because I already know that I don't have a 20 year plan, but if I did have a 20 year plan
or, something. I sure as hell wouldn't be interviewing for your company. [] you said that these were interesting []

953

you know. [] they were in fact more boring that I could have ever imagined [she had this distinct flavor]
[] it was something akin to [] and well [i don't really want to go into details]
and they say [] well that a true gentelman never [] will never kiss and tell, but I did not kiss her!
[i tasted her! her punani! and it had a distict flavor!] 

if I have to plan for the next 20 years, the most obvious thing to do is not to work for some company that I don't
see myself working at for 20 years. you know. like I don't really see myself working there for 20 years, or even 2 years.

You know. There isn't a single company that I've ever worked for, or that I've ever applied for, that I really saw myself
working at for 20 years. [] how would i discribe the flavor? it was something like [] well it was something akin to [] well

I mean the most obvious thing to do, if I'm planning for the next 20 years. is. to go back to college. develop some
new skill or whatever. you know [] it had a distinct flavor. [I am not able to put into words exactly what the flavor could]
be compared to but was - shall i compare they punani to summer's eve! it was douche flavored punani! THATS! WHAT IT WAS!

So what am I thinking about right now. I got sidetracked from putting down my thoughts for Adventure # 4. Well.
I don't know. I tend to be bombarded with stuff. Various stuffs. Various things. This or that. Whatever. I started
obsessing over the color of the buttons on my landing page. made a little bit of progress. realized I don't know
jack about javascript. figured I'd get around to it later. and then I started 
obsessing over my project carousel. so that's basically what happened. I'm tying to recollect about what happend 
yesterday, and the things I'm thinking about for the next couple days. The forseeable future, which as of right now.
can be measured only. in days.

955

I got sidetracked yet again. I don't know where I was.

Quam pulchra es sicut ibi stabat Qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet consectetur 
ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem Quae te dementia cepit Forsan et 
haec olim meminisse juvabit Militat omnis amans  omnia vincit amor  

I got sidetracked yet again. The above text should read something like 
How beautiful you are standing there! who gullibly believes you are everything? who seeks pain to derive some pleasure from pain? What madness
posesses you? We will remember this fondly: every lover is a fighter: Love conquers all.

This is basically just a collage of different latin quotes. Famous ones. including the most famous latin text of all: 

lorem ipsum.

This is supposed to be funny. The most famous latin quote should be omnia vincit amor, love conquers all, but I don't think that it is, i mean, more
well known than lorem ipsum. the other funny thing is that, delorem ipsum, is from, i guess, cicero, but his most famous line should actually be:

Carthago delenda est

956

and um, I guess I came across: Militat omnis amans, from Ovid
which translates to: every lover is a fighter
<br>
<br>every lover
<br><i>is</i>
<br>a fighter
<br><br>
Which is really funny because that's clearly a response to the phrase: "I'm a lover not a fighter." 
and he does this to omnia vincent amore as well, where he say something like:

957

Love conquers all? so too will I triumph over love!

but I couldn't find that quote online, or at least, 
I had a lot of trouble finding it because all searches for

Omnia vincent amore, ovid come up only with virgils original line.

anyway.

I got sidetracked again, I had an ititial version of project 8 that I was having a lot of trouble with, so, I stopped working on it and
started completely over. There is a screenshot of it in my media folder. I don't know what the issue was. or. I don't remember since project 8
feels like it was something I did such a long time ago, but whatever it was. I think it was that I was having trouble changing things. so I started with
a different templete or whatever it's called in wordpress, and deleted more or less everything but the color scheme, and re-did the entire
thing element by element. so. that's how it went. super easy and I really enjoyed it.


I feel like there was something I'm supposed to do today, but, whatever it is, it's clearly slipped my mind. <br><br>

This is probably going to be the least user friendly blog ever. Tell me: are you reading this? Is it nice and user friendly?
because I'm not sure I really care, you're basically reading my diary. Whether or not it's user friendly isn't really my problem.
One of the issues I have with what I post on chestnutandhazel.com is that It's hosted, or whatever, it's really just an account
on blogger.com, so since it's basically a social media account, I have to comply with the community guidles of blogger.com, and
since I have adsense active on that page, I also have to comply with any adsense advertiser standards, so I have my hands tied 
in many respects. chestnutandhazel.com continues to get flagged over and over and over, and in many cases I don't really want to 
deal with it right away.

the other issue is that I also have to post what I write somewhere, so that I can use the standard copyright registration form,
rather than the unpublished copyright registration form, so, that's another issue. so you know, it's kind of whatever.

This is a photograph of a mixed media composition. I took two paintings that I bought by a local artist, put a Zoloft pen

The paintings are by Vanessa Callanta. what stood out to me about Callanta's Painting "All Work and No Play" was how

971

I really have to think about it. 
I'm really not in the mood for de-monetization so
maybe I'll hold off on writing such poem.

972

You are such a f{u}ck[i]ng Qu[ee]f [Que]en! (2024)

I know you want a man with such a substantial weiner
but what's so amazing about really substantial weiners?
I know that his weiner is more substantial than mine.

but what substance is there to having such a substantial 
weiner? and what does it matter outside of the context of 
a weiner measuring contest? really? why does it matter?

You are such a queef queen any way scented like roses and
the smell the vaginal gasses that your punani produces!
everyone knows that miss queef queen is in the room! there 

is something in the air and if it's not the liquid come
shots then it must not be the liquid come kingdom come and 
then you said something nasty about how things turn around 

when you least expect them to, but what could a slender 
weiner do for you when you have such a substantial booty?
you must need a substantial weiner to satisfy you! well 

guess what! i could substantiate that I now have a more 
substantial weiner than I did before. It is more glorious 
that anything you have ever been familar with and more amazing too

way more amazing and it has a flavor. a very distinct flavor!
I promise that you will not be disappointed with the amazing
with the amazing flavor profile of what you must know is amazing!

but anyway . it couldn't be more obvious to me . that he is part .

I think that there are times when </p> validation - you know - feeling good about youself is really - about

and I think . I think that I don't really want to participate in that game </p> there is - if it's going to

I don't really even want to get invloved - really - <p class= "adventuretitle" > I don't see why it would be

I'm more tired than ever. More than I can possibly imagine. Today was a long day. Small victories I guess.

980

I consider this published <p> and I consider Chestnut + Hazel to be a publisher!
and I think that everything is really going to be amazing and I think everything 
is going to go okay and I think everything is going to go amazing and I really think
that the world is going to get amazing and I really think that the best of all those
things are going to be even more amazing than the rest of the gibberish that was produced

981

I consider this published, even if it's unlikley anyone will come across this
or read it. There are times when I want to write things, but, less and less I feel
the desire to write them on chestnutandhazel.com I don't know what it is, but, I'm
starting to feel more "On Stage" when I write and post things there.

982

Maybe a few years back it seemed, it felt like there wasn't anyone really, you know
reading it.

983

I need to be working on Project 11, but for some reason I'm just not really getting anything done.
I've managed to figure out where my Contact Form is. It's something that I haven't really messed with
in a while, but Project 11 entails messing with it. So. That's what I'm up to.

984

There's a lot of cleaning up that needs to be done with the index page of my Github Repository,
and a lot of that cleaning up, with the code, cleaning up the appearance of my code wouldn't
really change the outward appearance of my page. It would just make it easier to change things around
but, considering that the course is almost over, I'm not really sure how much it makes sense to really
do anything about it.

985

I really have to get Project 11 done. I was reviewing the recording of the class session, and
it looks easy, and, I remember it being easy when I was doing it. I don't remember, but I 
think that I napped through part of the class, and came back around to it later.

986

One of the things about the class is that, I'm much more open to distance learning, or online coursework, or virtual classrooms,
or whatever, now that I've done it, back in 2018 or 2019 I think that I was really skeptical about it, and
I kind of brushed off a recruiter for an online degree program, but um, I think that I'm more open to it now.

987

I tried to get the favicon to work on GitHub, but, I can't seem to figure it out, and, since it's not an assignment,
I really didn't pursue the thing past the point of absolute frustration.

988

The favicon is more vanity than any kind of practical kind of a thing. Like I don't have a practical reason for setting 
up the favicon on GitHub other than the desire to have one.

989

I'm exhausted, and I really haven't done anything for project 11 yet.
I want to take a nap, but, that's a little bit of a risk considering that it's due today.
and, I really have to get to it because, in all probability, it's something that can be done in an hour or two, at most.
I'm so tired. I want to get a soda.

990

I don't know what to do about CodePen. Migrating things to github is a small nightmare.

991

I'm feeling incredibly scatter brained. I have a project due for my software and web development course today, and I haven't even started. 
This should be simple, so I'm not too worried about it, but, at the same time, I know from the past that these things could take quite 
a while if I hit a brick wall.

992

There are other issues that I'm facing, especially on the income front. The temp assignment was not a particularly good fit, and, I 
really get the feeling that I should avoid any kind of warehouse or factory work, even though, that's sort of what I've been doing 
for the past five years, but I don't have the slightest clue what to look for.

993

Life is such an unbelievable struggle. I don't really know what to do about money. Somewhere in the back of my mind there's 
this voice telling me that I should stop looking for a job or employment or whatever, and, that I should focus on trying to 
make money doing stock market shit.

994

but. well man I really. I'm really frustrated right now. this. is. a nightmare. a real nightmare. a total
disaster everything is going straight down the toilet and I am failing MIS 768 and this is the first step.
in a series of steps that eventually lead to me dropping out of school. this is a nightmare. a real nightmare.

Reflection # 714 by Chestnut and Hazel
I don't know exactly what I've been spending on buying lunch and soda at work, 
but I know that it is too damn much, I want to say it is around 15 dollars per day. 
Too fucking much. I have to cut down on that for sure.

Notes written on 10/10/2023 @ 10:19 AM

I think that I wrote this post while I was working at Case New Holland. I'm surprised that I was really spending that much. I 
Wonder what I was buying? I don't really remember. I think that it was mostly energy drinks. I don't remember my exact hours. 
It was overnight is as much as I remember. In Cameron, MO there isn't really much to eat if you're up at odd hours.

997

I'm working on Project 11 for my Web and Software Development course. I'm not really getting much done. I'm getting sidetracked
with other things. I'm really amazed that I get so little done, especially considering that I've had few other obligations other
than class these past few months. I really wonder what I've been doing.

998

Earlier in the course I would have a lot of fun playing around with our daily assignments, but, I haven't really done that in a
while, even though there have been plenty of opportunities to do so.

999

I'm really frustrated with how everything is turning out right now. Really frustrated.
I'm really [so frustrated right now really irritated really irritated this is really]
a disaster a nightmare a total disaster everything is falling apart right now this is 
basically the end of the world for me this is almost basically the end of the world. for me.

The Chicken Story by Kenneth Larot Yamat dba Chestnut + Hazel (2024) 

when the chicken
first crossed the road
the chicken thought 
in it's avian brain

i like this road.
this is a nice road
and it is a road that

does not appear to be well 
traveled
and yet still seems so well

whatever it was
i don't really know.
i wasn't actually there.

but this is an old story that many 
people have told and retold 
throughout the generations 
so remember it 

and yet there is one aspect 
of the story that proves 
to be a major oversight on the part 
of so many scholars of the chicken story 

the chicken 
encountered 
a frog 
on the other side of the road 

the frog, named: frog. ur. 
was trying to cross the road 
to get to the side  
of the road the chicken was previously on 

1003

there were so many goats there were so many goats there were </p> so many
all of the goat were there and . all of the goats were wearing . coats of fur . that were

that many people love and people enjoy having coats made of goat wool and all that.

[some of the best things that there could possibly be and we]

1005

I watched two documentaries.
One on the Sino Japanese war.
The one that morphed into world
War 2. And one on the Japanese
Industrial revolution.

So. I wanted to think about why
Things ended at the OTA. It's been
A while. And I think. Deserves some
Reflection.

1006

Lets say that all decisions can be
Simplified. That all decisions
Come to a fork. Bifurcate or
Whatever. Like. You are faced
With a decision. And your choices
Are always two. At first.

Think of this. In a standard road.
You have two choices when you
Reach an intersection. You can
Continue down the road. Or turn.
Two choices. If you choose to
Turn. You can choose left or right.
Two choices. And so on. Some
Might think of this as three choices.
You can travel straight. Left. Or right.
But you can also think of it the way
I did. Of two choices. One choice
Having two sub choices.

1007

Which way of thinking is more
Simple? Which way of thinking is
Less convoluted? Which way of
Thinking is cleaner. I have no idea.
But I think. That bifurcation allows
Points in the decision making
Process to be more clearly marked.
And either way. You can still account
For all possible decisions.

So back to my former boss at the
OTA. She could have extended me.
Or she could have decided not to
Extend me. We already know what
Decision she made. But let's figure
Out what she was thinking.

1008

Now. It didn't bother me that I wasn't
Formally employed by the OTA.
Who cares right? Some people do
Though. Some people do like to
Be official or whatever.

And I'm not being dismissive
About the desire to be official.
I wanted to be official with Ash.
But she didn't want to be official
Unless we were super fucking
Official.

1009

In my thinking though. Even when a
Person is formally employed. Their
Continued employment is really
Just an extension. It just goes by
A different term. People think of
It differently. But I don't. People
Think of it differently because
Different words are used. But I'd say
The mechanics of being a contractor
On an extension basis. And being
A formal employee whose
Performance is measured at
Regular intervals. It's the same
Thing. If you aren't handed a pink
Slip when you show up for work.
You have been extended. Haha.

So she could have extended me.
Or not extended me. If she extended
Me. I don't know what would
Happen. Would she have to buy
My contract from the staffing
Agency? And pay some kind
Of a premium to do so? I have no
Idea.

1010

I don't know what the extension
Decisions would be. If she would
Have been forced to decide whether
Or not to keep me on a contract
Basis indefinitely. Or decide to
Make me a formal employee of the
OTA. I have no idea. Really no idea.

And maybe that is where the issue
Arose. Maybe the issue was that
She had to decide whether or not
To formalize my employment or
Not. She may have wanted to
Extend. But could not formalize
My employment for whatever
Reason. And maybe formalizing
Was the only way to extend.

1011

So basically. Maybe she wanted to
Extend. But not formalize. Since
She could not extend without
Formalizing. She therefore could
Not extend. So she decided not
To extend. And maybe that was it.

The Chicken Story by Kenneth Larot Yamat dba Chestnut + Hazel (2024) 
 
when the chicken
first crossed the road
the chicken thought 
in it's avian brain
 
i like this road.
this is a nice road
and it is a road that
 
does not appear to be well 
traveled
and yet still seems so well
maintained
and it does not
appear to have very much
 
traffic   
  and so  
  the chicken 
crossed the road in an
attempt to get to the other side
 
it went well for the chicken 
and the chicken was able to find 
whatever it is chickens eat.
 
chicken food 
perhaps
or maybe duck food.
 
whatever it was
i don't really know.
i wasn't actually there.
 
but this is an old story that many 
people have told and retold 
throughout the generations 
so remember it 
 
and yet there is one aspect 
of the story that proves 
to be a major oversight on the part 
of so many scholars of the chicken story 
 
the chicken 
encountered 
a frog 
on the other side of the road 
 
the frog, named: frog. ur. 
was trying to cross the road 
to get to the side  
of the road the chicken was previously on

[I'm really fucking angry and really furious right now]
<p> What Do You Think About Butter? <br>
By Chestnut + Hazel at October 22, 2022 <br>
[really angry about everything furious!] <br>
These are the things I think
about when I think about 
butter: well, first and foremost
butter is not what makes the
world go round. Something.
some kind of force makes
the world go round, and I 
think that the force in question
would be called momentum,
or maybe it would be called 
inertia, but whatever the force
is called, I doubt that it
is called butter, and therefore!
when people ask what force
makes the world go round
just be aware that butter is 
not the answer to that question! </p>

I can't stop thinking about how angry I am about everything <p> I remember this

I remember that I was working at a State Prison in the town, and I remember
that the training center for this role was in a larger city, still a small city,
St. Joseph, not too far away. I got into a car crash on the highway into St. Joseph.
My car was a total loss as a result of the crash. It would be 8 months later before I could

I didn't go to bunriths funeral. not because i didn't care to go or because i thought that i
had more important things to do. but. the issue was that i didn't want to go back
to the bay area. i was fucking homeless my last few months there, and even though
i don't feel like my life was totally bad during those months of homelessness. i just
harbored a hell of a lot of resentment for the way that things went.

what a nightmare. a total nightmare. I don't know what else to say.

become new ideas where 

all trees become new flowers and
these flowers taste like new objects that were

if there were more coins in the place where the coins happen to be
where the fountain is new where the water 
churns in the pond.

it seems you can say 
how we spent quality
time but don't go into 

too many details because 
the details are amazing 
and the chickens are in the
details you know they are

1050

I'm really frustrated right now. 
I really feel like going on a short 
road trip to blow off some steam, but 
I kind of scheduled an appointment for 
Monday, but there was no confirmation 
on the other side, so. and today is 
already monday. so. a road trip is kind 
of out of the question right now.

this might be a new project a very interesting
new project and you might get excited about 
how it all turns out how it all turns out to be.

1051

I finally bought a new phone. My last one cracked 
not too long after I bought it. It was weird because 
I hadn't cracked a phone that soon after buying it 
in a while. I think I had it for 7 months. My last 
phone was really falling apart, it wasn't just cracked.

1052

quality time is the best 
kind of time 
it is high quality time
spent on high quality 
things where you make 

new ideas where you 
see new things to see and 
you do a lot of 
new things to do.

1053

I bought a parking pass. I think that I only have 
class once a week, and it's after parking enforcement 
hours. so maybe I didn't really need to pay for a parking 
permit, but then again, I might be on campus to do this or 
that, and, I'm going to apply for positions on campus, 
so I might use it.

I need to get a new phone, my current phone is cracked, 
and, it's also kind of falling apart.

1054

i was happy when I heard that you made
a new kind of candy 
that it was some new

kind of invention that it 
was the best kind of 
invention that you 
were able to invent

1055

and it was amazing but it was Torrance 
that made the newest of them all and it was 
torn apart by animals.

i have to be prudent about how i waste my time.
I bought a new toilet seat. The wood ones were 
less expensive than the plastic ones, which was 
nice, so, I bought a wood one.

there was a new kind 
of wood that was recently invented 
that was recently discovered

in the mountains of peru
where the andeans 
and the incas reside

1056

classes start on the 16th. the two orientation 
classes are over. I wore a tie for the second day, 
but, it was mostly for getting a portrait photograph 
taken, but, I seem to have missed it. I guess I 
thought that there would be a kind of designated 
time to get our portrait photos taken, but, it was 
more of whenever you have the opportunity to get one 
kind of deal. and. yeah, i missed it.

1057

but there were some downsides
that i could not recover from
that i thought were 

worse than anything i ever had 
to deal with before that i never
had to think about before 

that i really never wanted to 
deal with and that i was 
really irritated about.

1058

Back in November I bought a vape pen a refillable one after trying the 
disposable vape pens for a while and this thing will not stop leaking 
I don't know what to do I'm thinking about getting a different type of 
vape pen I'm not sure I really like the disposable vape pens but it's 
primarily based on cost because the disposables are just so expensive

1059

back then we all 
sat around the fire 
playing games with our
fingers making 

strange images of strange
animals of strange
object and making 
strange sounds and saying

strange things
to one another and thinking
strange things about our
strange fears of the forest.

1060

School has started and yesterday 
was our first day of orientation 
this semester I'm taking two classes 
both of them are MIS classes

1061

I'm in a really lousy mood right now. 
I'm kind of stressed out. I'm kind of 
frustrated about things right now.

I managed to finish quite a bit of the 
required tasks for school. Mostly 
orientation related tasks and online modules.

I need to go out Door Dashing and all 
that, but I'm really tired right now, 
but it's kind of a mood related fatigue.

1062

i wanted to see 
how you were doing
how you said that

there was something you
were eating and that
it had a nice taste

that it had a nice texture
that it had a nice smell
that it was amazing
just to eat it and it was 

amazing just to feel it
against your tongue 
and it was amazing to
enjoy it in that way.

1063

School starts soon. Later on in the month. 
There are a few things I need to get done to 
prepare, but I've been so busy doing DoorDash 
that I haven't exactly come around to it, but 
I have to get it done today.

1064

i wanted to 
tell you something
earlier about

how it all began how it
all started how it all was
more amazing 

and how it did get 
worse before it
eventually got better.

1065

there were things i saw
out there in the forest
that i didn't see when 
i was in the jungle 
or even when i was in
the desert or even
when i was on the plains 
or even when i was in the
tundra or the grasslands
or the mountains or the hills

whatever it was that i saw
i was not really able to tell you
exactly what it was or what
it was all about or what it
happened to be or what there
was when the people who 
also saw it said something
about it and mentioned it.

1066

Life is something of a nightmare right now.
I thought the bleeding would stop, that I'd 
get my budget in order during December, but 
that is something that did not happen.

I don't even want to make any remarks about 
what I anticipate for January, out of a fear 
that I might jinx it.

I'm enrolled in the entrepreneurship program 
I'm not sure what kind of business I would 
start if I were to start one the other day I 
was trying to buy clothes and I just have so 
many problems with getting the correct fit and 
if I were to start something it would be like 
some kind of clothes business I thought about 
buying a sewing machine because like my pants 
are just too damn long but I don't know if I 
really want to start sewing stuff because it's 
such a headache I have all these pants that just 
don't fit and it never really mattered because I 
always wore boots so like if if my pants were too 
long it wasn't really a problem and I really didn't 
notice.

1067

A few days ago I took a 
road trip from Las Vegas, 
to San Diego, to Yuma, and 
back to Las Vegas. San Diego 
reminds me of Austin, just 
older and larger.

1068

there was something
about that woman's
face that i thought
was very nice it was

a very nice face that 
she had on her neck

i thought it was a nice
face i thought it was
a really nice face and

i think that it is still a very
nice face and it is the
face of a princess

1069

I went on a road trip. not a 
very exciting one, but, I don't 
know. I'm in a slightly better 
mood than before. I went from 
Las Vegas, to San Diego, to Yuma, 
and back to Vegas.

1070

and whenever it happened I thought
it would not happen again because
lightning never really ever strikes

twice and it really never becomes 
the whole thing that is really the
most important things that we think
about and wonder about and change.

1071

I'm using text to speech to write this. I 
don't really get much time to sit down and 
type so finding this feature on my phone has 
turned out to be really useful. nothing is 
punctuated and I guess that's just the way 
text to speech works, but I could always go 
back and punctuate this if I need to.

1072

Life is extremely challenging right now.

1073

this is really taking forever this is really 
a total nightmare really taking forever. and 
who knows how long this will really take. and
how long it will eventually be and how long it
will eventually take to be forever.

1074

there were changes made to 
all of the things that we saw out there 
that we wanted to say 
something about

but there was no one we could
tell these things to
because there was no one else
out there who was hearing us.

1075

Money hasn't been this tight in a while, but 
there is one positive thing. 
I think that I'm able to stop pulling money 
out of my savings, and eventually, to start 
paying down my credit balances.

1076

everything turned out to be even more
amazing than the chickens that we sold to
the chicken cooking place that sells chicken

wings at the store for people who
love to eat chicken wings.
wings are probably one
of the more delicious part
of a chicken, and, i really like
thighs, but i also really like wings.

1078

There are a few things that I realized 
while I was door dashing that made me start 
to use text to speech one of the things was 
that I can't really type if I'm driving but 
if I use the phone if somebody wants to access 
what I have to say they have to access their 
voicemail box like if I leave a message and 
so it just made more sense to use text to speech 
and send it by text the way they could just read 
whatever I said it's not like I'm really saying 
anything to complex when I'm using text to speech 
for the most part anyway.

1079

I managed to buy a jacket today.

1080

at the same time
there were people 
there who were

very nice but also
very intrusive with 
the kind of questions
they asked they always
asked strange questions.

1081

things are a kind of
object where the places
who are these words

can change into new
kinds of coins and coins
can change into new
kinds of bills there
was a woman who was

standing there very beautiful
who I did not want to interact
with because she might make
my heart stop.

1082

Um. So I did Door Dash today, 
I had one order. for like 3 hours 
of driving, and I'm somewhat discouraged. 
After spending all that money to obtain 
business licenses, and getting a commercial 
auto policy that's way more expensive than 
what I was paying for a personal policy. I'm, 
you know. Not sure what to do.

The order that I did get was somewhat 
accidental, I was toggling between per 
order and per hours just to check it out, 
and the order I got was a per hour order.

and I'm thinking, it might make sense to switch 
between the two during certain times of the day. 
The traffic was really bad in whatever area I was in.

Anyway. I called it a day after trying for 3 hours, 
and only getting one order. Some days are better than 
others, and I think. on days where it seems like slim 
pickings, it might make sense to just go back home and 
work on something else.

1083

i kind of said that this 
was where it all went south
where my fingers went
south where my lips went
south where everything went
south even my lips went south
and all my thoughts went south
and my hands went south.

1084

I deleted my facebook, instagram, 
twitter (X), and linkedin accounts. 
I also think that deleted a number of 
other social media accounts as well, 
Pinterest. I'm not sure I really used 
that account.

One of the things that sometimes worried 
me about using. one of the things that 
often worried me about deleting these 
accounts is that. Maybe. someone might 
create a fake account using my name and 
all that. I don't know. I won't worry 
about that right now. I'm honestly. really. 
I'm surprised how many other Ken Yamat, and 
kenneth Yamat profiles are out there. I guess 
my name isn't all that special after all.

there was a change 
of plans the other day
and a kind of change
of ideas and a change of mindsets

and this is what happened
it was amazing it was really
fabulous everything changed

for the 
better no kidding!

1085

There
are no words to 
describe
the agony of
eating too much
food at the buffet
when you go to
the buffet 
and eat all 
that you can eat.

it was something else
it was really something
else out there it was

really amazing it was
really a sight to see

I can't even tell you
what the heck I saw
because it was so
indescribably.

i can't even put it into words.
I really can't!

1086

if it wasn't really
all that amazing then
maybe you can tell me

what exactly you
were thinking about 
and what exactly 

you were wondering about
and what exactly
you were thinking

was the worse of the
two evils! tell me?
what do you think was worst!

1087

are you
the kind of 
person who
feeds
the ducks
when you go to the pond?

or are you the
kind of person who 
EATS THE DUCKS!
when you GO TO THE 
POND!

The Chicken Story 
by Kenneth Larot Yamat dba Chestnut + Hazel (2024) 

when the chicken
first crossed the road
the chicken thought 
in it's avian brain

i like this road.
this is a nice road
and it is a road that

does not appear to be well 
traveled
and yet still seems so well
maintained
and it does not
appear to have very much

traffic   
and so  
the chicken 
crossed the road in an
attempt to get to the other side

it went well for the chicken 
and the chicken was able to find 
whatever it is chickens eat.

chicken food 
perhaps
or maybe duck food.

whatever it was
i don't really know.
i wasn't actually there.

but this is an old story that many 
people have told and retold 
throughout the generations 
so remember it 

and yet there is one aspect 
of the story that proves 
to be a major oversight on the part 
of so many scholars of the chicken story 

the chicken 
encountered 
a frog 
on the other side of the road 

the frog, named: frog. ur. 
was trying to cross the road 
to get to the side  
of the road the chicken was previously on 

1089

The Duck Story (2024) 
by Kenneth Larot Yamat dba Chestnut + Hazel

are you
the kind of
person who
feeds
the ducks
when you go to the pond?

or are you the
kind of person who 
EATS THE DUCKS!
when you GO TO THE
POND!

Kenneth did not know how to answer
because, even though there was a true
answer, Kenneth wasn't sure if the true answer
would also be the right answer

1090

// but there were also 
// revisions that needed to 
// be made to the original 
// preliminary draft 
// there were all these 
// things that no one 
// said anything about 
// there was nothing 
// there was nothing there 
// there was something else 
// that was really amazing 
// that was really fabulous 

1091

but there were aspects of the
whole thing that
i never told anyone

one of those things
is that there was an 
owl in the tree
eating another

bird, it was eating
another bird like
i canary or something.

1092

so what am I up to right now? 
I'm really just making gaming 
videos and uploading them to YouTube. 
I tried making a YouTube short, but I 
think my video was over budget, time 
wise. I guess I'll find out. I could 
have sworn that I've seen YouTube shorts 
that are in the 4 minute range. I bought 
this down to 1:25 minutes, but I'm not sure 
if that's short enough to be a short.

1093

there was something . that really scared me . there really alarmed me .

Letters to Katastrophiena # 44 [here we are there]
I've added some content below from my 
Spanish Translations project. I've recently 
got bogged down messing around with an old 
project that doesn't seem to work in it's 
new area. I don't know what's going on, or 
why it doesn't work except on my landing page. 
I did get rid of something that was making it 
kind of a headache, and the thing was the 
transform hover effect.

1095

there was something . there were all these . there were most .
I'm going to forget about messing around with fixing the
project 11 contact form, for whatever reason, it does not
work. It's the same thing as what i have on my landing page,
so I don't know why it doesn't work. so dumb. I might try one
more thing. but then again, I really have to work on my
translations project, and this is just something I'm messing
around with.

1096

I was not happy about it . I thought it was strange . I thought .
I'm putting together the texts that I'll be translating for
this project. I'm also working on my YouTube videos. For video
editing, I'm mostly just consolidating and speeding up videos
and adding music, and uploading them, and I can't really do this
while playing the games themselves because my computer slows down
a lot.

1097

Buying a new gaming laptop is something that I thought about, but
I think that I'll wait to do it. A gaming computer that can play
the games I want to play doesn't look too expensive, but I really
have to wait to spend that kind of money right now.

1098

Two Spanish Language Authors have been replaced
César Vallejo with José de Espronceda
& Pablo Neruda with Antonio Machado
I created a few additional JavaScript functions to allow
the contact forms to be visible inside the iframe and clickable
inside the list.

1099

some of the things . where all of those things . test of all .
I think that everything has been set up, once everything is
deployed, then I can focus on making translations for the
pages that I've set up.

there are the best . these are the worst . how are these going .
So I set up the .md files for the four authors that I'm going
to translate from English to Spanish, and the four authors
that I'm going to translate from Spanish to English. I selected
all authors whose work I expect to be in the Public Domain.

1100

share what you can with . the people who do things . and smell .
Getting the Readme iframe and Document Title swap to work is complete,
the next stage in this project is to pick 4 authors to translate.

I'll pick four authors to translate from English to Spanish,
and 4 authors to translate from Spanish to English.
For English to Spanish:
William Carlos Williams
T. S. Eliot
Wallace Stevens
E. E. Cummings
For Spanish to English:
Rubén Darío
César Vallejo
Pablo Neruda
Miguel de Unamuno

1101

but i figure that i . might as well leave everything . alone where . those are
This is awesome! it actually works, the title and the document
change when clicked! I'm going to come back around to this and
continue to work on it later.

1102

I'm trying to scrub my blogs of . all these other things . that are kind of . Strange.
There are a few other things that I need to work on, I need to set up katastrophiena to 
be eligible for AdSense, and, I think that the main thing is that I need a longer history 
of posts for this blog. This might take a while, and take away from all the other things 
that I'm working on. Anyway. I'm getting sucked into computer gaming right now, not with 
any games that are new, but games that I've had for a long time. I've been thinking about 
buying a gaming laptop, something inexpensive, and I came across one, but, I really have 
to hold out on buying anything like that right now. || how these are where these are where
I have to wait before spending money on something like a new laptop, at least until next year.

1103

you saw everything . and I know you liked what you saw . and it was amazing . yeah.
Letters to Katastrophiena # 43 || but these were all of those things that were crazy.
I'm working on a number of things right now. One is setting up a page on GitHub Pages 
for my Spanish Translations Project. I was having trouble with a contact forms section 
of my page, this isn't needed for my Translations Page, I just set it up so it works, 
or, I'm just been trying to make the links work. Basically, I took Project 16, my Project 
16 page, and used it as a starting point for my Spanish Translations Project. One of the 
things I left from the old page and kept on the new page was a section for Contact Forms 
that I made throughout the course I took. There is one Contact Form that just doesn't 
really work. It's the one from Project 11 I don't know what wrong. || where are you with.

1104

and I'm really not in the mood 
to work on it because. I just 
really don't really want to work 
on it right now. So I guess I wont.

1105

but these are . but those are . if these are you .
Letters to Katastrophiena # 42 || where all things are
There is one thing that I have found that helps with 
the video uploading process, for longer videos, it makes 
sense to speed up the video all the way up to 16x speed, 
and the reason why is that, videos longer than an hour, 
and even longer than 10 minutes, are really slow paced, 
and it's much easier to get an idea of what's happening 
when the video is moving faster. This also reduces the 
file size, and makes uploading quicker. || how these are

1106

There are some games that are really slow 
paced, like the tower game that I'm playing, 
but also, the same is true for many other 
city building games as well. [here you are where]

1107

half of all of it was really . totally something else . something new and something else .
I need to come up with a better workflow for uploading gaming videos to YouTube. They take 
a hell of a long time to upload, especially larger files, I would reduce the file size, but 
it's not really clear to me how to do that. There is an issue with gaming videos, they often 
need to be high resolution, a lot of these videos need to be high resolution, I don't even 
have a very large screen on my laptop, and in many cases, the videos seem to be blurry. On 
the other hand, I'm not sure if these are going to be viewed mainly on a large screen, or a 
small screen, like a phone. || how have you been and where have you been and what have you ||
these were where they all went . these are where they all said . these are well they are new .

1108

Letters to Katastrophiena # 41 || there is something that was going on there 
I'm thinking about how everything seems to have been falling apart for me over 
these past few months. I lost my job, I haven't found a new one, and I'm burning 
through my money. I'm a little bit demotivated. or unmotivated. or just basically 
lacking very much or even any motivation. I'm cutting it close it terms of money. 
I need to find work. Land a job or something. || and hey || where have you been ||
 
The Internet connection here is slow, it's not normally this slow, but for whatever 
reason, it's slower than syrup. I'm working on a number of things right now, but 
I'm also kind of bouncing around mentally from idea to idea, from worry to worry.

Somewhere in the back of my mind I'm wondering if I'm cursed or something. Like, 
there's nothing I can do, and this is just the way things are going to go for me, 
but I have no idea why I would be cursed, or what would be the cause of the curse, 
or why I would be cursed, or who would want to place a curse on me. || I really ||

1109

I wanted to tell you something . I wanted to sell you something . maybe a horse .
Letters to Katastrophiena # 50 || and maybe I don't have a horse to sell you now .
I'm feeling worried about the future. I went in for my entrance exam for the Spanish 
Translation program, and I don't really think that it went well: I didn't really study 
because I spent these last few days immersed in my gaming, and didn't do anything else 
really, and now, I'm sick of the game, and now I probably have time to do productive 
stuff. Part of the reason I wasn't really motivated to study was because I did manage 
to get accepted into the Entrepreneurship and Innovation program, and I already enrolled 
in as many classes as I plan to take, and my original goal was to get into one program 
or the other. || and I want to tell you something very new that is novel and interesting.

1110

it was all 
over as soon
as the garbage

hit the fan 
it was really
all over as soon
as the garbage

hit the fan and 
I think that I should
have turned off
the fan.

1111

there were
new things that
were there

there were interesting
things hidden away
inside the wall of

the castle that
were more exciting
that what was not actually
there and not hiding.

there were new things
that were there

1112

and how would 
you say what was
there and
how would you

put it all
into words
the kind of
words that are spoken?

1113

there
was a chicken
and then there
was an egg
and then there
was
a duck who also
laid an egg
and there was

also an owl
who was prowling
at night the forest
could hear the owl.

1114

I guess.
that maybe it isn't actually

where the things are
the strange monsters

who are very
scary and who are very
mean

they were the monsters
but they are also the
scary guys!

1115

I shouldn't be
too upset about
the way

the duck was
prepared because
it was actually

very well prepared
and it was very
interesting

and I really liked it
because it was
really amazing.

1116

it could have been
worse it could have
been way worse

things could taken
a direction that could
have been way more

terrible than they actually
turned out way more
terrible than they actually
turned out way totally worse

1117

trade
is the key to the
oranges who are

the best way to turn lemons
into new kinds of
drinks

but there
were all these new people
there who were

nice, but then again
who were also not
very nice

I don't know how to say what 
it was all really
all about!

1118

this
was just
what it was

it was nothing
but it was just

what it actually 
was it was just
what it actually

happened to be
it was something out
there and

maybe we were friends for a while
but we also
seemed to be so much nicer
than the mean people.

1119

i didn't
have all
the things

i really needed
like i didn't have
whatever that thing
was i didn't

have it i really didn't
have it i didn't have it.

1120

i didn't
have all
the things

i really needed
like i didn't have
whatever that thing
was i didn't

have it i really didn't
have it i didn't have it.

1121

i wasn't sure what to do about that
I really don't know what to do about money right now.
I really wasnt sure what to do at the time 
I had no idea what to do or even what 
it was that would make the situation
less of a nightmare.

1122

I'm trying to think. There are a number of things I need to get done today.
I finished project 14, there were a lot of things that I wanted to do with
it, but, I ended up just going with the leaflet integration option, and
even doing that took a mountain of time. I integrated leaflet to my
Hamburgers project, and Connections for Mobile assignment.

I have a few class assignments, and I also have
some kind of professional development project that I have to
do. {how are they and where did they both go I saw them}

and [what are these different types of brackets and braces for]
I think that might be it. {and how do different people use different ones}

1123

I thought that it was
something of a strange
event, but the other

night there was
a white ball in the
sky, i think it was

the moon, but it looked
a little rounder than usual.

1124

there
was a monster 
hiding under the
trains of the

broken apples
under the tree

where the apples fall
down and hit heads
due to gravity.

1125

I don't want . things to be bad . but they are often .
very bad and there sometimes isn't much that anyone can
really do about all those . nightmares . and how they can .
Chestnut + Hazel was [say whatever they want and can be]
originally founded as the DM Literary Review.
Chestnut + Hazel was originally founded as the DM Literary Review.
a traitor to the . train of thought . of the train of thought .

1126

I was
really irritated
about all of those

things that were
going on and 
really irritated
that things

were not going 
well and things
were
getting worse
at the time.

1127

these can be really 
nice or they can be 
really amazing or 
they can be really 

fabulous or they 
can be really nice 
but there was a 

change in the way 
that they went to the 
store when the picked 
up the groceries.

1128

I don't know where else to write this. 
{there were all these things} I could write it 
on my GitHub page, but {there were flowers}
I kind of screwed up that page while 
reorganizing things, so I'll just write 
it here. [summer school. I almost considered]

The rural carrier associate is a
young woman with a lisp that lingers
long enough to wreck your week, and
fiery jade eyes that burn in your
mind every subsequent week.

I try to buy stamps, twenty is too much for
one stamp, and she can't break bills, and
I can't have them all, I ask to trade stamps,
one for one, she's not sure that's okay,
so she phones a friend; she asks
if I have exact change and I say:
yes! I do.

to do maybe they

all tell you how they

that I find special to me 

these were amazing 
these were fabulous 
these were too nice and 
too amazing not to deal with 
these were 
what I can only say 
are the worst 

1135

how can this be and how can it not be 
and what are the consequences of eating 
all of those chickens and what can be said 
I'm more or less going to be continuing this 
blog from GitHub going forward, but you can 
still see updates here from the iframe below.

about the people on the rocks where they were
something that someone else had to drink when 
they were at the bar and when they were everything 
that was all of the best of the worst and how they all 
went straight to the bottom of the ocean and whatever.

how all of the things are going how all of the things 
that happen to be amazing are worse than amazing.

"Chickens are the Newest Things" by Kenneth Larot Yamat (2024)

but there 
was something even scarier
than the dogs!

it was the CHICKENS!
they were newer to me
than were the
dogs! and they

were so much SCARIER!
while dogs often BARK!
chickens often ROAR!
they were so
SCARY!
with their CLAWS!
and their BEAKS!

1137

Chickens are the newest things

but these
were nightmares
they were
all of the things

that people write about
when they say that they had a nightmare

that they say
that they talk about when 
they say that it was a nightmare

when they know what they 
wanted when they 
remove what they are wearing.

towns full of people who are there and who are nice
the woman who was "Another {very slutty} Weeping

how can it be by that they were who is he named

I guess Summer School is back on my calendar.
There was quite a bit of a struggle this first 
semester at UNLV, and it. I'm just really irritated.

you know. handle. before I start freaking out.

what was annoying to me was that she seemed to think 
that I was pretending or something that I wasn't really 
serious that I was making it up or that I was being lazy.
I'm really irritated about that or that I was trying to 
give myself some kind of an advantage by doing whatever it was.

I totally ate all of the so many fried turkeys
                that were hanging out
    by the red wheelbarrow 
                you know the one glazed with
        soy sauce and beside the 
                      kentucky fried 
                             kung pao chickens
           which 
themselves were drenched in
              tabasco sauce

I request neither forgiveness
nor do I intend to apologize for
          my actions 

because 

I spent several hours
of quality time
with a certain young housewife

                    who

braless and dressed in negligee 

          and 

whose wild hair suggested
she spent even more additional
even higher quality time with
both the ice man
and the fish man

       either sequentially 
               or 
              simultaneously 
                     neither would surprise me

left me    breathless    exhausted
as well as      famished

I thought I gave a good
account of myself

but then along came 
          the milkman
and    she             still
   had enough energy 
       for 
    round four

I was there
I saw it all

one of the things I need to do . is clear out must of my . public posts .
This Poem originally Appeared in The Adventures of Chestnut + Hazel # 1
I'm applying for a number of programs as UNLV: the MFA Creative Writing 
Program, the MS Quantitative Finance Program, and the MS Computer Science 
program.

I didn't realize this until just now: each program has a different due date, 
the MFA application is due first, or earliest or whatever, in January.
They are all of the Fall semester of 2024. I have to get the MFA application 
ready before January. I wrote one poem recently, and I really can't remember 
the last time I wrote one:

a lot of things don't . really serve me in a positive . way and it really .
doesn't really help me. You know. I really need to think about the Summer
semester. this really has me a little bit worried. I little bit worried.

1148

Summer school, well. I'm not really passing MIS 768. and when it all 
comes down to it, I'm failing the course in a major way. I was really
hoping that. this would work out. well I think. I think that I was
thinking that I could use MIS coursework as a springboard into computer
science, and I'm not sure if, maybe. Saying something like that is offensive.

1149

change is the way
things go
when the best of all things

turns into a nightmare
and then when the best
of all things goes

well and does not change
and will not be
better than it was before.

1150

Life is such a nightmare right now. 
My expenses have increased, and my 
income has decreased, and I'm really 
not seeing any kind of light at the 
end of the tunnel.

Life is such a nightmare, but 
I'm not sure it's really ever been easy.

1151

change has been
the worst of all
the coins

all the coins 
when taken together
amount to a bunch 
of change

and then I changed the
change the coins
into dollar bills.

1152

when the dogs
are eating all the
dog kibble
it turns into

the worst of all those
things that are the
worst of all

these things and can be
worse than most things

and can be 
better than a 
stick of butter to the face.

1153

I'm trying to think. Today 
is Sunday. I feel like I 
wasted the entire day. In 
fact, it's actually already 
Monday.

1154

how are
these things
that appear in 
my mind when 
i think of 

how things are
not going the way
I would like them
to go when I would

like them to go
better than the way
they are currently
going.

1155

how are
these things
that appear in 
my mind when 
i think of 

how things are
not going the way
I would like them
to go when I would

like them to go
better than the way
they are currently
going.

1156

I feel like there is 
something that I need 
to do right now, but 
I'm not sure what that is.

1157

smile
because you
are

eating a 
whole bunch of
ice cream

you really
are eating
a whole tub
of ice cream!

1158

I was thinking about the aphorism: 
"the hardest part is getting started"

i thought that it was actually a quote 
from Robert Coover's short story "In be 
one night and other brief encounters"

but um it's something people actually say, 
you know, people say that the hardest part 
is getting started.

anyway
the more i thought about it
the more
i thought that

you know
that it could mean two things
on the one hand. it could mean that
the most difficult part in any process is getting the process started

and also
that 

1159

there
was a rabbit crossing
the T's and dotting
his i's and this was what
turned out to be

the best thing he ever did 
other than
eating
that carrot!

1160

I don't really have much to write about. I'm 
writing because. I guess. I want to keep this 
updated, but I really don't have anything to 
write about. I had a few interview over the past 
few weeks, but, nothing has really materialized.

1161

there
was a frog
getting eaten by
a dog

and then there
were other things
that i saw
that

i didn't really
think i really
wanted to see

and it was so scary that
i think i with not
to see it again.

1162

the most difficult part 
of the process is about to 
get started.

i'm working on project 9 for my 
class. i'm almost done.
the hardest part. was actually 
realizing the fact that i have to reference 
my javascript file in the body of my html 
file, and not the head. it was working 
fine, but, um. the 
i'm taking a break.

1163

Where are the times
that the people who
where here
are not here anymore

when they left to the other side of the
universe.

1164

there was .nothing. in the rice pot.
I removed Steam from my taskbar. 
Nightmare. I can't get anything 
done when I get so distracted by other 
useless stuff. This is silly, but I have 
to stay off there. There are other things 
that I could be doing, and should be doing.

1165

The current module in class 
is WordPress. I had trouble, or, 
maybe just hesitation at first, but 
it's actually a whole lot easier than 
I initially thought, so I'm not as 
overwhelmed as I was at first. It's not 
always clear what I'm doing is basically 
my issue with WordPress, but, I almost 
want to say it's the same way when I 
make pages using HTML and CSS to make 
them, it's just that I've gotten more 
familiar creating pages by writing them, 
and grabbing and dragging is somewhat new.

1166

how can you say. that I did not tell you. what you wanted to hear.
What do I have to do? I don't have any major assignments due tomorrow, 
but I have to get these modules on WordPress done because we are going 
to move into new content. [how could you say that I didn't tell you]
exactly what you wanted. to hear what you wanted me. to say when I said.

1167

For some reason I can't seem to really get 
my thoughts together to get very much of my 
course work done. I did get the last two projects 
completed, but only after quite a bit of procrastination, 
followed by quite a bit of pressure from an impending due 
date. I'm not really behind, but I'm not really ahead, and 
I'm not really getting ahead. [there was something changing]

1168

The pressure to land a position is increasing. It isn't 
clear to me where I stand with the temp agency, I did get 
new hire paperwork, but, I'm not sure if that necessarily 
means I have a position, or a paid assignment just yet. I've 
only worked with a temp agency a few other times. Each one is 
kind of different. [there was something that was worse than death]

1169

maybe you say that all thing all
good things are
a waste of time where you

see what these are where
you think that these
are where the pains are

where you say what 
these are where you
think what these thoughts
could do to your brain

where you say that this
is where the wild things
are where you think that

this is where the best of all 
things can be where you think.

1170

Today is the first day in a long 
while that I've been up during the day, where it wasn't, 
where I wasn't just carrying on from the night before. I'm 
still worried about the next few weeks 
and months, since, I'm not working, but I'm not as stressed 
out about it as I usually am, or, as stressed out about it as 
I was a while ago. I almost had an 
interview the other day, but the recruiter never confirmed the 
interview date and time. I thought about just showing up, but then, 
I later thought it would be weird.

1171

there was something there
that I think may have been

and orange turtle or something
that may have been something 

other than what I thought it was
that was other than what I thought

it may have been that was bothering
me in a major way that was silly!

1172

I'm failing MIS 768 in a major way
and as far as I can tell I'll have to 
audit the course and I am so scared about
the future and what will happen to me.
I think that it's all over and that this
is the end of the world basically!

1173

there
was another
one of those things

that I saw that was
something that was 
something that was something
other than what 
I was thinking that was 
new and improved or 
maybe at least not stranger
than what I thought

it was but it was something new and something other than
this but this was something
it was something new it was well I 

you know I have to tell you this is not what I was looking
for it was not what I was looking for
it was actually a whole
lot worse it was a whole lot worse it was a 
whole lot worse it
was so much worse it was
a whole lot worse and I cannot forget it

IT CANNOT BE FORGOTTEN!

1174

how can
i tell you what bad habits I 
have and how often 
I do really lousy things

and how often things are not
really going well and how
often everything

falls right the hell
apart and
when I think about 
the amazing     treasure
              between     your

ears
that fabulous 
mind of yours.

1175

I'm so tired. I don't think that 
I really did anything today. after 
the first application, I went on to 
complete 2 more, and an assessment. 
I went to the buffet around the corner. 
I don't know. I feel like I do the same 
stuff over and over. but oh well. I guess 
that's the way it is for now.

1176

I'm cleaning up 
chestnutandhazel.com right now
and I realize that I actually
used my blog to host photographs
in many cases, so I'm not sure how much
of all of this is going to break down.
this might be a total disaster.

1177

but maybe not as much as a disaster 
as flunking MIS 768!
what a NIGHTMARE!

1178

but where 
were the alligators
and all of
the ambulances

when the disaster
happened when
the disaster
occured when things

did not turn out well
for everyone concerned and
how did everyone fare?
not well!

1179

I need to land a job, and 
I'm starting to worry about 
it. I need something that pays. 
like real money.

1180

I really want to say that all of the 
things that did not go right that
were terrible where all for the chickens!

1181

I really
wanted to tell you
something that you
may have not heard of before
because

well it is a new
thing that
i wanted to tell you

but
you were not listening
and so I could not tell you.

1182

take all of the junk
that is inside
the trunk of your car

and make it into
a new pile of
amazing stuff

and take all of the junk
that is inside your 
garage
and turn it into some
new kind of treasure.

1183

tell me what

tell me what you are thinking about
right now because I am not
able to imagine

what you are thinking or what you
think about when you
stand there looking like you are thinking

1184

I'm trying to get my energy together to 
get myself to work on something, but, I'm 
just not there yet. I'm tired. I usually 
work from maybe 10 PM to early in the morning, 
last night I stopped after being kind of 
discouraged, and then, sort of figured out 
the issue.

1185

and
then there were
things that there

were all these things
and there
were many things

that were major issues
and there were
possibilities

that were quite scary
and there were things
that were really alarming.

1186

It's impossible to get anything 
done during the day. for me anyway. 

I'm about to go to sleep. and I feel 
like my Monday is already gone. total 
nightmare.

Well. it turned out not to be too bad of a 
monday. I went into chinatown and ate a few 
sandwiches. but I am tired, and, most of 
the monday is gone.

1187

get 
away from the
mean 

get away from
the mean meat
carnivorous
animals 

of the jungle of the
plains of the scariest 
places on the face of the earth 
they eat
all the things that there are

and they will not be satisfied with
just eating your flesh they 
will also eat your BONES!

1188

I'm trying to get my energy together to get myself 
to work on something, but, I'm just not there yet. 
I'm tired. I usually work from maybe 10 PM to early 
in the morning, last night I stopped after being kind 
of discouraged, and then, sort of figured out the issue.

1189

this 
is the story 
that was once the

greatest story
known to the kind
of people who enjoy
fabulous stories that are

totally amazing that are even
greater than the most amazing
things that could be told that
could be something that were

even more amazing than the chickens
that were even more totally gone
than taking off all of your chickens.

1190

It's impossible to get anything done during 
the day. for me anyway. I'm about to go to 
sleep. and I feel like my Monday is already 
gone. total nightmare.

Well. it turned out not to be too bad of a monday. 
I went into chinatown and ate a few sandwiches. but 
I am tired, and, most of the monday is gone.

1191

how can you be
such
a total
buffoon?

tell me that much!
I wanted to get in 
touch with you the 

other day but then
I thought that it might
not be the best idea!

1192

see when you are being the best
of all of the worst things
that were totally of all of the worst

thing and you can see that
this is a work of literature
this is a work of great 
genius
even the greatest of all literary
giants will not

write a poem as great 
as this amazing work.
of. literature!

1193

can you be any more
strange could 
you possibly be
any more strange
and this would be the

this would be the time that
I tell you what you say when you 

mean what you say when you say what
you told me the other day when you seem
to think that there was something odd
going on

1194

this could be the best 
thing that ever happened to 
this particular repository
this could be the best thing
that ever happened to this
repository! it might be I might 
tell you I would have to 

Tell you what this is and how this
could be more amazing than the 
best of all things.

1195

I know that there is something
that I should probably be working 
on right now there really is probably something I should be working on 
right now right at this minute.

I can't think of what it is. 
I really can't I don't even remember 
what it is that I should be working on right 
I created an aspect ratio of 8.68 / 6.08
now I know that there is something out there 
that I really should. be working on. right now.

I'm not really in a good mood. I'm tired. I'm cranky. 
I'm worried about the future and all that. This is a headache.
but I'm not really sure what it could be I have not a single 
Idea of what it could. be I know that there is. something that.

I'm super tired. I didn't really do anything today. I attended 
class, which is via Zoom, so, it's not like that's really 
physically demanding, but, I'm otherwise really tired.

something that I need to be doing. but what. exactly is it.
I don't. a little bit of hard stuff. trouble. this is difficult. nightmare.

1196

there was something. that there was everything. and there was bones.
I woke up at around 2 PM this afternoon. I was really tired, so I 
went to the buffet to go out and eat. I bought and drank a few energy 
drinks, but I'm not any more energized or awake than I was 2 hours 
ago, it's 4 PM as I am writing this. I'm thinking about taking kind 
of a long shower or something. doing my homework. - how are you doing?

I think about. how all of this. is actually. 
really silly and something that was nothing 
that could have been very good and could be 
nothing that was the best of all those things 
tell me what you think about all of these things 
that were always. being even more amazing. than this. 

I was bored about all of those things they made me
annoyed and these were how all of those things that 
made me more amazing that made me more silly and I was 
more of a silly guy than any other person who was doing similar stuff!

I had quite a bit of fun with my most recent class assignment. I have 
to figure out what the requirements for the 3rd project, but I think 
that everything that is due tomorrow, all the homework assignments, 
are completed. I also have to get around to filing an appeal of my 
termination, and I have to think about where to apply and how to 
apply for work, and I have to prepare for some kind of thing 
regarding unemployment.

there were all of these. chickens that were. clucking all over.
things are best and all of these things that make it all interesting. 
A nice clean laptop screen is now mine. It's nice. I like it. I can 
really see now. I'm really surprised with how good it looks. I rubbed 
it with rubbing alcohol, and it's really clean, and everything looks 
really visible. Years ago, when I moved to Missouri, I cleaned my 
computer with water, and it fucked things up, and I didn't really have 
money for a new computer for a while. I still get emails from coin 
companies, marketing emails to see if I want to buy anything, and, 
the answer is kind of yes, but for whatever reason, I think that silver 
coins are sometimes bad luck. [you need to smell all of these things]

1198

these make you. still think of all those. things that are.
What did I work on today? well, the course has a kind of 
running project that I'm working on, and that's basically 
what I worked on today. Visually speaking, my fourth version 
of my project, Project 3-4, isn't very different from my 
third version of my project, Project 3-3, but for whatever 
reason it feels like I spent a lot of time doing the things 
that I did manage to do. [what are you waiting for right now]
new and how these. are the best things. and silly to all people.

13 22 90 35 12 19 86 26 31 80 55 33 91 50 53 49
52 32 85 95 26 32 15 45 26 26 14 52 36 25 85 59
06 07 11 13 27 36 26 52 36 01 05 06 08 07 25 85

you can tell me. what all of what you want. what all of what there is.
these can tell you. that all of these things. are better than before.

1199

Quite a bit of stress. There are a lot of things on my mind right now. 
This. is a nightmare. I guess that the only thing that I have to worry 
about is my class, my web development class, and, well, I don't know 
what else. Oh man what a total nightmare. I'm worried. What a disaster. 
What a nightmare. I'm super tired. I applied for something through 
LinkedIn. I want to go do something. Get out of the house, but I haven't 
gone anywhere more than a few blocks away from home. The gas station. 
The other gas station. The grocery store. Such a nightmare. Such a disaster. 
I'm in a lousy sort of garbage mood. I sent out a few resumes and applications 
through LinkedIn, and I've never done that before, so this is new. Life is a 
total nightmare for me right now. I feel so discouraged. I know that I should 
be thinking of things, these difficulties, whatever is going on right now, as 
an opportunity. but I'm really discouraged. [this went the wrong way bad]

1200

Monday and Tuesday are free for me. My birthday is coming up. I haven't 
done anything for my birthday in the longest time. It's just something I 
haven't celebrated in a while. I just can't stop thinking about how everything 
is a disaster right now. a total disaster. I'm really hoping this is all for 
the best. It's just that it might be a while before I'm at that point, where 
I can say this all happened for the best. When my nails are even just a few 
days long, when they've been growing for just a few days, or when I haven't 
cut them for a few days I find that it's hard, or, maybe just awkward, to type. 
It's hard. It's uncomfortable to type when I have just a few days of nail growth. 
Job search. nightmare. I'm worried about these next few months. I'm worried about 
these next few weeks. constantly anxious, and I can't really get my thoughts together.

1201

some of all of these 
more of everything and 
this would. be very. nice.

I'm incredibly tired. I just 
came back from the museum, and 
I went out and did a bunch of 
other stuff as well, but nothing 
major, I just went out to eat. 
and that's it.

smell what. the scented. panties are.
she is wearing punani scented panties 
she always wears punani flavored panties!
Today is my birthday. I booked a visit to 
the natural history museum. I actually 
wanted to go yesterday,  but for whatever 
reason it wasn't available. I wanted to go 
Sunday, but Sunday wasn't an option. maybe 
it's not open on Sunday? who knows. I really 
don't want to go anymore. I'm not really 
feeling okay. I'm experiencing quite a bit 
of anxiety about the future. I don't even 
want to go to the museum today.

1202

can you see how all of this changes
how all of this makes new things more 
amazing than the best of all those 
frogs! the frogs! that ribbit around!
frogs.that ribbit as loud. as any dog.

ribbit - croak - cornflakes make new things
more yummy than your punani flavored panties!

1204

all of the nice people. tell all of the mean people. the meanest things ever.
Somethings aren't going well. for example: I am failing MIS 768! HORRIBLE!
I'm incredibly tired. I just came back from the museum, and I went out and did a 
bunch of other stuff as well, but nothing major, I just went out to eat. and that's it.

1205

you were busy. when i called you. and I had to ask what was up.
Today is my birthday. I booked a visit to the natural history museum. 
I actually wanted to go yesterday,  but for whatever reason it wasn't 
available. I wanted to go Sunday, but Sunday wasn't an option. maybe 
it's not open on Sunday? who knows. I really don't want to go anymore. 
I'm not really feeling okay. I'm experiencing quite a bit of anxiety 
about the future. I don't even want to go to the museum today.

1206

I really had to say something that was not being 
said earlier that there are more than things are

Visual Studio and GitHub. I have to set those two 
things up for my class and coursework. I'm so hungry 
right now. I need to get something to eat.

I went out to eat. I thought about heading to 
Chinatown and finding something to eat there, but, 
I'm just too tired. and at the time I was just too 
hungry. I'm so tired. I hung out last night. In 
retrospect I would have been better just staying 
home. Last night was a disaster.

Well, I have a real desk. This is nice. I'm trying 
to get all my thoughts together, finding focus. I 
like rolling over my 401k into my IRA. I don't like 
switching employers, but I like roll overs. It does 
give me more control and flexibility with things. I'm 
trying to think about worst case scenarios for the next 
few weeks to come, for the weeks and months ahead. One 
thing I don't want to think about are those times with 
things are worse than I thought they would be in a worst 
case scenario.

1207

I was really hungry. so I ate. a whole bunch of food.
What do I do? I got an email from. you know. the 
company that fired me stating that I can request 
an appeal to my termination. I'm going to do it, 
but I have no idea how to approach the whole thing. 
This is a headache. I got my final checks from work, 
or, well, I saw that they were issued today, I didn't 
actually get them, in my bank account or anything. 
I've been spending too much money over the last few 
days, and my spending is something that I really have 
to take down to, you know, something lower than it 
currently is. It's hot, I'm always sweating and I 
always feel somewhat greasy.

1208

there hasn't been many things that have. made me so annoyed. really.
There are a few things in life that are just a little bit too strange. 
Like what? well, I applied for unemployment here in Nevada and I see 
that the last person I contacted for work was. someone. not here in 
Las Vegas, maybe a while ago, but not any more. or maybe. I wouldn't 
really know. I've tried to stay away from that part of town. I don't 
know what to do about the job search. I want to try using LinkedIn to 
look for work. I don't want to do anything too physically demanding if 
I can avoid it. How to stay in shape? I don't really know, I was getting 
fat anyway. [well guess what I am not a total blob a total BLOB FATTY!]

1209

best of all these are. well what I can say. but these are amazing.
can you be more sill could you be any sillier than you have been so far?
but there were all of these things that were all of these things that were
amazing that were too amazing that were too delicious that were too silly.

Updating titles to some of my blog posts, mostly just taking posts that are 
Archived Content posts and shoving them into the nearest series of posts, 
Reflections from Chestnut Street or Letters from Sanford Street or whatever. 
There is the issue of work. I was at two write-ups, and now I'm on suspension. 
I don't know what on earth to do, even if, somehow, I end up keeping my position, 
there is still the issue of things not really becoming easier at work. Things 
just haven't become easier. [but there is all of this and are amazing stuff]

1228

I'm trying to think right now. 
I'm in a strange mood right now. 
I'm irritated about a few things.

there
were all of
those things
that were new
and were totally novel
and were
very amazing

and you said that these
are all of those things
that were all of most things

and she was not happy
because she was needing
some loving, but she
was not getting any loving.

1229

there was something that I
was sure that you were mad
about and you may still be

mad at me for some reason
but I think that you shouldn't 
be mad at me because I have 

been nice to you and you are
testing me out and I think we
should be nice to each-other.

1230

I left work early. That was a 
stupid decision, but, I'm in a 
really bad mood. I'm just in such 
a lousy mood. I went on a block 
rampage. I'm in such a bad mood. 
Really bad mood. I'm resentful 
about so many things. I'm unhappy, 
and angry, and frustrated, and irritated, 
and resentful. I don't know what to do 
about these feelings, or what's causing 
them. I think that I've been able to get 
The Complete Letters from Sanford Street 
to be compliant with the community standards. 
It took a while. A long while.

1231

i think
these were
something else
these were
something new
these were something
where all of those things

can possibly be
and these were needed
but these were not needed

these were amazing and
these were not needed.

1232

I just applied for a position here in Las Vegas, 
and, I'll continue to look for work. I don't think 
that I'll be heading back to Arlington, it just seems 
like it's really not going to happen. I'm putting a 
few other things on the back burner for now. Like 
continuing to work on Chestnut + Hazel, more specifically, 
business registration aspects of it. I tried looking for 
positions at Amazon, but there was nothing available in the 
area. I was thinking that, since it's somewhat easy to 
transfer between locations with Amazon, that maybe I'd get 
in at a location here, and then, if something were to bring 
me back to Dallas / Fort Worth, that maybe I'd transfer back 
there. There's just nothing really in Dallas / Fort Worth, 
though, other than college, and even that was kind of falling apart.

1233

how are all of these things
that you need what do you

need and where are all of those
things that need to be done and 

where are those things
that need to be told to all of those
people who are all of these things

1234

What I'm I dealing with right now? 
I tried withdrawing from the MSQF program 
at UTA, but it's not as simple as clicking 
a button and withdrawing, and dropping out, 
if it was that easy, that's probably what I 
would have done; on the one hand, I don't 
really want to drop out, and on the other hand, 
I don't really see myself going back to the 
Dallas / Fort Worth area.

1235

I really don't see myself ever going back to the 
Dallas / Fort Worth area, but it's possible that one 
circumstance or another might lead me right back there. 
It was one circumstance or another that brought me to 
the Dallas / Fort Worth area in the first place, maybe 
one circumstance or another might bring me back there, 
but I really don't see that happening.

Who knows what could happen between now and 
December? Anything in the universe could happen 
between now and December, and so it might make 
sense for me to keep my options open, and that's 
kind of why I'm seeking "incompletes" for my courses, 
rather than withdrawing from the courses completely 
and dropping out of the MSQF program. 

While I'm here in Las Vegas I should probably find work. 
One of the issues about finding work here in Las Vegas is 
that once I start looking for work and once I start really 
setting myself up here in Las Vegas, it becomes less and less 
likely that I'll return to Dallas / Fort Worth. I didn't really 
have anything going on for me, other than graduate school, that 
was really keeping me in Dallas / Fort Work, and I was facing a 
number of issues in addition to not really being able to get 
anything done in terms of course work and in terms of studying, 
I had a number of problems going on that I really would rather not mention.

1236

some of these || can't be || Butter is not the Answer # 12 || all of these
I did file a copyright for a few of my posts from the Letters from Sanford 
Street series, I used the "Online Literary Works" form, and it was somewhat 
more involved than using the Standard Registration process, but it does allow 
me to have claims on each individual post, rather than having a single claim 
one gigantic series. In this specific case, even though there is a single 
application for the 14 posts that I registered, each post is registered as 
part of a larger registration, using the previous method that I used, I would 
have to compile all the posts into a single post, and then register that single 
post as a "Collective Work" that I'd have a claim on. This distinction probably 
isn't obvious to someone who doesn't register copyrights, but an analogy that 
might make this easier to understand, is that it's like having 14 different 
deeds to 14 different 1 acre plots of land, rather than having 1 deed to a 
single 14 acre plot of land. [how are you I miss you a whole lot and I want]

It feels strange being back in Las Vegas, passing by the city skyline it just seems 
small in comparison to the DFW area. I really only saw the Dallas skyline a hand full 
of times, a few times when I moved to Dallas in 2020, and then, usually each time I 
left the area on a road trip. I feel funny. This feels really weird. Being back here. 
It feels different, it feels really different this time. Being here. Well, guess what 
is on my mind? it isn't popcorn, and it isn't corn on the cob! the only thing that I'm 
thinking about right now is how butter is simply not the answer. [there are times when]

i feel bad for feeling angry. about things that make me. really angry and furious and.
I also set up a mailbox at the UPS Store for my business, Chestnut + Hazel, and, even 
though I'm putting off registering the business in Clark County for the time being, 
I'm sure that I'll come around to it at some point. [how sometimes I feel bad for some]

I have to think about something. I'm just trying to get my thoughts together. I applied 
for a few positions, but just 2, and I'm kind of wondering if I should send out a whole 
bunch right away, of if I should just send out a few here and there. So I applied for 3 
positions today. I really don't know what to do about college. I set up my account for 
handling the student loans I took out for my first semester, but I'll look further into 
it later. There is one position that I saw open that I'm interested in, and, it's kind 
of in the same building that, uh. you know. i don't know. maybe i'll apply there anyway.

1240

how can there be
new things that 
can be more interesting

how can there be
so many new things
that are all of the 

best of all these 
things that were
not going well that

have not been better
than they were before
that were amazing that

were the best that
had been the best that

When popcorn seems like it doesn't have any flavor, 
be sure to taste it first, it might, in fact, taste 
like something, and if it tastes like something, then, 
by definition, it has flavor, even if it's not a very 
exciting one, but be aware: butter is never the answer!

There was stuff here before, and most of it was photographs 
that I collected from various social media sites and apps that 
I collected and posted here, but these things are silly, and 
butter, is still not the answer. [how are you need that this]

When you stare at a baked potato full of sour cream and sprinkled 
with cheese of this or that type, chives, green onions, maybe even 
cilantro; you should be aware of the fact that you are at liberty 
to taste the baked potato, but know this: butter is never the answer!

When you try to put a mushroom in a hamburger and things don't seem 
to be going as smoothly as you anticipated, know that you can use 
whatever you need to use in order to reduce whatever kind of friction 
you happen to be dealing with, use oil, because butter is not the answer.

There are times when butter is in fact the answer, but the circumstances 
where butter is the answer are rare. Suppose you're taking a multiple 
choice test and the question is: what's the answer? If the choices 
include: (A) butter then it's possible that butter is the answer.

The other day I was collecting bottle caps from a trash can in a 
secluded back alley when two men with massive beards approached me, 
attempting to steal my bottle cap collection; the two men were carrying 
large sticks of butter that were sharpened with a butter stick sharpener.

1242

Someone asked me about my clogged arteries and why they're so damn 
clogged up and I just had to respond to this person as directly and 
as honestly as I could, and I straight up told this person the honest 
truth: they're clogged, but butter is not the reason they're clogged.

I just applied for a position here in Las Vegas, and, I'll continue 
to look for work. I don't think that I'll be heading back to Arlington, 
it just seems like it's really not going to happen. I'm putting a few 
other things on the back burner for now. Like continuing to work on 
Chestnut + Hazel, more specifically, business registration aspects of 
it. I tried looking for positions at Amazon, but there was nothing 
available in the area. I was thinking that, since it's somewhat easy 
to transfer between locations with Amazon, that maybe I'd get in at a 
location here, and then, if something were to bring me back to Dallas / Fort Worth, 
that maybe I'd transfer back there. There's just nothing really in 
Dallas / Fort Worth, though, other than college, and even that was 
kind of falling apart. [all things fall apart all things go bad eventually]

1243

Chestnut and Hazel now has a LinkedIn page. Yeah. I didn't 
really do much with the Chestnut and Hazel Facebook page. I 
don't know how much other stuff I should set up for it. This 
is a lot of. stuff. I really. I'm really wanted to start to 
make something of Chestnut + Hazel, and I want it to be more 
than just a blog. I want to keep the blog, of course, but I 
want to make Chestnut & Hazel into something. I have a few 
ideas, but I'm really just not there yet.

The main idea I've come up with is a kind of travel guide. 
Or a road guide or something.

I'm experiencing real dread for the workday ahead. I can't 
believe that I'm already at a second write up in less than a 
month. On the one hand I've honestly been working here, at the 
same company, for longer than I've really work at any company, 
and, I'm honestly kind of interested in maybe doing something else 
but I'm just not really sure what that something else would 
be at this point.

1247

I don't want to be in a desperate position in the event that 
I'm on the job market again. This is a nightmare. A real nightmare, 
and I'm really not ready to start looking again. 

When I think about the things I could possibly do, 
one of the things is working on chestnut + hazel more 
seriously, but like, there's still the very real issue 
of paying whatever living expenses I have to deal with. 
I really don't know what to do, and I don't know what I 
would do. I'm really dreading the moment where I hit 
GAME OVER. Real dread. I don't know what to do, or what 
to look for or how to approach things. The one thing is 
that, last time. The last few times I've applied for work, 
I didn't really have a hard time finding something.

1248

can something be done
can anything be changed
and can anything be sillier
that the places 
that are cool and amazing 

Good lord. I got written up again. 
Write up number 2. I think that it 
was last Monday I was written up, 
then, I worked just a few hours on. 
Okay, so it was last Sunday that I 
was written up, I worked just a few 
hours on Monday, and then took off to 
Salt Lake City. Jeeze, I didn't even 
know I could get written up on the 
basis of four hours of under-performance.

1249

well I should have done something
that I didn't really even get a chance
to do that were always being the best 
of all of these things that were all
of these things that were testing
that were all of these things that
could not be too amazing 

and you can say that these. were most of 
all of these. that were amazing.

Fourteen hours. That's how much time I put in 
this week. So today will put me at twenty-four. 
I had no idea I missed that much work. I feel a 
little bit like garbage. I need to think. I have 
to watch out as far as missing work goes. I have 
enough unpaid time available to use, but of course, 
not enough money.

but what were all those. what were all of these. what were most.
Getting rid of accumulated junk. This and that. When I went on my 
road trip to Salt Lake City, I had some recyclables that I wanted 
to recycle, but, at some point I said: "forget about it" and threw 
it in the trash. Editing this massive Sanford Street post is taking 
a while. I'm doing it little by little, removing anything that might 
be offensive. I'm still not sure how any of this can be an issue, 
since it's all text, and I don't really linger on any particular 
topic for a huge percentage of any given post, so, I really don't 
know how this all got flagged. [how are you doing that these are well]

1250

good lord. I am really tired. and this is taking
an eternity this is really taking forever. this is 
so long taking so long taking forever taking all night.

Right now I don't even want to go into work. Maybe my mood will change, 
who knows. I have a few hours, and I should nap a little more.

Something just slipped my mind. I was just thinking about something, 
and whatever it was, it just slipped my mind. whatever it was. I think 
that I remember now. What I wanted to say is that I want to get back in 
to going to the movies on a regular basis, or seeing movies or whatever. 
I haven't seen any in a long time, and, yeah, I don't know. I don't know 
where to start. I did get a chance to see Oppenheimer, and that was 
basically it. I haven't really thought to keep up with what is going to 
be released and all of that. [tell me something i haven't heard before]

1251

so what is it and. how has all that stuff gone. and how have you said.
that these are the best of the amazing things that you have not done when

Today is Saturday, and I have work later tonight. Class is over and I'm 
going to take a nap. I had a long weekend, especially considering that I 
took 2 days off, in retrospect that was somewhat silly, I could have done 
that later in the week, but, at the same time I was just really in a garbage 
mood, and I don't know, I really had to get out or something, or break away. 
This coming week is going to be kind of long. [when the punani was good]

1252

this is where it all happens. this is where it all changes. this is where.
things do in fact get better, I was so angry before but for some reason i
feel it a whole lot less right now, not right now at the moment not sad.

The work week starts in just 2 hours. I have class, and then work later on 
in the day. I have to continue cleaning up the Complete Letters from Sanford 
Street, I figure that most of what I'm doing is cutting things out, and 
removing things, or whatever, that seems inappropriate, so, that's basically it.

1253

well, can you tell me something. that I don't really even know. that are told.
that were nice. that were smelly. that were even more good and were smelly.

I'm a little bit hungry right now, and I want to eat something. kind of. 
I want to eat something from the gas station. 

I want to see. that there are no new things. that there are all new things.
I feel like going out and doing something. Like real. I feel like going out on a road trip or something.
that there are all these things. that there are all new things. that some things cool.
I don't know what kind of a day this is. Lazy. I'm feeling lazy. and that's pretty much it. 
I'm going to apply for a few more roles. but I don't know what to look for.

This most recent assignment was really cool. I had fun.
that this was not all that great that this was not all
that amazing that were not all that scary that were something.

but these could tell you new things. that were smaller than. you are cool.

but. i no longer really have a business address. i want to feel validated.
I thought she was nice and she was very beautiful and I wanted to ask her.

1254

how has all of this. been when the worst. people are they are nice.
It was funny because, when I saw him months later at a new company, 
I asked him what this issue was, why, you know he was at a new company 
and all that. For me, I was looking for a second job, but I already had 
a second job, and I think, most employers aren't too open to any given 
employee having two job and all that, at least, not for very long anyway. 
Anyway, about the old friend, I asked him what the issue was, and he said 
he said something, and I said to him, you know, it's funny that you should 
say that, because, I happened to be thinking the exact same thing.

Something like. I remember ordering something like 2 large appetizers, 
they were large enough for 2 people, and, for some reason the waitress asks 
if I want an entrée anyway. So I ordered one, but I was already really stuffed. 
I ate everything, but I really was super stuffed. I didn't know what to do. I was 
stuffed, like a turkey. I'm on thing ice right now. 2 write ups, and now I'm on 
suspension. I'm afraid about the potential for tough times ahead. I'm afraid about 
the future. I want to be at a point where I can say: everything turned out for the best.

1255

There were times when things really did get better, and when it seemed 
like I was on the right path. sometimes it feels like a good future is 
so far away, and so far out of reach. and something that will just never 
happen. and something that will just never materialize. and something that 
is just for people who have connections, and something that is just for 
people who have all the right social skills. and sometimes I think that 
maybe I should make more friends. I made one friend, and we exchanged 
contact information. Sometimes friendships go stale by the time I need a 
letter of recommendation. sometimes connections drop by the time I need a 
letter of recommendation. 

Coincidences skill seem to pop up from time to time, and sometimes I'm not 
really sure what to make of them. Sometimes there is this thing or that thing 
and some connection between the two, and I don't really even want to go into 
details, I really don't even want to get into the specifics of this or that 
thing. I just don't. I really don't. When she says that coincidence makes 
sense only with you, what I wonder is does she mean the coincidence seems 
to make sense only when someone, whoever she is talking to, explains the 
coincidence as more than a coincidence, or does she mean, that the person 
who she is talking to is able to accept a coincidence as a coincidence without 
thinking more of it. two thirty two. ninety six. four four three. I'm probably 
just seeing things.

1256

I am really tired right now and 
this is really taking forever and 
I don't even know if I am really dying 
right now really dying right now.

1257

these can be nice. these can be great. these can be.
I'm really not feeling okay. I'm not feeling okay at 
all. Things are not going well. I was kind of making 
a little bit of progress not too long ago, but now, I 
think I'll be facing kind of a set back. Nightmare. 
over and over. I'm not happy. I'm unhappy. Everything 
is kind of a disaster. Everything is kind of a nightmare. 
The clock is officially ticking, and I have no idea what 
on earth to do. I feel like pure garbage.

1258

everything that everyone does. is really nice. and irritating.
I left work early. again. and again it wasn't really a good idea. 
not the end of the world. but not a good idea. I'm just not really 
feeling happy. I feel like pure garbage. I'm just in a persistent 
unhappy mood. With all the time I've missed I might as well have 
gone on another road trip. When I looked at my time card I didn't 
realize that I left so early. I thought I worked 2 hours at least, 
but, it was really only an hour an a half. I drink so many energy 
drinks every day. I don't know why I'm in such a bad mood all the 
time. I'm either angry, or depressed. over and over in circles.

1259

Feeling lost. I have no idea what to do. I kind of want to go back to 
college. One of the few things that I enjoy is the Software and Web 
Development course that I'm taking, it's expensive, and I don't really 
think I'd be doing this unless it was an employer paid benefit, but I 
think I kind of want to check out what's offered at one of the community 
or junior colleges in Las Vegas.

So even if I'm somehow able to work through all my remaining shifts for 
the week, it will only put me at about 31 or 32 hours worked for the week. 
Huge mistake to cut out of work, but, sometimes my brain, my mood, just 
has to get away. I couldn't concentrate during class, and I'm having trouble 
concentrating now.

1260

there have been. things that were. all amazing.
there was nice things between the oranges laying 
on the porker such a porker and I thought she was 
a total porker. such a porker. such a total porker.

Some things are just too weird. some coincidences 
are just too coincidental. sometimes things line up 
in strange ways that seem. weird. like i wonder how 
that happened. [such a total porker and porker porker]

1261

but there were a lot of things. that were really nice. that were amazing.
Version 4 - 7 of my project is responsive. It fits mobile screens.
there were a lot of these. things that were said. that were evil.

I was able to find something to eat.
there had been things that were silly
there were. all kind of things. that happened.

It's midnight and I'm really kind of hungry. 
I want to go out to eat, I want to find something to eat.

don't tell me. what I think about. how I think about it.
and how there are things that been told and said and talked about

I don't really have much to write about. I've just 
been working on my coursework and assignments and 
projects for my class. I've been basically goofing off 
with this Jennifer Connelly project. All day, and a few 
hours from the previous day. I think that I worked 
overnight on this.

1262

I don't know why I didn't but more sodas when 
I was at the gas station earlier. Right now 
I'm more thirsty than I've ever been. So thirsty.

Guess what? I drank water! it was so good.
I'm in a weird mood.
Everything is kind of a nightmare right now. 
like a real nightmare. I wish things we easy. 
or at least. easier.

One thing I made easier for myself is to keep 
my keyboard backlight on. this is nice. since 
I'm always up at night. during the day, though, 
I'm always working kind of in the dark.

What do I still want? Like. Is there anything 
I still want that I've wanted for a while.

1263

where all you. see what you need. there are all.
these things that you need what the best are all.

I submitted 1 application today. i think one of 
the things that kind of makes me nervous is when 
there are a number of programs or applications 
listed in the post that I'm not familiar with. A 
lot of these positions, or, at least the positions 
that stick out to me, have to do with casino games, 
or slot machines.

1264

how are all of these. these are all of these. and you need.
what all of this is and how all of these need that see
I need to look for work, and I need to find something, 
I need to land something. I feel a little bit worried. 
well. I actually feel a little more than just a little 
worried. I haven't looked for work or applied for a job in  
a while.

test more things. and see if they. work out and how they.
all work out and how all things work out and how all these
these were all of these things and these need to be and 

1265

when all of those things that goes to the hinges
that are all of these things that meet the things 
that all of these mark off the best of all of these things 

that perhaps the person could be the best and the things 
that make all of these things and how these things that 
need to be changed that can be too amazing that become 

too silly that become too new that become the changes that 
need to be make and will always be made for all of these 
things that you cannot be changed that cannot be silly.

I missed my appointment with my career counselor the other day, 
and I was so tired, that I didn't show up for class, even though 
it was just a Zoom session. Same thing, I was playing Sim City, 

and that was an issue, and the other thing was that I was staying 
up late trying to set up my GitHub website, it took forever, and 
the issue turned out nothing that I was able to fix, the issue was 

that my account was messed up, so I had to create a new account. I 
don't know what the specific cause of the issue was, but as far as 
I can tell, it had something to do with the email address that I used 

to sign up for an account. It's less likely to get flagged if you use 
something like a signup with a Gmail account. So that's what I did, 
the other issue may have been with my account name, which had hyphens. 
and it was really long as well.

1266

there are no things. that can be the best. that can tell all.
when she opened her legs I saw everything I really needed to see.

I've been wasting a little bit of time playing Sim City. Well. 
It's actually a lot of time that I've wasted playing the game. 
I've been in an unhappy mood these last few days, and I'm not 
really in any position to do anything super interesting. My fortune 
cookie the other day. I went out for Chinese food. Said: There are 
no bad journeys, only lessons learned. I don't know if that was 
supposed to encourage me or what.

1267

and I found out all I needed. to find out it was great. and tasty.
needing more money and needing more changes and needing more things.
but all of these will be that will tell us all that will smell nicer.

I'm feeling a little better than I was earlier. I've applied for a few more 
roles. a few more positions. I'm worried about things. about the next few months. 
I'm annoyed by how often. like. my plans to get ahead always seem to hit a brick wall. 
things just aren't really easy for me. this is such a headache. such a disappointment. 
I'm feeling somewhat discouraged.

1268
 
but I didn't want to insult. you in any way. and all of these things that are great.
yet all of these things that were amazing that were really all that great that things.

1269

something was wanted. and too many things were needed. and how all of these things.
you have permission to lick whatever you need to lick and it has a flavor similar
to fresh punani and when you lick whatever you need to lick you will see what I was.

My head is in a million different places right now. I'm in such an absolute funk right now.
there was all of these things that were testing the best of all of these things that

1270

changes that. can be made and will tell you. that these are the things that are all.
but you know how it all goes and how it all is told to those people who are not liked.

I have my hearing today. yet another nightmare. I'm frustrated right now. Irritated.
can these things be the told how the sea and the wind can all be the new things now. 

I managed to get my project finished, although, not without a lot of procrastination. 
For some reason I keep getting sucked-in to playing computer games. Huge waste of time. 
Today is after Labor Day. I had an interview with a temp agency and a logistics company 
the other day, but, I don't know where I stand. I'll follow up when I get a chance.

I get less and less enthusiastic about this blog as time goes on. Well, maybe that's 
not totally true. I guess. I just really have less time for it right now.

1271

she said that I am. not interested. but I am interested.
so I don't know what she was really talking about there was.
a lot of ice cream and a whole lot of things to eat that were good.

I'm getting worried about coming up on a second month out-of-work. I didn't get approved for 
unemployment, so, I'm basically just staying home for now. Not doing anything other than my 
course work and. I did a little day trading yesterday, but, it didn't amount to much. I didn't 
lose anything, and that's always good.

Caffeine keeps me up, but it doesn't give me motivation. I've been procrastinating with some 
of the stuff for class. [but the punani was amazing and I loved it I don't know what else to say]

1272

can there be new things. can there be old things. can thing be changed.
Today is labor day and I've stayed up overnight, and I haven't had any 
sleep, and I haven't got any work done.

can there be things that. are things that are great. and there are all these.
I should be starting a new position soon. Thank god. I've been bored out of my 
mind, and kind of losing focus. it's been about a month and three weeks.

there can be these. things that are needed. and are wanted for everything.
that they are that they really all are that could be the best of all things.

I'm so tired. My sleep cycle has shifted over the past few weeks. I'm still 
worried about not landing a position yet. I'm depleting my savings, and for 
me, that's not really ideal.

1273

confirm attendance at appeal
tell everyone what a loser you are 
and how you. are such a total. total loser.

I still haven't landed a position yet, and I'm 
under a little bit of stress as a result. I can't 
believe I didn't get approved for unemployment.

1274

this is a dialogue. between two people. who don't know.

best of all the places you've been
are better than the places you haven't been.
and you won't go anywhere new for the foreseeable future.

now and then you will
find something interesting.
and most of all they are more interesting
than the things that you haven't come across.

and you will drive across the country and find new things
that are interesting
and that you will be happy to see and 
you will enjoy them.

I know what to do now, like going forward and stuff. I'm going to say this:

1275

"Yeah, I know a whole bunch of stuff, all the craziest dirt and everything. 
Basically. I have all the information you need, even the things that other 
people don't know, and even the things that other people couldn't even imagine."

maybe you know the things that you haven't
already learned so you will learn them.

here
and again
you see it over and
over and think that
the new things are
nonsensical, but they
actually make sense.

1276

before I really. before I left Arlington, Texas, I had this really
amazing collection of stamps. that were used. to send letters.
I really thing hand cancelled stamps are a lot nicer than machine 
cancellations. so much nicer and a whole lot more amazing yeah.

but before I left. there was a whole issue of. reducing my posessions.
so I tossed everything into the trash, and that was something of a disaster.

I kind of blew off one of my professional development projects, the last 
one, but I didn't realize that it was required for passing the course, 
so I requested a redo of that project.

1277

and then there. was something that. thought that it was amazing.
these were where they end of the roads began and all of the people 
there were monsters who ate all of the frogs and ate all of the chickens 
who ate all of the turkeys who ate all of the peanuts and all of them

One of the issues I have with what I post on chestnutandhazel.com is that It's hosted, or whatever, it's really just an account
on blogger.com, so since it's basically a social media account, I have to comply with the community guidles of blogger.com, and
since I have adsense active on that page, I also have to comply with any adsense advertiser standards, so I have my hands tied 
in many respects. chestnutandhazel.com continues to get flagged over and over and over, and in many cases I don't really want to 
deal with it right away.

the other issue is that I also have to post what I write somewhere, so that I can use the standard copyright registration form,
rather than the unpublished copyright registration form, so, that's another issue. so you know, it's kind of whatever.

can they sell are they mean. but they did not and they could not. see the beginning.

I'm feeling incredibly scatter brained. I have a project due for my software and 
web development course today, and I haven't even started. This should be simple, 
so I'm not too worried about it, but, at the same time, I know from the past that 
these things could take quite a while if I hit a brick wall.

There are other issues that I'm facing, especially on the income front. The temp 
assignment was not a particularly good fit, and, I really get the feeling that I 
should avoid any kind of warehouse or factory work, even though, that's sort of 
what I've been doing for the past five years, but I don't have the slightest clue 
what to look for.

Life is such an unbelievable struggle. I don't really know what to do about money. 
Somewhere in the back of my mind there's this voice telling me that I should stop 
looking for a job or employment or whatever, and, that I should focus on trying to 
make money doing stock market shit.

all they wanted were. everything in the chains. all of the starts and the ends.

Reflection # 714 by Chestnut and Hazel

I don't know exactly what I've been spending on buying lunch and soda at work, 
but I know that it is too damn much, I want to say it is around 15 dollars per day. 
Too fucking much. I have to cut down on that for sure.
By Chestnut + Hazel at June 11, 2019 

Notes written on 10/10/2023 @ 10:19 AM, originally posted on GitHub
I think that I wrote this post while I was working at Case New Holland. I'm surprised that I was really spending that much. I 
Wonder what I was buying? I don't really remember. I think that it was mostly energy drinks. I don't remember my exact hours. 
It was overnight is as much as I remember. In Cameron, MO there isn't really much to eat if you're up at odd hours.

I'm working on Project 11 for my Web and Software Development course. I'm not really getting much done. I'm getting sidetracked
with other things. I'm really amazed that I get so little done, especially considering that I've had few other obligations other
than class these past few months. I really wonder what I've been doing.

Earlier in the course I would have a lot of fun playing around with our daily assignments, but, I haven't really done that in a
while, even though there have been plenty of opportunities to do so.

"The Young Woman who is the Post Office" (2022)

The rural carrier associate is a 
young woman with a lisp that lingers
long enough to wreck your week, and
fiery jade eyes that burn in your
mind every subsequent week.

I try to buy stamps, twenty is too much for
one stamp, and she can't break bills, and
I can't have them all, I ask to trade stamps,
one for one, she's not sure that's okay,
so she phones a friend; she asks
if I have exact change and I say:
yes! I do.

1282

I'm really stressed out right now. I'm trying to
clean up my blog. I'm trying to clean up chestnutandhazel.com
because it really just seems that when it comes to struggles 
in life, people just aren't really all that sympathetic.

if you have problems 
they are all your own fault.
I think that it's still important to think about 
and reflect on them, but, I don't think these thoughts 
really need a huge audience.

1283

some of the things are really. almost out of my control.
some things just I really have no control over.

1284

I think that it really is kind of nessecary to send out 
back into the world whatever it was that the world hit you
with. Send out whatever you get in.

"This Is Just To Say Something About The Young Housewife" (2023)

I totally ate all of the  so many    fried turkeys
that were hanging out
by the red wheelbarrow
you know     the one glazed with
soy sauce and beside the 
                      kentucky fried 
                             kung pao chickens
           which 
themselves were drenched in
              tabasco sauce

I request neither forgiveness
nor do I intend to apologize for
          my actions 

because 

I spent several hours
of quality time
with a certain young housewife

                    who

braless and dressed in negligee 

          and 

whose wild hair suggested
she spent even more additional
even higher quality time with
both the ice man
and the fish man

       either sequentially 
               or 
              simultaneously 
                     neither would surprise me

left me    breathless    exhausted
as well as      famished

I thought I gave a good
account of myself

but then along came 
          the milkman
and    she             still
   had enough energy 
       for 
    round four

I was there
I saw it all

1285

those things could not go well.
but you might think that things.
are not great but they are nice.

I'm tired. What do I have due today? 
I have a few class assignments and a 
Project due. I've been working on the 
project for days, and I've had a really 
hard time with it. I'll insert a few 
iframes below.

the boobs were nice and so 
were the boobies [very nice boobs!] 

anyway, I'm kind of lost and don't really 
know what to do, i need to go over this 
course material. I don't know why this 
most recent project has monopolized my 
time. I got tied down with front-end aspects 
that had almost nothing to do with the 
assignment, and I'm irritated about it.

1286

My new restart version of project 14 did 
not go as well as I thought it would have 
gone. I don't know what to do. I'm in a 
bad mood. 

There are two things that I'm thinking about 
doing, forking project 14 version 2 to start 
project 14 version 3, making one more attempt 
at the iframe carousel, and then getting the 
JSON and asynchronous stuff into project 14.

the other idea is going back to project 14 
version 1 and just shoving the 2 additional 
things into it, it's a mess, but it works, 
and the cleaner version 2 doesn't work.

Irritated.

1287

Veggies were on the plate
and I ate all of the veggies
most of the veggies anyway

some of the veggies were 
cooked and some of the veggies
were raw. I don't want to think

about that again. it was a horrible
experience and I don't want to
think about it again.

[trying to move all of this stuff into a single file and]
Introduction [I'm just thinking about how long all of this]
[is going to take, one hundred years maybe this is a nightmare]

These are notes taken while living in Arlington, 
Texas on Sanford Street. I lived on Sanford Street 
from June 2020 to October 2022. This is currently 
in the process of being edited. These posts are a 
mix or journal entries, reflections and introspections, 
thoughts, stream of consciousness writings, and just a 
general mix of thoughts, worries, and plans for the future.

1289

Bored, work starts later. bored. and i have no idea what to do. 
do you ever wish that things turned out differently. and can you 
think of a time when things turned out differently than you would 
have hoped them to turn out with the pancakes and the organizers 
of the best of the could you see that horse in the distance, upon 
whom a warrior sits. i am jealous of this and i am jealous of that 
and i would have liked for things to have gone my way.
The above block of text is potentially unintelligible 
and completely incoherent.

1290

I'm dealing with no small
nightmare right now. this is 
really no small nightmare

I don't know where to begin 
there are a bunch of different
things all going wrong at the same time.

1291

I might think about how most
incoherent remarks are made.
and it's not a fabulous story.

Good lord. I'm feeling it again. How long does 
this sort of thing last. Forever maybe. Or maybe 
just a while. Or who the hell knows 

this file will go on until the end of time, and
it's not a happy story.

I don't feel secure budget wise. The overtime 
helps quite a bit. But who knows how long it will last.

when the bees
are buzzing and the honey is being made.

I'm just going to go ahead and 
put all these posts up. 
I mean I'm going

to upload all the Submittable
content that I downloaded to my computer
and upload it to my blog.

There has to be more to life
than this
boring ass shit that

I have allocated to me.
There has to be.

The main goal for the next. I guess
however the fuck long.

Okay. Let's make it definite.
I want to put out a copyright before the end of
October, but of course. I want to get
it done sooner than that.

The other goal is to figure out what
to do about the Graduate School Question.

I don't even know what
I'm thinking about right now.

This is an incoherent remark.
What you are about to read
is an incoherent remark.

Things that have been going on
are not all what they seem to be
things are not all the same and things
that happen do not always make sense

what you read was an incoherent remark
and if you continue to read this
note, then you will probably
read additional incoherent remarks

written by none other than Kenneth the Frog
who had at one point wanted to be a prince,
but his princely application was deemed
not acceptable by the princess to whom he
had sent his frog to prince application, but

maybe.

1292

oh jesus
I removed
the whole things

what a nightmare
I didn't really intend
to do that!

I can't really fix this right now
because I have something
else to fix!

1293

Well. That was an incoherent thought and
an incoherent remark as well. Please disregard
that note and please do not take it too seriously
or it will become the interpretation of things
that are not quite as they seem, nor are they
the actions of an entirely sound of mind
individual. You know that there are things
that do not.

1294

there were people there and they all seemed to be
nicer than the people on the other side of the train
tracks were the other people spent most of their time.

Reflect on the person to deny the obvious, that
I do in fact tell you every day that you are the one
person who eats all of the chickens five to ten times
a day and does not debone the chickens because the 
chickens do not in fact have any of the bone you speak of.

Incomprehensible Odes 
are things you can read
but never really understand.

and then you get 
fried. rice.

Breakfast and Lunch
was better than dinner and
supper, and that is no joke.

I really think
that she was smelly
in a good way!

1295

moving all of this around is such
a nightmare and such a headache and
I think that this is the most 
biggest nightmare I've had to deal with
in a while and a real headache!

For breakfast we had Life cereal which
we had for breakfast a few days ago.
Like I had said yesterday I would ditch
the Life cereal for an ounce of blow.

For lunch we had a bologna sandwich
with cheese and mayonnaise, it was quite good
but the bread was a little soggy which
made the sandwich put me in a bad mood.

I don’t know what we are going to have
for dinner today: if it were up to
me it would be fried rice or chow mein save
the vegetables, which I hate through and through.

The meals today have been O.K. so far,
for dinner I want something quite bizarre.

You can tell me what the future holds for
me and honestly. I wouldn't believe you.

1296

these chickens
turned into new

chickens and they told 
everything to the people
who were there before

and these chickens
interacted with all
of those ducks!

1297

how can it be
when the new things
collect dust

and the old things
rust and they 
seem to talk

from a distance where
all of those new things
turned into gold

while the silver
started to rust
or when the silver
started to oxidize! 

1298

I think about all 
the different kinds 
of headaches I have 
to deal with
right now and most
of those headaches

have something to do
with a woman named
well. I shall not
name any names
and she shall be

the woman who
shall not be named.

1299

she has a really 
nice punani, but
that is as much

detail as I can
provide. she otherwise

shall not be 
named!

so. if you've 
seen the punani 
and you've 
tasted the punani 

and you've 
you know 

then you might now 
exactly who I am 
talking about! 

but [she]
SHALL NOT BE NAMED!

1300

there are different
aspects of a woman
that can drive a 
a person crazy 

one [her personality]
and two [her punani]

1301

I can't really deal
with all of this right now 
it really is getting 
out of control.
A Series of Logos for Chestnut + Hazel

1302

summer school is basically 
back on the table.

I was reluctant to sign up.
but then an opportunity 
presented itself.

here is the issue.
I'm failing MIS 768!

and there are two ways to
approach this.

one, take summer school
and maybe this will boost
my transcripts.

or hold off, and wait 
for the fall semester

and spend the summer strategizing
the fall semester.

truth is, i'm not sure 
how much of a strategist I am.

I might end up spending the 
whole summer thinking about punani.

1303

at this age. and I'm an old man 
at this point, but at this age.
I just really thought that punani
wouldn't be something that was on 
my mind all the time, but it is!

1304

The Chestnut + Hazel Logo is complete, 
not because I think that it has achieved 
perfection, but because I'm just not going 
to work on it anymore. I'm going to register 
a copyright for all of the attempts, and the 
one that I'm going to use as a logo is the 
one I'm going to register the trademark for.

how all of this turns into a game where
the people with more oranges produce more 
orange juice than the peoplw with tangerines!

1305

So that's it, that's the Logo, that's the trademark. 
I'm done, and again, I don't think that it's prefect, 
but it's at a point in it's evolution, and I'm at a 
point in my energy levels where I think I'm 
going to leave it here.

Well, I guess I'll leave it there for now, one of the 
issues is that I completed the paperwork to register a 
copyright for The Complete Letters from Sanford Street, 
and it needs to be published somewhere, so I have to 
leave it there, in it's more or less existing condition 
before starting to edit it and all that. I'm not sure 
what's so sensitive about it, since is strictly text.

but there were all of these things that got in 
the way and there were so many impediments that
it was nothing less than a total nightmare

1306

there are two aspects of a woman that 
can drive you crazy:

one: her personality
two: her punani

1307

I don't know what to do about this.
This is such a long post, and going 
over everything is going to take an 
eternity. This could take a long time 
to edit. This is a nightmare. This is 
all text and I could swear that there 
is nothing totally unusual here.

1308

I'm continuing to work through The Complete Letters from Sanford Street, 
removing anything that I think violates the community standards. Even 
if I didn't have to deal with Blogger, I still have to deal with AdSense, 
so I might as well do all of this.

1309

I'm getting ready to finish some work that I've been working on for the 
past few days. As far as going on another road trip goes, to Utah or Idaho, 
that's really something that's going to have to wait. I signed up for overtime 
next week, and, that's not really going to leave any free time for me, I 
signed up for two quarter shifts, and then half shifts were later offered, 
but I couldn't take them because I had already taken the quarter shifts.

1310

and they were just so long ago, ancient history

Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner
For breakfast we had raisins in oatmeal
and a cup of coffee that was too dark
the meal was O.K. but it did not feel
like it was enough, not hitting the mark.
For lunch we went to Jack in the Box where
I had eight tacos and a Jumbo Jack
The meal was way too fucking much I swear,
I think I should ask for my money back.
For dinner we had chow mein and fried rice:
the chow mein had too many vegetables
and the glass of water had too much ice.
I would have much preferred weed edibles.

1311

That is everything I ate for today,
I'd eat even more if I had my way.
I understand that she wouldn't want to 
talk to me, or even want to hear from me.
There are plenty of people that I feel that
way about.

And. I guess I'm feeling the other side
of this. I wonder why. I'm cursed.
What offense have I committed?

I was up most of the day. I went to get pizza. I played Civilization 6. 
I really only play Civilization 6 as Phillip the Second of Spain. I left 
work early yesterday. I capped out on Paid Time Off, but for how long? I 
have no idea. I hope I didn't cap out for the year. The allocation is about 
2 hours per week, so it's been about 40 hours I've used, and that sounds 
about right, but I'm surprised that I've used it all already.

but there were people who.
when added together became.

I don't take very many pictures. I haven't taken very many pictures ever, 
but I guess I just haven't been anywhere new, or, maybe I just haven't

just letting you know of his existence
forty-thousand years before anyone
would find it. His primary subsistence
was on meat and he hunted with no gun,

just his bare hands and with a wooden spear
that he would throw deftly with precision
falling elk, antelope, bison, and deer
blood flowing from the point of collision.

"I was here," he says, "and I hunted these
animals through the jungles and the trees."

1317

This is the way it goes. and this is the way it will always be.
changes that were turned into new rules that were made into. 
whatever it turned out to be whatever it smelled like whatever. 
it became whatever it seemed to be and it was not whatever it likes.

Anyway, I'm blank right now. I can't really think about. I can't really 
figure out what to do. I don't really know what I would do in the event 
that I had to, or would have to look for a new job. I really don't. I 
don't really even have a resume. I think. I haven't really been motivated 
to look for anything new, and I haven't really been interested in looking 
for anything new.

Before I left Arlington I applied for and received an offer for an 
outside sales role. I don't know if it's still referred to as outside 
sales. I didn't take it because it would have. I wouldn't have been 
able to go to college and work. The scheduling wouldn't work. That 
one incomplete semester set me back ten thousand bucks, and, in 
retrospect I probably should have taken the job. I remember seeing 
their headquarters building in Nashville during that first road 
trip through the Midwest. I can't really do anything this year. 
I'm so damn far behind.

Yeah, I don't really know what I would do if I had to start looking 
for work again. I did take a look the other day, but, I didn't send 
out any applications, and, no resumes since I don't have one. There 
was one opening that really caught my eye, but I kind of just want 
to stay where I'm at and see what develops. If I were to get canned 
I'll just take it as an opportunity to try something new.

then when they come to the basket seller 
they start to buy baskets the ones that are. 
nice and the ones that appear amazing and.
the ones appear so cool of the most best kind.

How are you doing Kenneth?
Not well, everything is a catastrophe, I'm basically failing, 
like usual, and can't really seem to get it together.

Why are you failing, Kenneth? and why is everything a catastrophe?
It's your fault! in fact, I think that from now on, I'm going to think 
of you as katastrophiena! Anyway, hyperbole aside, I'm legitimately 
not doing well, things aren't too much of a catastrophe, but they 
are more or less a total disaster. I'm serious.

I'm amused.
Yeah, well, I don't really know what to do.
Why do you figure it out.
Yeah, that's probably not going to happen. 
I'm really never going to figure this out.

1322

there were things that seems to tell
the people who saw it that there was
something new and that was something
that challenged the existing way of

doing things that challenged tradition
that challenged how people wanted to
think about things that were amazing.

I haven't had a lot of time to do anything 
lately. maybe. maybe this is my opportunity 
to do something different.

tell me what you * want to hear about - about * they 
are what you want to think * about when you see what 

I remember something funny. I remember, when 
I was working at Amazon, I applied for a position 
that one of the managers though I was underqualified 
for, so he gave me a hard time about it. I went to. 
I guess. The manager of all the managers at the site, 
and tried to clarify that I was just kind of. I guess. 
Trying to amuse myself by applying for one of the most 
awesome positions in the company that I could think of, 
and that I usually do this sort of thing when I'm 
unemployed, but I haven't been unemployed for the 
longest time, so I figured I would just do it anyway.

1323

see what * there is there what * there was there and * did
I didn't know that there was an election on 05/07/2022. 
I was asleep, and I didn't find out about it until the day after.
and what they * want and what they * need to see * where they went.

1324

if you don't know. then you clearly don't know. about it or anything.
It's lunchtime, and I'm not hungry, and I don't know why. I'm just not hungry.
I missed a sign up for overtime this week, so I have 3 days off, but there is honestly 
nothing interesting that I can do with that time. My courses start soon, so preparing 
for that is about as interesting a thing as I can do with my days off.

1325

there was money inside. the left pocket of the. place where they went.
There weren't any breakfast burritos available when I went to the gas 
station this morning, so I bought a soda and that was it. but you know.

and you can see what. they make when they. see.
I'm in the worst mood ever. I feel like garbage.
how they all went to the place. where the things.
how all of the people who seem to be nicer than others.

My phone still doesn't really have a good connection at 
my new work location. This is frustrating because sometimes 
I want to write or read while I'm in my car. I get almost 
no connection anywhere in North Las Vegas. well there you are!

1326

I bought cigarettes. Twice. After telling myself that I want 
to quit smoking. I don't know what to do. It was lunch, and 
the gas station is just around the corner. So I bought some.

I continue to struggle with bouts of really intense unhappiness. 
It comes and goes and I'm not always sure where it comes from. 
It's usually over things I shouldn't really be bothered by.

1327

see what the women. look like when. they remove all their clothes.
Well, I bought a pack of cigarettes. I didn't mean to do that, 
but after this pack of cigarettes, I will definitely stop smoking. 
Tomorrow, Saturday, is the last day of the pay period, but the first 
day of the work week, I have the rest of today off, and I don't go 
in until 6:00 PM tomorrow. I don't know what it is, but even when I 
drink soy milk I get a stomach reaction similar to when I drink 
regular milk. Like: "come on stomach, this is just soy milk!"

1328

I can't really attend school without 
working right now. it doesn't really make
sense to be in school without working right now.
It's just something that I cannot do and will 
not do, it was something I had done before and 
it was not really worth it and it set me back in
a major way.

1329

there were a whole. bunch of things that. did not make.
any sense to me because they were completely non-sensical 
I have to stop smoking, and I want to stop smoking.
they did not make. any sense and were. non-sensical.

Sharing or posting pictures on Blogger isn't ideal. 
The issue has to do with sizing. I need to manually 
adjust the sizes of pictures I post here to 600 pixels 
otherwise they overflow out of the margins.

I really want to stop smoking. I can't figure out why 
I'm so fatigued, sluggish, and tired all the time, other 
than that I smoke, and that I'd probably be more fit if 
I wasn't smoking. and your thoughts became my thoughts.

1330

there were all of these things that made it seem like. 
noting would ever be more boring than whatever it was.
that she was talking about in the best part of the story.

It feels like it has been a long week so far. I know that 
I shouldn't wish my life away, wishing the weeks and days 
and hours would go by faster, but I'm really stuck for the 
time being. distractions. diversions. I can't think of anything, 
and then again, I don't really want to do anything.

1331

there was something more interesting that I was thinking about. 
other than whatever it was that she was talking about that was. 
something more amazing than whatever it was that she was saying.

I want to buy some jeans, but I really have more pants than 
I need, and I also have enough jeans as it is, I think. So I 
guess I'll think that one over. I don't know. Some of my pants 
are too long. The length of my pants usually isn't an issue 
when I wear boots, but sometimes I wear sneakers, so, sometimes 
my pants drag across the floor.

1332

but I was angry about the whole situation how everything was.
just really making my annoyed and irritated as thought it was.
designed to be annoying and horrible and designed to irritate me.

I feel a little better. It seems that as soon as I wrote down 
that I was feeling sad, the feeling sort of dissipated. I felt 
like leaving work early, but, the most intelligent thing to do 
is finish out my shifts in full this week. I'm amazed by how 
long this week has felt so far, I still have one more day left 
of the work week, and, not really because I signed up for over time.

The most intelligent thing I can do is not leave work early.
I've kind of made a breakthrough with paying down my credit cards, 
it's not a major one, but I'll be able to accomplish, a kind of, 
full churn of the balances while reducing my total outstanding 
balances. This isn't a major breakthrough, but it's a breakthrough, 
and, I think that I should be happy about that. There is this kind 
of strategy or tactic where, I focus my payments on a specific card, 
and concentrate my spending on a specific card, and kind of rotate 
spending and payments during the month. [how are you doing right now]

1333

I have work today, but only about half a 
shift. I'm somewhat glad. I was really tired.

well I don't know I think I didn't get. as easy.
a version of the exam that you did. I think that
I got a harder version of the test than you did!

I continue to experience this really intense 
feeling of unhappiness. I don't know what it is. 
It hasn't gone away. [so there we are I got it harder]

1334

so there we are
I've figured it out
we figured it out

but mostly it was
me who figured it
out figured out the
secret of whatever 

[more thoughts than there are words]
it was I am the one
who figured it all out.

I totally created this fake profile on Ok Cupid
using this picture of some handsome guy I found
on Google Images.  He gets so many hits and
messages it is unbelievable. I spend hours
on my own profile liking pages and sending
messages and getting next to no responses.

I'm jealous of my own fake profile.  How can this
fake guy catch the attention of so many women?
He's tall, and handsome, well-educated, and well
traveled.  I've almost never been outside of 
California, I'm the shortest guy in the universe
and my academic credentials are garbage.

Maybe I should add a few inches, a few inches is 
always good, and maybe then I will get more 
responses.  I'll put post doc under the education 
section and select white as my race. The women 
will kill for me! it will be awesome!

There is the real thing, and then there is the fantasy,
and we are all in love with the fantasy.  Reality is
something we try to get away from.

Booty Privileges [i told you not to hold out]
by Kenneth Larot Yamat [but you held out anyway]
I demand access to that booty.  I have that right

according to the Constitution.  Congress shall 
make no establishment relating to the prohibition
of booty, nor shall there be any debate regarding
the prohibition of booty access. [and I'm really annoyed]

It's the 921th amendment to the Constitution.  It was
tested in the court case Booty V. Kooter and it was

determined in a 5-4 swinger vote that booty prohibition
provisions shall be read to deliver maximum constitutional
protections, even where no protection is utilized.

Thirty-seven percent of people do not have adequate access
to the booty, and twenty-seven percent of those with sufficient
access do not have regular access to the booty, and even among
those that do have both adequate and regular access, only 
twenty-two percent actually enjoy the booty.

Strike the Date
by Kenneth Larot 
Yamat

I really hope that this girl I met on OK Cupid cancels
on me. I really don't want to go out. [there was a strange]

I really would like to sleep with her
and maybe have some fun
or whatever but [thing that i was thinking]

I really would rather spend
my money on something else
I really would like to spend my money
on something really cool

I really want to buy more stocks
that pay dividends
I really love dividends even though at the same time
they kind of suck

I really want to message her and get an answer but
I really fear that she might 
confirm our date and
I really don't want to be out any cash
this week

I really would rather buy cocaine and snort
it than take her out
I really think I could save
some money by smacking the monkey

Ok Cupid Responses
by Kenneth Larot Yamat

1341

The one word responses area the worst.
They make a point I guess. She doesn't
dig me enough to say more and that is ok.
But why respond in the first place if you 
aren't interested?  This doesn't make any
sense.  People are bored I guess and want
to write something back.  Some of my 

introductions are very short, sometime I 
just want to get a match off my list so I don't
have to keep looking at them.  Big booty 
ladies that don't respond.  Huge boob ladies
that are really webcam girls who send me

links that ask for credit card information.
Phone sex operators who charge by the
minute.  Hookers who charge by the act and
by the hour.  How do the applications for these

bogus profiles even go through?  Does anybody
see that these profiles are clearly hooker ladies?

[and change everything strange] by Kenneth Larot Yamat

I'm trying to think about ways to make some
extra money.
	I think. If I could cut grass.
that I could make	a fortune.
I would		make		so much money
that I could start	a grass cutting		ETF

and put it	up for sale on	the stock market.
People would invest in my grass cutting ETF and it
would trade at a premium to the underlying securities.
And investors would love me.  I would be on the cover
			of every investment related

magazine and	people 		everywhere would know
my name,	and people who knew me from this or 
that 	school or this	or that job would say that they
once went to school with me		or that they once
worked with me, and how I was such a great guy and how

happy they are to know		that I made it and
how cool it is to start a grass cutting business and how
cool it is to let outsiders invest in the grass cutting 
industry and how cool it is to ride around a big huge
lawn on a lawn mower, and how awesome it is for the
environment to recycle	old grass clippings.

strangers. There's really just too much shit 
to do. There's really just too much fucking 
shit to do. People get made if you don't waste 
time, but there really isn't a hell of a lot of 
time to waste. Why don't we watch TV all day? 
Why don't we play computer games all day? Why 
don't we chat about politics and all this other 
shit? All fucking day? Well, for one thing: I 
have all kind of other shit that I need to do 
all fucking day. and if I'm going to waste time, 
I'm going to waste it the way I want to waste it.

how did they 
smell
well
let me put it
this way

they had an odor 
similar to that
of humans!

I don't know why
but they are a strange
group

those chickens
they are really 
strange I don't

I don't know much
about them and they
are hard to understand!

when it all comes
down to it I really
think that everything

is going to get
a whole lot
MORE AMAZING!

i'm not even joking
when I say this but I really
think that things
are going to get
more. AMAZING!

Some of the tweets on twitter are incomprehensible, 
and I've realized that. Yeah, I should just 
focus on writing poems, really.

Not even World * War * III * and IV 
happening at the same time!

[not even an asteriod hitting the earth] #haiku

not even a global plauge* not even a global famine *
not even a super volcano eruption * not even an extiction
level event could compare to the hard times I'm facing
not even an alien invasion not even world war iii

I really have to try to stay off twitter. 
I have to try not to get too caught up in 
the twitter discussions. This is a major 
time-drain considering that. I really have 
no effect on any of the situations that I 
tweet about. I'm going to focus strictly 
on the things that matter to me.

but the chickens * were talking to * one another * and they 
all came up with * the same ideas about * what to * do next 
and they all said that everything would be fine, even if things
did not get better and even if things did not get more amazing 

Alexander [little did they know that things would get] Pushkin
more amazing * things would get more awesome! * corn would * fall
from the sky and they would have all the food that they could ever 

Alexander [want to eat all the food they could need all the] Peresvet
eggs they could possibly want would be all they could ever eat! and 
nothing would stop * them from being happy * very happy * chickens!
Well, there were a few things. One is that I got my meningitis vaccine. 
Fucking expensive. Really fucking expensive. I paid out of pocket. 
Really fucking expensive. Jesus. I don't really know.

1373

the chickens were * very spoiled * brats who got * everything
that they could ever want and never asked for anything because
they were such total brats! the worst chickens in the world! 
but it wasn't too much of a big deal because a bunch of pigs 

came over to tell them how Þ amazing the weather Ȳ is in Florganistan
where the flowers grow tall and feed all of the chickens who need 
all the food that they could eat and if anyone was hungry they 

would have food enough ƿ to eat and corn enought Ȳ to enjoy! 
if there was anything else D that they could need Y they got it! 
and whatever else that could delight them, including the outbreak 

of world war III Ʉ could not be a merrier Ѵ occurance
of world war III Ʉ could not be a merrier Ѵ occurrence 
anyway, the chickens told the pigs Ɏ that all was well 
and that everything would not be worse than before and 
even if all things could be challenging it would not be worse 
all of them told stories Ж about the sad things that happened 
about the extinction of the humans and how they were sad 

that it all came down to how many Ѯ chickens were eaten 
and how the chickens could only act in response to the acts 
of evil that the chickens could think of when the chickens 
had wings that were * more or less * not very * useful

[there were a pile of chickens who] Kenneth Larot Yamat

Yeah Nancy, I wouldn't even be bothered by being denied

Excommunicated from the Holy See by being baptized an acolyte

[they went off the rails and everyone went nuts] Kenneth Larot Yamat
[they went crazy for cereal like cornflakes! and!] @KennethLYamat

frosted flakes as well * I was able to get home * in time * for corn 
flakes I was able to eat all the corn flakes I could possibly want 
Too many fucking distractions [and yet I was angry anyway because]

there just wasn't enough milk * to cover the corn flakes * and, well * that'S
it. there just wasn't enough milk to cover the corn flakes so I used horchata 
instead of milk · I wasn't thinking that horchata was more evil than milk 
but it was the time before the beginning 5m of world war iii so there wasn't
Yeah Nancy, I wouldn't even be bothered by being denied communion in 
accordance with canon law 915. I was actually Excommunicated from the

so. You know. It's like that. any milk to be had, there was a massive 
global famine - and a plauge Kenneth Larot Yamat it was the beginning of 
world war iii and there was a major famine @KennethLYamat there basically 

was no more milk! * I went to were the cows * lived and ate grass * and 
yet there was still no more milk, there was a major global famine and 
What I have to think about is this: Should I be stressed out? or not?
World War III was just getting Started! so there were major shortages
of pretty much everything * it was a nightmare * but it wasn't * worse

1375

it wasn't worse than before - Anyway, There really isn't any point.
at least not for me, i was already having a hard time in life before
world war iii broke out, so the outbreak of world war iii had no effect 
on me, except for the fact that there were fewer people around, and 
I had more time to myself, and more space, and more things to look at 

and there was also less traffic * and that was one of the silver linings
of the outbreak * of world war iii * and the famine that happened at the 
same time · and, well, it didn't make much of a difference, it was sad that

there was a world war going on, but my life was already 42m hard before
Okay: Twitter Blue or Twitter for Professionals? Here's the thing: there 
is a Twitter Parody Policy for Professional Accounts, and I've never 
figured this out, how is a factious remarks focused account different 
from parody account? and at what point have I crossed the line?
Kenneth Larot Yamat - so world war iii didn't even bother me too much.
@KennethLYamat everyone who had an easy life before hand was bothered 
but not me. I was not bothered by the outbreak of world war iii · my life 
was already hard, and world war iii did not 2h make it any Harder

The Alexander Peresvet laser weapon is named after Paris Alexander, the

PLC (Société anonyme). so. You know. It's like that. {started and it was not fun}

but it also wasn't really a big deal for me * for me personally * i was already
having major difficulties in life before world war iii * so I guess I was prepared

Yeah Nancy, I wouldn't even be bothered by being denied communion in accordance 
with canon law 915. I was actually Excommunicated from the Holy See by being 
baptized an acolyte of Christianity & Company Incorporated, PLC (Société anonyme). 
so. You know. It's like that. I thought: well, this is what world war iii looks like 

it just didn't seem like a very big deal * my life was already a pain in the ass
so i wasn't even bothered * things were already hard * and, they weren't too much
harder during world war iii. most of the other people who had easier lives before
world war iii were bothered by the major nuclear war, but I bought a jacket, and
even though it was really cold during the nuclear winter, i wore my jacket.
