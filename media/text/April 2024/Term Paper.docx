Term Project (Group-based academic paper)

The Term project will be a group-based academic paper.
This is the same group as the term paper
The paper should be a through investigation of any topic related to IT and innovation


Should present an introduction/motivation about why this investigation is important
 

Should review the relevant literature


Should develop a theory or some conceptualization. You could develop propositions/hypotheses


An option is to collect some data to test the conceptualization. This enhances the project. However, I will also accept a
purely conceptual paper


Form your groups by the first 2 weeks and also zero in on your topic

Check with the instructor about your topic and sharpen it.

There will be only one submission per group. Choose a team leader who uploads
all team member names should be clearly noted on the title page
If there a name missing, s/he will not get credit for the project!
Grading will be group-based â€“ that is, all members in the group receive the same grade
Instructor reserves the right to assign/reassign members to a group based on need.
Weekly Topic Presentation (Group-based)
There will be a topic presentation each week, on the respective topics
Each topic will be presented by a group (it will be a group presentation). 

For example, the second week is on the first topic,
business value of IT. It will be presented by a group where they will discuss each of the assigned readings and present their
thoughts. The others who are not presenting, will then ask questions and there will be a class discussion.

Each group will present only one topic. There are 12 topics across the 4 modules.
