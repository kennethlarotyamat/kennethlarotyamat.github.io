to the world that we are the greatest one person team
on the block. well. okay maybe not the block, but at the very least, a few lots in each direction.

okay, we will see if we can work together as a team, or if this will 
result in nothing but trouble.

p.s.
i'm really not sure how much I trust you, but i trust that you are trustable.

hard most of that time: I'm still only at the beginning." - Gustave Flaubert
