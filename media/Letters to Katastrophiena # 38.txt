I'm feeling incredibly scatter brained. I have a project due for my software and web development course today, and I haven't even started. This should be simple, so I'm not too worried about it, but, at the same time, I know from the past that these things could take quite a while if I hit a brick wall.

There are other issues that I'm facing, especially on the income front. The temp assignment was not a particularly good fit, and, I really get the feeling that I should avoid any kind of warehouse or factory work, even though, that's sort of what I've been doing for the past five years, but I don't have the slightest clue what to look for.

Life is such an unbelievable struggle. I don't really know what to do about money. Somewhere in the back of my mind there's this voice telling me that I should stop looking for a job or employment or whatever, and, that I should focus on trying to make money doing stock market shit.
