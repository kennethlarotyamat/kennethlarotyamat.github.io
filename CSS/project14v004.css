                                        very much time or agony. [New Note] I don't always like centering text, but I only have
                                        DIV titles right now, and I don't really anticipate long bodies of text. [04:09]

                                        I don't want to resort to this, but I'm ready to just use images, rather than iframes for the carousel, but I'm not
                                        really sure if that's the issue, because if the carousel can toggle a series of names, I'm sure it can toggle a series
                                        of iframes.

        [Development Commentary]        One of the issues that I had with the carousel, was that I had a different bootstrap version
                                        in place than the documentation example that I was following, I had version 5 active, and the
                                        documentation example used version 3. continue revisions based on the original project.

                                        a lot of the issues come from clashes that occur between flex, block, and grid display. with
                                        this newer version, I went with all flex. or, the main containers are all flex. [10/04/2023 14:46]
