that other github account just. really isn't working. so. I guess I'll wait. I deleted all the other repositories, then
deleted the main repository, the created a new main respository for that account. and I'll wait to see if it publishes
to GitHub Pages. I tried deleting that account, but, to no avail.

I still haven't started on the testimonial,
and I more or less haven't started on Project 13, and
I honestly haven't been able to fall asleep.

I want to get some rest first, and then start
on Project 13, but I'm having a really hard time
falling asleep. I spent mountains of time on project 12,

but honestly, I really think that what I came up 
with was worth every minute of the hella-ton of hours
that I spent on it. I really love the customized responses.
